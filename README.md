#Title:
Exploration and Implementation of hybrid statistical Learning Methods

#Team Members:
Shailesh Jain
Arsh Anand
Ankit Yadav

#Objective:
The project demos a method that learns the word frequency and word embedding for the psychotherapy counselling transcripts data.
The main focus is on sessions related to following five categories
	a. Sadness
	b. Anxiety
	c. Depression-emotion
	d. Frustration
	e. Suicidal-ideation

#Workflow:
1. Processing and Parsing of the given transcripts.
2. Representation of transcripts in various format for the purpose of analysis.
3. Perform the word frequency analysis of all the document.
4. Obtain the dictionary based on tf-idf ranking based on each of the given category.
5. Study the feature representation using vector representation as well as the classifier to see their impact on performance.
6. Learn to obtain the word based analysis for each of the document.
7. Implementation and clsssification of the documents using BOW model.

#Implementation:
Programming Language used is Python.
Weka workbench is used for analyzing different classifying algorithms.
