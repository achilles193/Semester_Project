TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Here she comes, to greet you. 
MOTHER: Hi there.
KEVIN: She missed us.
THERAPIST: She did.
FATHER: We were here last time and she wasn’t here [inaudible]
THERAPIST: That’s what happened. I knew it. She could’ve just done the session with you.
FATHER: So, so sorry about that.
THERAPIST: That’s fine.
FATHER: Well, I put iCloud on my computer.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
FATHER: And I hate it. It doesn’t work well with Outlook.
THERAPIST: Yeah, no it doesn’t. It you know which I have much more luck with Google integrating with it. And if you have a Mac you can use Busycal, which is not very expensive at all. 
FATHER: I’m just using iTunes and it seems it works with my...
THERAPIST: For calendaring?
FATHER: Yeah.
MOTHER: Really? iTunes?
FATHER: Well I do it on Outlook, but it syncs up to my phone through...
THERAPIST: Oh, if you use if you set it up for Google it’ll go live, so you don’t ever have to synchronize it, just like my [inaudible] automatically updates.
FATHER: And Google knows everything about you.
THERAPIST: Well, they might, but I don’t actually ever log on to it so it has no influence. And I don’t use the e-mail. It’s just the server, and it’s double encrypted so Ruth, are you just running away?
MOTHER: Well I have no excuse. I am so sorry because we all missed it, all of us. I’m sorry. We don’t like...
THERAPIST: It happens.
MOTHER: Well, not to me.
THERAPIST: It happens.  I had I just about missed an eye appointment the other day, got it on the wrong month. And I don’t know how that could be. And they called me, fortunately, and I got it moved around, but if it hadn’t been for that I was took me until this month to realize what had gone wrong 
because then the appointment showed up, and I was like what in the world.
MOTHER: Wow.
THERAPIST: So it happens. And as rigidly as I calendar, I was expecting not to [inaudible]
MOTHER: Well, I think with me, we were usually doing Wednesdays, and we got messed up around the holidays. It wasn’t a Wednesday, and it was out of my brain capacity.
THERAPIST: Well, so you’ll have plenty to update me on. Now really is the when’s the last time you were in here?
FATHER: It’s been four weeks.
MOTHER: Has it really?
THERAPIST: So it really was December 23?
FATHER: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay, wow. Well I’ve missed you. 
MOTHER: Are you really? Okay.
THERAPIST: That’s what I have down and that’s...
MOTHER: All right.
THERAPIST: 20 actually 18th I think. So...
MOTHER: Gosh it doesn’t seem that long.
KEVIN: Mm-mm. Seems like it’s only been about two weeks.
MOTHER: We’ve seen you since then because I’ve talked we’ve talked to you about I after one day of him not being on medicine I...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you’re right...
MOTHER: ...one of us was going to not make it.
THERAPIST: ...because I wonder if I have a note misplaced. I’ll have to look. So my gosh.
MOTHER: Yeah, I’m sorry, it was like the second. We were here on the second, Thursday.
THERAPIST: See I think every time I start a new year, I have problems misplacing these things. But I’ll find it. All right. So, catch me up folks.
KEVIN: It’s kind of a blur to me.
MOTHER: I think kind of one of our deals right now is that he’s just not tolerating the patch at all.
<span data-id="P1-N20068-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Oh? 
KEVIN: Mm-mm.
MOTHER: And...
THERAPIST: In which of the ways do you mean?
MOTHER: Itchy.
KEVIN: Stings too much. It literally stings, so I ended up taking I end up taking it off around sixth hour.
MOTHER: Well the other day...
THERAPIST: Is that new, because I didn’t think you were having trouble.
KEVIN: It’s been a long time that I’ve had it, but I just put up with it. But it’s just annoying me now.
THERAPIST: Well that is one of its potential downsides.
MOTHER: And I did some research and called some friends, and there’s wives’ tale kind of remedies that help, and nothing has helped. So I think...
FATHER: We’re just having him swallow it now.
MOTHER: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: That’ll do it.
MOTHER: So, that’s kind of the newest thing. I think we need to keep looking.
FATHER: It was either that or the forehead.
THERAPIST: Was it working fine it was working fine except for that, was it not?
KEVIN: I didn’t feel like crap as I usually did with the pill, but I didn’t eat as much.  But then it’d wear off at the end of the day, and then I was really hungry.
THERAPIST: Now you’ve got to remember that’s not a side effect; that’s the main effect. It’s going to happen no matter what. So you just have to eat anyhow, but so the last thing you were on prior to Concerta or prior to Daytrana was which thing?
MOTHER: Focalin. And it we liked that, but then it got to...
KEVIN: I lost weight.
MOTHER: It got to where oh, I know. He didn’t he just didn’t like that feeling, the jittery feeling, and then kind of hungry but you’re not hungry kind of feeling. And...
THERAPIST: You it’s the same medicine. [inaudible] is the same medicine as the Focalin. I don’t have much experience with Focalin. It’s a different all it is, is a different method of getting it in your system.  And for some reason people don’t usually like it very much, so they don’t I don’t 
know why. I don’t know what’s different about it.
MOTHER: Well, I shouldn’t admit this to you. Can you arrest people? I actually tried...
THERAPIST: You gave it a shot?
MOTHER: I did.
THERAPIST: No, I’m...
MOTHER: I did.
THERAPIST: No, I’m serious about that; you did.
MOTHER: I did, and I tried it one day and it was awesome, and I was getting stuff done. I got up the next day thinking oh, I’m going to do it again. I’m like I don’t want to feel that again though. Although this was working, there I know exactly what he was talking about. And it is a feeling you feel 
every second of every day. And it’s have you ever ODd on caffeine, for instance?
THERAPIST: No, no I drink [inaudible] very careful in my dosing, so...
MOTHER: Okay. Well I’ve OD’d on caffeine before and that’s it’s just it’s exactly the same thing. I get it. And I remember waking up that second day thinking well, I have more to do so I’m going to take another one. And then I’m like you know what? I don’t want to feel that again. 
THERAPIST: Well, so let’s let me define your experience a little bit. So first of all, when you’re going at the medicine cold, it the first two or three days are going to be like that. Like my daughter, all she wanted to do was clean the garage the first two or three days. And she’s seven. So it 
was weird. And then that went away, unfortunately, before the garage was clean. So it that is not unusual, but that’s not the effect one is looking for. And it shouldn’t actually last very long after more than two or three days. The second thing, and assuming that it doesn’t last for long, you kind 
of have to remember is how when did you first go on medicine?
<span data-id="P2-N200AA-dsp"></span>

KEVIN: I have no clue.
MOTHER: Fourth grade.
KEVIN: Fourth grade.
MOTHER: So that’s four years ago.
THERAPIST: Well for you, the experience [inaudible] medicine seems [inaudible] because you’re not used to thinking like the rest of do.  So the I would say that normally, after you’d been on it for a week, but my son doesn’t when he’s off it, it’s very uncomfortable for him because he’s grown up 
thinking knowing how his brain is supposed to operate, and when it doesn’t operate that way I mean he doesn’t mind being off of it because it’s kind of a random time, but he’s ready to go back on it because that’s the normal way to be for him. That’s why I asked you when you started on it. We’re 
pretty good about making sure people because Evan went on it in second grade or no, that isn’t true, he went on it in first grade. So he doesn’t have any conscious memory of being different than that. So that’s part of the experience. 
MOTHER: May I ask so is he who’s monitoring his medication? Is he going to just...
THERAPIST: My guy?
MOTHER: Your son.
THERAPIST: Well, okay, that is a good question. In the future, it’s kind of like at Disney World. [inaudible] and they have the Epcot in the future, tomorrow, it will be not for my kid, but we’ll have available Olive, who I think is was Olive sitting with you guys one time? No? She’ll she’s 
a nurse practitioner who will be, when she’s finished with graduate school in December, will be able to prescribe. That will allow us to tailor medicines much more closely. So my kid goes to his primary care physician, both of my kids do, but because never was this intended, but because that person 
is also works with us in the community with other clients, we have a working relationship.  So if I say hey, I think somebody needs to go up on medicine or something, he assumes I know something about that. So it’s a little odd. That’s how it ought to work. That’s when I say it’s odd, it’s odd in a good way.
MOTHER: Right, right. Kevin is...
THERAPIST: Gosh, Ruth loves it when boys come.
MOTHER: He’s awesome about I call him, okay, Daytrana’s not now I haven’t called yet, but every time we’ve had a problem he’s been wonderful. He listens to my suggestions. So this is not at all anything about him, but I just wondered whether I just didn’t know.
THERAPIST: Well it’s regardless of who you’re working with, it is an experimental process. And this is the first time I realized you guys were having a problem with Daytrana because I thought he was doing pretty well on it.
MOTHER: Well he was and it was a little bit [inaudible] but now he fights me every morning.  No, I shouldn’t say that wasn’t out of the blue. He, every he talks about the itching, and we’ve tried to look figure that out, and we put the KT tape over it so but he’s just recently I don’t want 
to do that anymore. I took it off in second hour, that kind of a thing. I’m like $220.
THERAPIST: Well this is not oh dear, didn’t you have the coupon.
<span data-id="P3-N200C8-dsp"></span>

MOTHER: I don’t have a coupon.
THERAPIST: Why didn’t you get the coupon?
MOTHER: Where do you get a coupon?
THERAPIST: I know I told you about the coupon.
FATHER: You mentioned a coupon but you you said you were able to get them for that.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you just Google. Just Google Daytrana coupon and they float down from heaven. I just updated mine the other day.
MOTHER: I went on and there was an Rx card, but I Googled that and that looked like a scam.
THERAPIST: If you just go to Daytrana.com, the first thing you will see is savings plan. And it’s true of Vyvanse too. Has he been on Vyvanse?
MOTHER: Yes. Vyvanse we didn’t have a good experience.
THERAPIST: I thought that was right. 
MOTHER: But I’m not I’m questioning whether because he’s had bad experiences not on Vyvanse now, so I’m just wondering whether that was the beginning of...
THERAPIST: In terms of anger?
MOTHER: Yes, so I’m kind of wondering whether I would like to try the Adderall site [ph] again, is where I’d like to go this time.
THERAPIST: Well definitely, then, get the coupon for Vyvanse and go down that route, would be my next suggestion for your physician. Because it generally, on average, mostly has fewer side effects. And generic Adderall seems to sometimes have a problem. People who were on brand name Adderall do not 
think the generic was as effective. And there’s some questions. I actually site a person at the FDA in my book as saying she’s heard it too many times about generics in general to think that they’re isn’t some kind of problem. So they haven’t been able to establish that, but nobody tests it. Who’s going 
to pay to do controlled studies of generic medications?  Nobody I know. So...
MOTHER: Well, that’s really...
THERAPIST: And that makes me a little nervous about generic Adderall.
MOTHER: It’s great to know. When he was on Concerta it I loved Concerta. It was wonderful, except he didn’t eat. Other than that but...
THERAPIST: Okay, but if Concerta worked, here...
MOTHER: I loved Concerta.
THERAPIST: Come back to reality for a second. Ruth will be there in a moment. Here’s the more important issue. And I love you, Kevin, you’re a great guy, and Ruth thinks you’re awesome and she’s about to jump over the back of the chair, but you’re kind of a whiner about medicine. And you’re going to 
have to buck it up and be tolerant of some of it. Now if you’re having itchy skin, okay, I realize that’s the shortcoming of the ADD people. They hate those things, and I understand. So then maybe you need to go back to Concerta. If it worked well and the Daytrana worked well, except for it being sticky, 
and you’re then you’re going to have to eat; you’re going to have to will yourself to eat.  This is the only way it ever works.
KEVIN: I loved to eat when I was little and but I lost 20 pounds on that pill, and I’m not going back to that.
THERAPIST: The pill did not make you lose weight.
KEVIN: Well, I know, but I didn’t eat because of the pill because if I ate, it would feel like I was going to throw up.
THERAPIST: For you to be on enough medicine wait a minute, backup, what did you say?
KEVIN: When I was eating, it felt like I was going to throw up.
THERAPIST: When you were how old?
KEVIN: This was sixth grade, right?
MOTHER: You were on Concerta first, so that was fourth and fifth grade probably.
<span data-id="P4-N20100-dsp"></span>

KEVIN: And then at the lake you took that picture of my back.
THERAPIST: Picture of your back?
KEVIN: Remember the back, shoulder blades sticking out.
MOTHER: Oh.
THERAPIST: I don’t dispute you lost weight. I am saying you didn’t lose weight because you took the pill. Now that’s why I made you back up and not [inaudible] because you’re saying you felt nauseous on it.  And did that last for very long because that is a side effect early in the medication?
KEVIN: It lasted until we got off of it. And I know you’re probably not going to believe this, but every time...
THERAPIST: I’ll probably call you a whiner, won’t I?
KEVIN: Well it literally every time that I tried to eat, it felt like I was going to throw up. I mean you know that feeling when you want to eat but you can’t eat because it feels like you’re full and then if you eat it feels like you’re going to throw up? It was that feeling times ten.
THERAPIST: Well, one thing you’re kind of forgetting is how bad has that been on Daytrana?
KEVIN: It hasn’t been as bad as that. It’s...
THERAPIST: Okay, part of this is you’re older now and you are more able to manage yourself. And Daytrana and Concerta are the same medicine. They’re exactly the same medicine except one is on a sticker and one is in a little nuclear [inaudible] medicine leaks out into your stomach.  So the only possible 
and none of that throwing up business on Vyvanse or feeling like that? Did you have that feeling on Vyvanse?
MOTHER: You were...
KEVIN: I’ve had that feeling on all the pills.
MOTHER: Well Vyvanse you were only on for about a month before we we thought that was increasing his anger. But...
THERAPIST: I would like to do placebo trials on you. That’s what I want to do.
MOTHER: Can he live with you while he does it?
THERAPIST: Well there’s... I get your point. I would like to do placebo. And it’s very easy, okay. We will actually, as long as your doctor doesn’t have a problem with it, with Vyvanse it’s super easy because you can it’s an FDA approved it’s approved by the FDA to break the capsule in water and 
drink it.  And some days you’ll put it in there and some days you won’t. And we’ll see what days that he has stomach problems. Because I think you may be psyching yourself out about this. Well I know you don’t believe it and that’s why we’re going to do a scientific study. We’re going to...
KEVIN: Every day that I’m off the patch at school, I literally I go up and I get two entrees because I’m so hungry.
THERAPIST: No, no, I don’t doubt the part where you’re not hungry. But not the part about being nauseous. That part I am having problems with. Because it is I do know people who’ve had that. But the problem is that you’re not as motivated about this as I wish you were.  You can also put it in applesauce, 
by the way, but you have to eat all the applesauce.
FATHER: In terms of the patch, if it didn’t itch, would you take would you put the patch on?
KEVIN: Yeah.
FATHER: You don’t it doesn’t bother you how you feel or...
KEVIN: It just affects my eating.
THERAPIST: But it doesn’t make you that’s going to happen no matter what. We all agree. No matter what, that’s going to happen. But it’s this nausea thing that I’m trying to figure out.
KEVIN: That was more I kind of it sounds like I stretched that a little bit. What I really meant was when you’re really hungry, your stomach’s queasy. It’s and but and you want to eat but you also don’t want to eat. You know what I mean?
<span data-id="P5-N20132-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Yes.
KEVIN: You want to eat but if you know you eat you can’t.
THERAPIST: There’s a difference, though, between eating some just enough calories to keep your weight stable and feeling like you’re when you’re sick and you can’t eat and you know that if you eat it’s not going to go well.  And I think you’re talking about the first one, not the second, right?
KEVIN: Second one was in sixth grade, right?
THERAPIST: The one where you just where you felt throwing up, like you’re sick when you try eating.
KEVIN: The second one was in sixth grade.
MOTHER: I don’t know if I remember you feeling like you were going to throw up. You kept saying nauseous but...
FATHER: I can remember him saying that.
MOTHER: A weird feeling. You remember him...
KEVIN: Okay, and...
FATHER: ...not wanting to eat because it didn’t make him feel good.
KEVIN: And in sixth grade I was always embarrassed because I didn’t eat because I knew I was going to be sick. And in sixth grade I had 27 sack lunches in my locker because I couldn’t eat. And I was always embarrassed about that because I would never eat. If I was really desperate to eat and I knew 
that I had to eat, I couldn’t do it. 
THERAPIST: If it was chocolate ice cream you couldn’t eat it.
KEVIN: No, I really couldn’t. If it was prime rib I still couldn’t eat it.
MOTHER: He lost ten pounds and he I mean he was he looked like...
FATHER: A pterodactyl.
MOTHER: Just and so I can’t imagine he wanted to look like that. Do you know what I mean?
THERAPIST: No, I know. I’m not the only thing I’m disputing is that you could not eat.
KEVIN: I really couldn’t. I’m I could not eat.
THERAPIST: Because that is unusual. It is not unusual to have no appetite and it is 95% of the time we can work around it. And but you haven’t lost any weight on Daytrana, have you?
KEVIN: No because some days I go off of it, and sometimes I take it off before lunch, and because it stings so much. 
THERAPIST: When do you take it off? Well, now, see this is all new to me. You weren’t taking it off and we had a big dispute about you taking it off in October and you were taking it off. That wasn’t the stated reason you were taking it off. You were taking it off because you wanted to be done with 
the medicine. Secondly, you’re telling me sometimes you take it off before lunch and then you’re hungry?
KEVIN: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: No. No. Not possible. There’s [inaudible] hours’ worth of medicine left in your system after you take it off.
KEVIN: I know, not right before lunch. I take it off and I know that I always thought there was around two hours during the wash out.
THERAPIST: Roughly two and half, yeah, roughly two to three.
KEVIN: And so I usually take if off in PE because when it the medicine’s soaking in, it feels like ten wasps are on your butt, just stinging you repetitively. That’s literally what it felt like. And so I had to take it off. And when I took it off it also sting it also was stinging really bad.  And 
then about five minutes later it was gone and I was fine for the rest of the day.
<span data-id="P6-N20168-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Does it leave the red mark? I have seen...
KEVIN: Oh yeah.
THERAPIST: Here’s the weird part.
KEVIN: And the skin is cracking. Not cracking, but it’s really dry, really dry skin.
THERAPIST: Well I had somebody in here the other day. I’ve never run into this. And she is a great and just think about this. And they’re not the same person, so we can’t prove anything, but metaphorically. I had someone in the other day, and that crazy patch is leaving red spots on her that stay 
for about a week. I know. Isn’t that weird? And I said oh my gosh. It’s a kid your age and the mom was in here. Said oh my gosh, that seems really terrible. And she says no, I can’t feel it; it’s no thing. And it’s they have to keep moving it around. She’s like a checkerboard.
KEVIN: That’s what our does. That’s what mine does.
THERAPIST: Okay, but that’s what’s so weird to me, is she doesn’t feel that but it’s still there.
KEVIN: It’s still here right now, and it’s dry skin. It’s probably not there still. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, but you’re putting ointment on that for that.
KEVIN: Yeah, I just started doing that yesterday.
THERAPIST: It’s that subjective feeling of stinging I’ve never heard before. I’ve heard a lot of other things, like it leaves a rash sometimes, and she didn’t even have the rash. It was just odd.
FATHER: What about the tape? Could it be the KT tape?
THERAPIST: Oh.
FATHER: I mean maybe you’re allergic to the KT tape.
THERAPIST: The adhesive on the tape.
KEVIN: Maybe. Well it doesn’t leave a red mark.
FATHER: Have we tried other types of tape that may work?
KEVIN: The first tape that you brought home.
THERAPIST: Where have you gone tapeless?
KEVIN: I’ve never done that because it usually falls off.
THERAPIST: Do you put have you tried putting alcohol not on the tender part because that would hurt, and I don’t really want to hurt you.
KEVIN: I’ve never tried it.
THERAPIST: On the part wipe it down with alcohol first, let it dry, which’ll happen quickly, then put the patch on because oils the only way that patch is not sticking to your skin is if your skin is oily.  And I’m not being offensive by saying it probably is. You’re a young man this age and it 
might be. Because I’ve never not that’s not true. The last time we had adhesive problems with Daytrana was in probably 2009 when they had recalls. They had nine recalls on Daytrana because they couldn’t either couldn’t stick or the adhesive was doing this to people. And we just haven’t had that 
problem since then.
FATHER: Now they’ve got super glue in it.
THERAPIST: Yeah you could do that.
MOTHER: That’s...
THERAPIST: That would...
FATHER: Try taking it off after that.
KEVIN: Gorilla glue.
THERAPIST: That wouldn’t hurt at all.
MOTHER: We haven’t tried the alcohol.
THERAPIST: Yeah, if you you might try that. And try the experiment of leaving out the tape and because it has to stick long enough for you because you’re taking it off early. And if you’re hungry at lunch you shouldn’t be any hungrier at lunch taking it off at PE than you would be otherwise because 
there’s still medicine in your system. 
KEVIN: PE lunch is my fifth hour.
THERAPIST: What about what’s breakfast been like? We’ve had this discussion before.
KEVIN: We...
MOTHER: Just grab something quick.
KEVIN: Yeah, I just usually grab something quick. Sometimes I just run out without just end up running out the door.
<span data-id="P7-N201B2-dsp"></span>

MOTHER: Well I mean it’s available, he just [inaudible] but you what do you normally eat? Just cereal.
KEVIN: Usually cereal. I drink...
MOTHER: Oatmeal.
KEVIN: Yeah, I drank a big glass of milk today.
THERAPIST: Okay, well your medicine, are you when are you putting that thing on? I can’t remember.
MOTHER: Later than we’re supposed to, like 7:30.
THERAPIST: Well, for our current purposes, that’s good because if you will eat way more at breakfast then you don’t have to eat a ton at lunch. Just something, like some oatmeal, fruit, peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
FATHER: Bacon.
THERAPIST: What’s that?
FATHER: Bacon.
THERAPIST: Bacon.
KEVIN: I have a lot of bacon.
THERAPIST: Something at lunch that’s just enough to get you through the days because breakfast and dinner are the ADD people’s meals. The lunch is never going to be any good for you. So if you can weigh up the breakfast, whatever he’s taking, up the breakfast. And I don’t even care if you take it after 
you eat the breakfast. If you’re on Vyvanse, it will kick in fast enough. So will Concerta because the outside of that capsule is coated with methylphenidate so it kicks in pretty quick. So if you can take it after you eat or as you eat, that might help with the nausea later. Just we’ve got to come 
up with a better solution than this. And you are a smart guy who solves problems. You like to fix things.  You like to go out and spray paint the wheels of the tractor. You are always solving problems. This isn’t that hard. There’s got to be a way. And then you eat a big meal later. You’re surely hungry 
by seven in the evening aren’t you? Eight?
MOTHER: Well...
THERAPIST: if you take the patch off at noon and you’re not hungry at eight, I don’t believe it.
MOTHER: Well you come home and you eat all sorts of snacks.
KEVIN: Well yeah, after...
MOTHER: ...and then you’re not hungry for dinner so...
THERAPIST: Oh, well that’s...
KEVIN: No, no. After the days that I take off my patch, then I’m hungry. But the days when I leave my patch on I’m not hungry.
THERAPIST: You do understand there’s a logical fallacy in which that you’re telling me if you take it off at PE, which is at, what, ten o’clock in the morning?
KEVIN: First hour.
THERAPIST: First hour.
KEVIN: So seven...
THERAPIST: Then you’re hungry by lunch.
KEVIN: Seven yeah.
THERAPIST: But if you left the patch on and took it off at three, you wouldn’t be hungry at dinner. Well you aren’t getting enough medicine in your system [inaudible]
KEVIN: No. Never mind. 
MOTHER: Kevin, is there a reason, maybe, you don’t want to take the medicine?
THERAPIST: Yes, Kevin, do tell.
KEVIN: It’s just I can’t be myself, and it’s annoying because I’m always serious all the time when I have the patch on.
THERAPIST: Yes, that’s in my book, verbatim. He just said almost took a sentence out of the book.
KEVIN: And I don’t like being serious. I like being serious but not all the time.
MOTHER: Now I’ve known people who’ve been on the medicine and they’re zombie like. And I would I never wanted you to be zombie like. So I don’t see that.
THERAPIST: And just for the record, I’m not trying to argue with you, but I’ve never met anyone who’s ever been on a medicine and been zombie like in my entire career. I’ve heard this, I’ve heard people say it, I’ve never sat in this office and never [inaudible] And I know they must exist but that’s 
because we don’t ever let anybody be on a medicine that would leave them and say it doesn’t actually make a lot of sense [inaudible] What he says about being too serious, that I’ve seen.  Believe you me. The problem is, as I actually discuss this in the book, that a person has to think about being 
who they are. And the problem is, see, that’s why I told you the Evan story early on. Evan thinks who he is, is a person who can focus in school and read at the seventh or eighth grade level when he’s in third when he was in third grade he could read at the eighth grade level. And he thinks that’s 
who he is. And when he’s off medicine he thinks that’s not who he is. And the problem is you think that who you are is an off medicine person, and I would argue that’s not actually who you are. You may like that because you don’t have to be as serious, but the point of being in school is to be serious. 
If you want to negotiate and not take as much medicine on the weekend, there’s ways to do that. 
<span data-id="P8-N201F8-dsp"></span>

FATHER: I think you hit it on the head.
THERAPIST: People don’t usually call me. If it’s nobody important I will hmmm.
FATHER: Go ahead.
THERAPIST: This is Henry Thome.
THERAPIST: I can’t imagine that the school district is now using phone calls to tell me we’re picking up canned food for the food drive. That should be if the kids are locked down and there’s a shooter.
MOTHER: I agree.
THERAPIST: If they want to send me a text or something it’s funny, but they just started doing this, and I never told them to use the phone to do this. If I see a number from the elementary school I think oh my gosh, my wife hasn’t picked Evan up. She forgot him. 
MOTHER: Right, right. I agree. I don’t like...
THERAPIST: Sorry about that.
MOTHER: I don’t like that.
THERAPIST: It’s so rare now that anyone calls me; they always text. And so when the phone rings I think uh-oh, somebody’s in crisis.
MOTHER: Right.
KEVIN: Oh, and I also have another story about me and Dad...
THERAPIST: Your dad was saying the most important thing ever when the phone rang.
KEVIN: Do you remember what you were going to say?
THERAPIST: Yes, what were you...
FATHER: No, I have no clue.
THERAPIST: Because he was agreeing with me.
FATHER: I think that’s right on. I think he thinks he’s perceived or off medicine is who he is as opposed to I think that’s right on.
THERAPIST: And that’s the same experience you had only I think you had the super nuclear experience. I think after two or three days then you would start to question wow, who am I; I don’t seem the same. And you have to always, at your tender age, you have to always ask the question: am I more impaired 
than I want to be, and therefore has medicine helped me.  At your age it you are not going to be able to be a successful student and express your intelligence, which you have plenty of, without learning to become friends with the medicine. And there are ways you can strategically do this so that when 
you don’t want to be serious then you can do that. And when you need to be serious you can be. But you kind of want to not be serious more than is helpful. And you’re a generation, again, man, who think not getting serious is a pretty great deal. I’m watching them wash out of school and college left 
and right right now. I did a show about that last year.  So we want it is critically important. And your parents, I know they’re super annoying parents, are trying really hard with you to get you where you need to be. And I appreciate that because I see a lot of parents, and you’re going to punch 
me, Kevin, but Ruth will bite you if [inaudible] You are there are a lot of parents who get to this point and they say and I hear about it because the kid’s in college now, and they say I remember back in eighth grade, right, and he didn’t want to take it and so we decided well, we can’t fight him, 
what are we going to do, shove it down his throat. And so we quit giving it to him. And I’m like how did that turn out? And they’re like well, he only failed half his classes from that point on, and we just thought maybe the ones he succeeded in he’d be okay. And then we’re two years into community 
college and you have a 1.3 GPA.  And everybody looks back and they say it was that eighth grade year. Everything was going fine and we decided to give it a try and get off it. I probably have 200 stories that go that way. So even though it’s annoying, we have to find a way.
<span data-id="P9-N20220-dsp"></span>

FATHER: Well even Mom told you that the other day, about how we care and that’s why we’re doing it. It was a good speech by the way.
MOTHER: Thank you. It was true.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and I also have an example in my book of when people try to get you good ideas and eventually they get frustrated with you and say well, you’re just going to have to learn the hard way. And what I say in the book is that’s not an invitation; that’s a threat. And so I don’t want you 
to learn if you ever hear me, and I will sometimes someday you’ll hear me say [inaudible] well guess you’re going to have to learn the hard way. That’s me threatening you.  And I don’t want you to learn the hard way, Kevin, because this is the beginning of when school gets harder, and we just have 
to find a way to make it...
KEVIN: Today in math I we’re doing this thing where we simplify a problem. It’s like y minus x equals 6. Then we have to do what is y, what is x, and how does it equal six. So we do three minus I mean nine take away three and it would be six. And so we do 9, 3, and then we find out another way to 
get six. And then we graph it. But we also have to simplify it first. There’s different problems. What would be 3x plus 4x equals...
FATHER: 12x, or 12. 
KEVIN: No, it’s just, I don’t know, but then you have to graph it. And I my brain exploded halfway through that because I couldn’t understand anything that she was saying. And I forgot my glasses today, and each time that I don’t wear my glasses I get behind. And she has her projector this close. 
The screen’s right where that couch is, and she has a projector this close to it so the thing’s this big. And I can’t see it at all. And I’m the third row back which doesn’t help. And yeah, so I had to go in advisory and get help.
THERAPIST: That sounds like a crappy day.
KEVIN: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The medicine was over by one and when class was morning or...
KEVIN: Actually, we took can you just tell him that later?
<span data-id="P10-N20234-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: She took your medicine for you?
MOTHER: Okay...
KEVIN: No. Here’s another thing [inaudible]
MOTHER: You’re going to call the police on me. I started taking Adderall, the...
THERAPIST: Whose Adderall did you start taking? 
MOTHER: I talked to the doctor and he was on board. He was like we’re trying this. So I just have the smallest dose and it the short duration.
FATHER: This is right after the bra story, is when she...
MOTHER: I can’t...
KEVIN: You wanted to...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that was a good one; I love that.
MOTHER: Well it actually the conversation...
THERAPIST: Are you on it today?
MOTHER: No.
THERAPIST: I didn’t think so. I’m going to watch and see if I can tell. Okay, you’re on wait. So you’re on her Adderall? You people...
MOTHER: It’s the short okay. It’s the short duration, whatever. So I am thinking I’d like to try Adderall again before we spend $220 on a new medication. I did. I gave him one of my Adderalls for a couple of days. Two days. So...
THERAPIST: Fast acting Adderall.
MOTHER: Fast thank you. I knew there was...
KEVIN: They’re so fast acting I can feel it dissolving in my mouth.
THERAPIST: Right, that’s not fast acting but I know what you’re saying.
MOTHER: So but it’s the lowest it’s the 5 milligram or whatever.  And so we give him one in the morning and then when he gets home from school this was yesterday I gave him another one that would how long is that, six hours? Four hours?
THERAPIST: Yeah, they don’t last very long. That’s why it’s fast acting.
MOTHER: Oh.
THERAPIST: Four hours, that’s why you end up taking two or...
MOTHER: I was thinking it was six.
THERAPIST: Well, they also say Adderall XR lasts, I don’t know, eight or nine hours, and I’ve never known anybody well, maybe one or two people. That’s what the difference with Vyvanse is, it really does last longer. Now, sometimes it lasts too long so but the thing you don’t really want to do is 
to get into a lot of fast acting because you will eventually start getting this. Now testing it that way, what did you learn? How did it turn out?
MOTHER: Well, see, he’s at school, so I don’t know. Do you know he says he was fine. 
KEVIN: I was I could also I said this about the patch, too, but I could be myself and I could focus whenever I wanted to, but then it’d last go away like an hour yeah, just about that.
THERAPIST: That’s about right.
MOTHER: I didn’t know that.
THERAPIST: So yeah, I mean the only I will say, and I normally would never say this, but if Kevin took two short actings a day, with the prescriber’s permission, and he could eat in between and he’d get his second one at the nurse’s office, it’s been years since we’ve ever tried that but it that’s 
one idea. But it that five is not very much compared to what he was on before. And so that theoretically that might work, but I would be concerned about what his dip point would be. 
MOTHER: Well, and would there be enough for homework, is my see, I was thinking he was lasting almost all day at school and then after school the other would [inaudible]
THERAPIST: If you take and this is all your doctor’s got to tell you to do this, not me, but many people who take short acting take three a day; that’s what they’re set up to take. But the problem is, then, that this is not something the ADD people are particularly good at remembering to do. And 
so I have people on fast acting because there’s a couple of prescribers in town that are just way too in love with it, and they give it out to college students, which I think is problematic. And the college students do because a) it does create a higher abuse potential and b) they can’t remember. They 
put it in their phone and make they forget to have the bottle with them, like the glasses.  They don’t [inaudible] so if...
<span data-id="P11-N20274-dsp"></span>

FATHER: And some use it to study.
THERAPIST: Well yes, and I that said, I have some college students who are so smart about how they manage their medicine that they really do control their doses appropriately, usually with Vyvanse, so that they get the maximum benefit out of it. But Kevin’s several years away from reaching that level 
of wisdom in his management. These are the stars. I mean these are the people who are really good with their medicine, and they have good prescribers they work with well. I think, actually, it’s more the kids work well with the prescribers. The prescribers sort of trust them and [inaudible]
MOTHER: Now these are under the Ritalin right? So...
THERAPIST: No, that wait, which one?
MOTHER: Well, see, maybe I’m I was thinking Vyvanse and no, Vyvanse and Adderall.
THERAPIST: Vyvanse is under Adderall. Adderall and Vyvanse are both amphetamine based although Vyvanse is complex. 
MOTHER: Right, Concerta’s Ritalin.
THERAPIST: Concerta’s a Ritalin.
MOTHER: Okay, so Adderall and Vyvanse are similar then? So...
THERAPIST: Yes.
MOTHER: So but you’re still seeing better results with Vyvanse.
THERAPIST: It does vary from person to person, but the reason not very many people are on Adderall XR anymore is because a lot of people had problems with it when it went generic, and the doctors, a lot of the doctors, are just going straight to Vyvanse. With the coupon the price is pretty good now. 
You guys are hitting a deductible, right? That’s your you’re aiming towards a deductible? Because eventually won’t you get a better drug benefit than that or not?
MOTHER: I think we’re...
FATHER: Go ahead.
MOTHER: Well I don’t know about the deductible, but I know that we end up being reimbursed for half. So for a $220 prescription every month, we get half that back. So I don’t know about the deductible. 
FATHER: Well, I think it’s like $200 on deductible for medicine. There’s office visits that are different. Five office visits for $25 and then after that until you get your deductible. But medical they pay a portion every medical cost.
THERAPIST: And whatever you get at your doctor’s office now is the same parity with us, so we haven’t learned exactly how this is going to work but you should have the same cost here that you have in the doctor’s office. We’ll see how that all turns out. Well I mean if it’s you certainly there’s 
no reason to not try an XR, an Adderall XR. There’s no reason not to try that if that’s more economically beneficial. I don’t think it’s going how much are you paying for sorry.
MOTHER: For everything that we’ve purchased now I don’t with the exception of Vyvanse, because I don’t remember, but...
THERAPIST: Yeah, what did you pay for that 5 milligram? 
MOTHER: Oh, hardly anything. Yes, in fact he gave me a prescription for XR. I went in and they you said it was $200 and some dollars I do that for my son. I’m not doing that for me. It’s...
<span data-id="P12-N2029C-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: The Adderall XR was $200 and some odd? That’s what I thought was going to happen.
MOTHER: Yeah, and so I went back and said I’m just me. I don’t anyway, he they gave me...
THERAPIST: Your... so your cost for Vyvanse is going to be less than generic Adderall XR I think. If you’re saying the XR, the Adderall XR, was $200 and some dollars, Vyvanse with the coupon will be less expensive.
MOTHER: Okay.
THERAPIST: I think maybe dramatically less expensive. I think you can get up to $60 off of it.
MOTHER: Okay.
THERAPIST: I have a copay on mine but so I only get $30 off, but I think that’s because I don’t know.  I have never tried it with this version of how drug stub [ph] is, but you want the thing you have to remember is it has to be sustainable. So whatever you can come up with. And it has to work 
and it has to be financially sustainable. I’m surprised short acting was that much cheaper.
MOTHER: It was I can’t even remember whether it was less than $20 or less than $10. I mean it was ridiculous.
KEVIN: You said it was $7.
MOTHER: $7. It was ridiculous. Yeah.
THERAPIST: All right. So which experiment are we going to next? You’re going to try the Vyvanse next?
FATHER: What do you think Kevin?
KEVIN: I just want to go off all the medicine, but I guess whichever one you guys think is best.
MOTHER: Well I think we’ll maybe make another appointment with Dr. Hughes because the last couple of times I’ve just called and he’s done me, but maybe it would be a good idea to go in and he’d probably...
THERAPIST: I’d probably go with the Vyvanse, but if your price is the same that’s what I would do. 
MOTHER: Okay. Yet you’re seeing better luck with the Vyvanse.
THERAPIST: You can do the same placebo thing with the XR by the way. I’ve just never done it. And back to you, Kevin, so is there any other reason you when you say you don’t really want to be on it, do you mean I don’t really want to be on insulin for my diabetes either. I’m kind of sick of it but 
I don’t have much choice or what are you saying?
KEVIN: I’m saying that I just don’t want to continue with the..
THERAPIST: That seems like the critical part of the sentence Kevin.
KEVIN: I know.
MOTHER: Do you need an Adderall?
KEVIN: I just don’t want to continue with the stuff that I’m doing. 
THERAPIST: The patch.
KEVIN: Any of the medicine. Medicine, there we go. I just don’t want to do anymore medicine but I know that I have to.
THERAPIST: So you’re saying it is like me and insulin. I don’t really want to take insulin but I could just die if I don’t, so I have to take it.
KEVIN: Yeah.
MOTHER: He puts up a fight.
KEVIN: And she goes. I just don’t like it.
THERAPIST: Well you do seem a little less focused today than usual.
KEVIN: Well I only took one, but I was supposed to take another one but I forgot about it.
THERAPIST: As to illustrate my case in point.
MOTHER: But he’s not acting like he typically does when he’s not on it because, I mean, you’re I can be around you right now. Because usually it’s struggles.
THERAPIST: I mean...
MOTHER: When he’s not on medication, yeah.  He might like who he is but it’s and you say act your age or be yourself but it’s not even goofy, it’s very...
<span data-id="P13-N202E0-dsp"></span>

THERAPIST: Weird.
MOTHER: Yeah, weird. Weird, but very much younger than the age, it seems, and then very argumentative and...
THERAPIST: Well I think one of the things that I want to emphasize to you, and I understand; I hear what you said; you did clarify it for me. It is like my diabetes example, and you don’t have to actually take shots to get the medicine in you, so I get the added benefit of that, but I think you’re 
I get that it’s frustrating, but I think you’re going to have to reach a peace about it, and not just like a they’re making me do it peace.  You’re getting old enough where you have to sort of see the value in it and yourself. And you are more able to focus on it, are you not?
KEVIN: Mm-hm, I am.
THERAPIST: That’s pretty critical. And then if you guys want to have some discussion about I’m not telling you this is a good idea, I’m just asking, I’m just saying, if you didn’t have to take it every weekend, would that be good? You would like that?
KEVIN: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: I don’t know how they would feel about that because...
FATHER: It’s kind of what he does now.
MOTHER: Well...
THERAPIST: Is that what we’re doing now?
MOTHER: No. That’s what he I mean the biggest fights are in the morning. I mean on the weekends. And I keep going but Dr. Thome says...
THERAPIST: I know. I’m not a huge fan of this but I have had cases where, for example, this is a perfect example for you. This girl I was seeing, and she said verbatim what you said, I’m just too serious on it, blah, blah, blah.  And she said and I said well give me an example, and she said well I 
just don’t feel like cheering for the team. And I said well is that really that important in life? And she said I’m a cheerleader. Oh, crap. So we agreed that she would not take it on the weekend and that she did not and it the only downside to that with her is she had a couple of car accidents. 
And they weren’t they were minor but it just all of us, her parents and me, we were all kind of white knuckled about it because we thought man, is this exposing her to increased risk. And driving is just around the corner with you. So in the long run it all paid off and it was okay, and she even 
got a cheerleading scholarship down the road, but the agreement was she would take it religiously during the week and do her homework, and then she had to get all her homework done before Saturday.  She was a competitive cheer; it wasn’t the...
MOTHER: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: Later she was doing by that time she was doing competitive cheer and so then she was able to not take it on the weekends. And that was the compromise. The thing is, she was whenever she was off of it she was bubbly and funny and everything. I hear you’re not as bubbly and funny off of it. And so...
KEVIN: Well, around my friends I am, but just they don’t think I am. My friends think I am but...
THERAPIST: Well you have admitted in here previously that you can be kind of irritable in those situations.
KEVIN: I can be but they sometimes think I’m very funny.
THERAPIST: Okay. I mean I wouldn’t be opposed to seeing you try that, but if you’re going to be super annoying on the weekend and people can’t stand you when you’re home, I don’t see how that’s going to work out very well. So...
<span data-id="P14-N20304-dsp"></span>

MOTHER: So can we have your number, so on Saturdays...
THERAPIST: Or he just maybe drop him off at my house or something. Great. 
FATHER: We might even slow down and let you out.
THERAPIST: You do see my point though. The other thing you could do if Hughes is okay with it, this is a little bit off label with Vyvanse, but if you’re mixing it in water, you can split the dose in half. Now I absolutely do that in my universe because that helps appetite on the weekend, but it keeps 
people kind of together. And you just the reason that that’s not FDA approved, or more correctly it’s off label, is because, again, they haven’t done any research to test it that way. But all you’re doing is cutting the dose in half. And I there’s a guy, weirdly enough, his name’s Peter Winchester, 
like the bird, [ph] that he’s a psychiatrist in Maryland that has a blog. And he’s a child analyst and psychologist.  He does a lot of work with ADD, and that’s one of his recommendations, is to titrate those. So you can do you can see if there’s any problem doing that. The part about mixing it 
in water, that’s on label, that’s in the instructions. It says you can do that. But taking a little less, there isn’t it’s just taking a little less.
MOTHER: Okay.
FATHER: Do you refrigerate afterwards?
THERAPIST: We don’t, and it says online, on the FDA thing, that you cannot store it, but there isn’t any reason not to store that. So and he says that he Winchester says he hasn’t had any trouble storing it. So you could refrigerate it if you wish. But just the main thing is you’ve got to shake 
it. It’s got to be mixed up good. And I don’t know that it ever fully dissolves. It may go into a suspension because it looks kind of cloudy in there, but if you shake it up good that will let you get a lower dose for the weekend, and that might be a good compromise. 
MOTHER: Okay.
FATHER: Because I try to convey if you are off it on it five days and off two, that’s not really keeping it in the system. I think that’s where you get the peaks and valleys as well, especially on the weekend.
THERAPIST: You come down harder. That’s true of medicines like antidepressants and such. The this medicine is gone from your system when it’s gone. But it does build tolerance, and this is allegedly controversial. I know I’ve talked to you guys about this before. It’s not controversial for anybody 
who’s been on ADD medicine for very long. Everybody who’s on them knows about tolerance. So he’s going to, in the week, build his brain’s going to expect the medicine to be there, and so he’s prone to more withdrawal on the weekends, which is why I think lowering doses is always better than being 
off of it completely.  And I say this about the cheerleader; I almost think maybe that’s what we did on the weekends, was drop her. I can’t remember. But we’ve done that in other situations. These medicines are not it is not a very straightforward path from here to there. It you are experiencing 
the complexities. I have a kid I see, we only just recently got her meds right after about two years. I hate to say that, but she needed them bad and had headaches with the different medicines, and she had a breathing issue with Vyvanse. And she was very motivated to make them work because her grades 
went from 2.0 to 3.7 on medicine.
<span data-id="P15-N20318-dsp"></span>

MOTHER: Wow.
THERAPIST: Really was benefiting from it. She, too, couldn’t finish sentences without it. And so she was motivated, but we finally got to Concerta and that did it.  Or she got the patch. One of the two. I think maybe the patch. And that was finally it after a long period of experimentation.
MOTHER: I loved Concerta. We actually ended up trying Intuniv as well, at the same time. But then he was I mean talk about...
THERAPIST: Right, that speaking of zombies.
MOTHER: That was awful.
THERAPIST: And actually that’s because it’s not a stimulant. And there are when I said I’ve never seen [inaudible] here on medicine, I’ve never seen anyone on a stimulant that’s been in that situation. Intuniv is a blood pressure medicine. It’s a time release version of Tenex. And it’s similar but 
not the same as Clonidine. And that is going to subdue your hyperactivity and lower your mood. And actually Winchester, in his book, says the main value in Intuniv is to control some of the irritability in the ADD people.  Well I don’t that’s not really that great.
FATHER: It just doesn’t give him the energy to do it.
MOTHER: I didn’t like I mean...
THERAPIST: That’s correct.
MOTHER: I didn’t like him on it, and I mean I’m the one going calm down, calm down. But I didn’t like that. That was bad.
FATHER: Clonidine, is that a blood thinner?
THERAPIST: It’s a blood pressure medicine. I take it for PRN when my blood pressure goes up, when I’m going on TV or radio, that’s why I sound so calm because it lowers your heart rate. Even though I’m used to doing that, it always raises heart rate and then your voice sounds a little shaky and [inaudible] 
that happening though. And I have PRNs and that. But yeah, so that’s you hit the Intuniv problem. That’s why it hasn’t taken off.
MOTHER: I just kind of thought that they would balance each other out and then he’d be but they did not.
THERAPIST: I have been down the path that you are on, exactly the same path, and we could also also used to try Strattera in tandem and alone, and the best that it could ever do for us was kind of get us through the summer.  And then I began to realize [inaudible] really helped with that. So you’re 
in a good experimental phase. You just Kevin, our only goal in life is to help you be a functional adult and to live out the things you want to do. And the bus you’re going to have to ride to get there probably is one of these medicines. So eat heartily in the morning and in the evening, even if you’ve 
got to eat later in the evening, the nutrition is [inaudible] recommend. And just get whatever you can into yourself at lunch. I would even offer you should eat Poptarts at lunch, as much as I hate them. Whatever it takes. Preferably the ones that have fiber or something that’s good for you.
FATHER: It’s got a layer of fruit in there.
MOTHER: Yeah, yeah. 
THERAPIST: All right, carry on sir. Ruth is passed out at the bar. Oh, she thinks it’s time to walk you out.
MOTHER: We mentioned Ruth to somebody the other night, actually, can’t remember what that was about.
THERAPIST: She’s on the website now. I gave her a degree as a certified animal therapist, CAP, and I have a note at the bottom that says this is just a joke. Cats cannot be therapists. Do not take me seriously.
<span data-id="P16-N2033E-dsp"></span>

MOTHER: All right.
FATHER: You have a webcam set up so we can watch her?
THERAPIST: Exactly. Watch her jump up over the back of the chair. See you later guys, take care.
MOTHER: Bye, thank you.
