I'm doing a thing where, you know, you just, like, are thinking about nothing in particular and then, like, I'll remember something I did that was, like, not exactly in line with the best image I have of myself. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">I, like, beat myself up about it a lot. (inaudible 01:54) (Pause) Oh, you cut that person off on the sidewalk.

(Laughter) (Pause) It's this weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">thing because, like, if we move, it'll be for James's job and moving, at this point, would be a great cost to me and a great risk for me. But I don't think James is like, I don't think he really knows what he wants to do.

(Pause) So [all this] (ph) talking about where we're going to go next is a little strange right now.

I'm not, like, actually doing all that well. Like, I'm I sort of feel like I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">okay right now but (ph) things are very precarious. [It's like, I don't know] (ph).

It's not great writing. I feel like I have this conundrum of when I'm really in motion, like, close to a topic, I don't write as well about it. But when I'm, you know, settled enough or far enough away to really pay attention to the prose, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">then I don't get at what I actually want to say about the topic necessarily (ph) as well.

Like, I don't remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">I feel like I don't remember enough about what things were like at Brown to tell why I needed to leave. I'm like, \"Well, I guess I must have had good reason.\" You know, considering the things that didn't make me leave or (inaudible 10:32). [I'm just sad] (ph) about not being there anymore.

Like, mostly (ph) it was, like, a few really interesting articles that people put up, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">a lot of articles that make me want to punch a wall. And then a lot of people talking about their lives that just make me jealous and unhappy. So maybe I should stop. (Laughter) Yeah. It's not like I missed it during the two months that I didn't check it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I hate being jealous.

I don't want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">to be bitter in the way that I am bitter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I mean, I feel like I'm a (ph) weird and prickly (ph) person all the time.

You know, like I can sort of perform the same reactions and mannerisms <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">and manner that I used to have, but it's not that easy. Like, it's not really what I want to be doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I told a woman at church about the ECT the other night. She was this older woman. I was just sort of trying out telling people about it. She's the woman in the lay liturgist, who's the person in charge of, like, making sure that the service runs. And so, and I was (inaudible 15:06) carrying the candles <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">and serving the wine and (inaudible 15:14). I said, \"Just so you know, like, I've had medical things that one of the side effects is memory loss. And so I haven't done this in a while, and I kind of forgot how to do it.

But anyway, (laughter) whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">It was fine, you know. Like, I think she was she immediately asked me if I got headaches or migraines, because she apparently she's in her, like, 60s I think, maybe 70s, and she had been worried that she was getting Alzheimer's because she would have these migraines and then not remember things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">afterwards. And her doctor told her that memory loss was from the migraines, not from Alzheimer's. And I said, \"No, no. (inaudible 16:15).\" I don't know. (Pause) I think what I wanted to say or what I was thinking about was that I, like, told her this and then I immediately tried to pass it off as not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">that big of a deal. Like, tried very, very hard. (Laughter) Like, \"Oh, that's fine. No, it was okay. No, it wasn't that good of an experience for me, but, you know, most people do well with it. Oh, no. I'm feeling better.\" (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(inaudible 17:18) everyone else who serves and that, like, who there are a lot of weird people at the church. (Laughter) I'm among friends. I'd have to try pretty hard to be the weirdest person in the room. (Laughter) Yeah. I feel like I think certainly this church, and I think other churches, tend <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">to attract (inaudible 17:52) lonely, awkward people to at least for, like, the (pause) at least for, like, lay ministers and helping lead the service (inaudible 18:14).

I think it's maybe that I haven't, like, have lost control or a conversation or noticed that I have lost control over the conversation. Or, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">trying not to try to control the conversation as much, and it just makes me panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess I just feel a lot more vulnerable in individual interactions with people.

I don't really know how people <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">are going to react to me.

Like, it sucks to say something to somebody and then feel like they look at you funny. Or even if they didn't, clearly everybody knows <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">you're a weirdo. I mean, it sucks, but it's familiar. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: And (pause) it may beat, like, worrying yourself about where you're at or how things are going.

Like, it's sort of trading the familiar feeling of being confident <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">or a fuck-up (inaudible 26:07) that already happened. Or the worry about how the big move is going to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Okay<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Or (pause) sort of telling the person at church about the ECT, and then immediately feeling, I think, kind of ashamed about having told her and like you are a weirdo, and you're standing out, and it's (inaudible 26:38).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: But that's still better than not telling people, in some ways. (Pause) Like, I would rather tell people and have the awkward reaction, than not tell people and feel like (pause) (inaudible 27:19) than not tell people and be sort of (pause) expecting that awkwardness to happen or feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">I can't live up to my side of the conversation (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like there may be kind of a struggle there, where you're telling people in part to help yourself feel better about it. Like, \"Okay, I'm going to put it out there. I'm going to deal with whatever awkwardness, discomfort there is. And then hopefully, that will help me to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">better about it.\" And part of you, like, to some extent, that's how it goes. And I think to some extent, you sort of (pause) put it out there and then sort of feel ashamed and (inaudible 28:11) and so forth. Like, if it preemptively, to kind of run from the uncertainty. But I do think you're right that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">it's both. Maybe I'm wrong about that, but my (inaudible 28:23) there's just kind of some of each.

I don't want to find a new church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess it's (ph) pretty much taken all you've got to, like, putting (ph) stuff in place and [live within here] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like I just, like, got a situation that might work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I guess this is something that isn't really in your control either, in a way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Not at all. Yeah. (Pause) If I told James we absolutely can't move, I think he would try to make it work. But, like, I don't think I could do that. Yeah, I don't think that would be right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Something else to worry about. That's what it feels like. All the worry was just kind of there and defused, and now this is just something to concentrate it on. Like, something that I can say I'm worried about, as opposed to being really worried. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Maybe [all the] (ph) worry is about (inaudible 36:50) things aren't great now, at all. The point is they're better than they were a few months ago. And that the crummy part about that is, like, you can be afraid of falling back into that, and moving could instigate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2320875\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I don't know. I feel like people might be [done with] (ph) taking care of me. (inaudible 38:20) I don't want to ask people to do that again. (inaudible 38:35) I don't want James to have to take care of me that much again. [I don't] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">(ph). (Pause) I feel like it'd be too much for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well, I imagine you feel moving as being abandoned, in a way, by James. By me. You know if you chose not to say to James, \"No, I can't do this,\" it would still be something that felt very much against your interests. I mean, even if you also felt like it was the right thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I think, you know, in some ways (inaudible 39:55) it would feel like [he is] (ph), you know, ignoring what was important to you or what mattered to you. I mean, I expect he wouldn't be, that he'd be thinking about it or weighing it. You know, listening to what you said about it. But, yeah (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: No, I think that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And by me as well. Like, (pause) I wouldn't be (inaudible 40:32) from that or finding some way to make it not happen. Or moving down there with you. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah, I guess that's\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: This is part of why you feel like you've kind of (pause) run out of (pause), like, (inaudible 41:11).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I want everything to stay exactly the same, which is so that I can get my feet under me. I feel like everyone around me is just, like, sort of exhausted from the last couple of years. My depression needs not to be the thing that everyone has to deal with for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: That's pretty much how you felt at every step (laughter) [I think] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I understand. Like, I'm not saying, you know, your depression hasn't weighed on James or been difficult or stressful for him (inaudible 42:28). I mean in a way, I don't really know, but it seems plausible to me, I guess. I'm just saying, I think there's often another part of the story, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">which is you never felt, like, except in those moments we talked about this, although I suspect you don't remember, that (inaudible 42:57) as sort of going to the hospital sort of moments where, you know, you kind of felt like, \"Okay, I'm done. I just need to (inaudible 43:04).\" Like, at moments like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B92\">that, you kind of give into that. But otherwise, (pause) you've consistently had to struggle pretty hard against letting yourself do that. Against not letting yourself do that. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's good to think about. (Pause) Helps me kind of check those tendencies (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think those (pause) there have been variations on it, but it often boils down to \"because the people around me [have just had it] (ph).\" (inaudible 44:06) just on the verge of getting angry, taking off. I'm done. In one way or another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: (inaudible 44:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, (pause) I'm not saying you never know (ph) anything about it.
