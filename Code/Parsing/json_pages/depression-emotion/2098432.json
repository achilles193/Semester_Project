data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: Where do you want to start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(Pause): [00:00:06 00:00:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I realize that like when I'm off of my birth control I'm really, really crazy and like super stressed and I was like, 'cause I (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: For like a week off or have you stopped taking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: For a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay. I wanted to get my period before I went to Chicago so I wouldn't get it when I was in Chicago so I was like, 'oh, well, for like the last week I'll just not take it that week and like it actually took a few days longer than normal to get my period and then like when I was like really miserable <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and stuff and I was just so afraid that like every time because I can't just indefinitely take the pill because like I mean it wouldn't be the end of the world to not get my period but like I, you know they prescribe it such that I have the placebo pill at least every three months and like I run out <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">that way and I don't know what to do because I'm like, this makes me crazy and biologically my hormone levels shouldn't like change that much for the week not having the pills but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Can you describe what completely crazy is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I was feeling suicidal. You say that a lot though. That's not \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So, tell me what the difference is because that's not the first time I've heard you say you've had suicidal thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It's not that (unclear) was on and on like every day, like it didn't really go away that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Okay, so they felt more persistent than they usually do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah and I was crying a lot and just always upset about everything, a lot more than normal and like so far that Sydney was like, 'you should go back on the pill,' and I was like, 'I can't, I need to get my period now,' like, and I did, but like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: What happens to your mood once your period starts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe it was just really because I was afraid that I wasn't going to get it and just like there is no way in hell I can be pregnant right now but like maybe I'd gained so much weight that I couldn't get my period or something, or, I don't even know \u2013 I know weight loss is an issue, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">I don't know if weight gain is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It wouldn't usually be connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Okay, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But it might take longer to get it because you sort of stopped taking it somewhat randomly rather than at the completion of a pack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, well I mean, that's how it's \u2013 well, theoretically at the completion of three packs \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: But is there a difference? I don't know what kind of pill you're taking. Is there a difference in the \u2013 like during the pack?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: No, they're ones that are the same all through. They're basically \u2013 because originally I was on the Seasonique that less you get, you know, everything (unclear)  and is designed for that but when my old insurance wouldn't pay for it then they switched me to something that was like the exact <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">same except not as conveniently packaged and not meant for, like the package, the way the thing is set up is not meant for only getting your period and everything, but it is the same chemical the same throughout and all like one (unclear), different at the beginning and the end. Like I've been on those <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">and they always color those differently, they're all pink except for the placebos are white. So, yeah \u2013 (jingling metal)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098432\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(Pause): [00:03:34 00:03:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: And at some point where I was like maybe I should get a hysterectomy or something because that's the only way to guarantee I'll never get my period and therefore never have these hormone fluctuations because I can't really think of anything else that would like do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: That's a pretty extreme thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: It is. But I don't want babies. So my uterus isn't actually doing me any good. It's just \u2013 like (unclear) of the fact that there are complications and that it would like, you know, I'd have to really, because like so many doctors would be like, 'oh, you might change your mind about kids,' and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I'm not changing my mind, especially (unclear).  Yeah, maybe someday I might change my mind like adopting kids but I just don't ever want to be pregnant, so all my uterine system is making me miserable with I guess, they're complications because I'd go through menopause early and stuff so it might make <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">things worse instead of better and I don't really know any way to prevent myself from going crazy when I'm not on birth control pills for a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: What were your thoughts like? You said they were more persistent. Were they different in intensity as well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Un huh. I (unclear) think so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Because I don't feel like you usually tell me that you're crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: No, but I just felt like I was being really crazy and irrational, like (unclear) being irrational, like I couldn't stop myself from being irrational.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: So then you're not only feeling irrational, but also frustrated with yourself for not being able to think more logically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: And I guess like, because I was like (unclear) oh, it's not the end of the world and Sydney was like, 'you're not taking this seriously as you should.' I'm like, 'there's nothing I can do about it right now.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: So what stopped you from acting on the thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I guess they weren't strong enough to make me actually kill myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">(Pause): [00:05:37 00:05:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, they were more (unclear)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: But they just felt more persistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">(Pause): [00:05:46 00:05:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: And this feels similar to like the last time you used the placebo pills and got your period? Or does this feel different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I don't know because I think the last time I got my \u2013 the last time was while I was in the middle of a whole like, I was still on Wellbutrin and that was when I was starting to not work. I think it was in November. Yeah, it was in November and so I was attributing the craziness to being off <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">the placebo, or off the regular pills and so when I was back on the pill things were better. So I guess it was similar to that because there was like, Wellbutrin wasn't working. You know I went back on the pill yesterday so I'm better now but I'm just like really praying for the future because I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">want to have to deal with this like every three months like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I'm just not functional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, for how many days?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: At least a good like four days I think. (Unclear) throughout those fours days, but \u2013 maybe it was three days, maybe the first day didn't really affect me that much. I don't really remember (unclear) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098432\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's hard to keep track when you're feeling so out of your head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I guess I was feeling for two days because like Sunday, Monday was okay. It was Tuesday afternoon when I was getting \u2013 it started like I was sort of freaking out because I went to visit my grandma so me and Sydney drove down and I was like when it was about to, just starting to snow and like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">I was kind of freaked out on the way down driving in the snow and on the way back there wasn't any snow but I kind of freaked out when I was driving and like then I stopped driving and it didn't go away and it was like that for the rest o the day Tuesday and Wednesday. I guess Sunday and Monday I wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">bad. It was two days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So two days of really intense sadness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: But also some anxiety in there from driving and how was your visit with Grandma?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It was fine. I mean she's like really losing her memory and stuff and so my parents asked me like, 'oh, did she give you a tour of the place?' Because she moved into the retirement community and I was like she didn't even remember what direction the caf\u00e9 was in for lunch, so no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: What was that like to see her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I mean I'm sort of used to it like last year when we were in Israel she was forgetting things like if she gave her purse to Dad so she could like go to the bathroom or something then she's like feel panicky that she couldn't find her purse and completely forgot that she had just given it to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">Dad to hold. So, I'm used to it. Apparently, they have a swimming pool there (unclear) . \"Did she show you the pool?' and like she didn't know where things were. We found our way to lunch just fine but yeah, it was fine, like (unclear) is stressful and I figured you know, whatever, she can ask about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200752\">my job stuff and I don't really care and she's not going to remember the answer anyway, so I mean I guess it's sad if you're not used to it, so it was not really (unclear) for stress or anything, mostly just the whole like, you know, it was snowing all the way driving down and we were afraid if we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200753\">going to get snowed in. But we didn't get snowed in. We were fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">(Pause): [00:09:44 00:09:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems to me that it was a little bit more anxious drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: On top of not feeling well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Kind of unstable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: I mean it must have started like mostly like during driving because otherwise it would have like been too unstable until I think I could go to (unclear) in the first place and I didn't so that's the only reason why I cannot remember that like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: You don't think you would have embarked on the trip if you were feeling as badly as you recall feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. I certainly wouldn't have volunteered to drive. So, yeah, it was mostly Tuesday night and Wednesday and Thursday. So, it wasn't that long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Was there anything that distracted you from how you felt during the two really bad days?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes I could be distracted by watching TV with Sydney or something like he actually, I told him like he should go to therapy last Wednesday, he goes to therapy and he ended up staying and taking care of me because he didn't think I was okay enough to be on my own even though I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">like (unclear) to go. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098432\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: So he was really worried too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he was really worried. I think he also wasn't quite feeling up to going to therapy either, but (unclear) . Yeah, Thursday I felt a little bit better. I guess also Wednesday was sort of hard because I was going to go over to my place and Sydney was going to come with me and that ended up <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">not happening and I was supposed to cook and I ended up having to push everything off and I didn't have clean clothes because I had thought, you know I only packed for through Wednesday and did didn't pack for Thursday so we did end up going to my place like Thursday but you know, I was really over-reacting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F2\">to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what seemed \u2013 in actuality was sort of a small change in plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, I wouldn't really though like wearing dirty clothes and I don't know why I couldn't \u2013 oh, I guess because I thought it wasn't really safe to drive a car because I was sad and that's why I didn't just go down by myself and come back. It just seemed like it was so overwhelmingly the world, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">even though it's something I thought we could do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: And I think that's a big marker, that something felt like the most overwhelming thing in the world when in reality it was quite manageable for you. And that's a place that you find yourself in pretty often. So, for different reasons I've never heard you say before that your period was this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">that going, you know, that going off and using the placebo week and getting your period was this traumatic for you. You know you're on the every three month plan to avoid getting your period because I know it's a difficult thing but you've never reported this to me although you have reported kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200952\">feeling like things are a bigger deal than they typically would be. You certainly have had suicidal thoughts in the past so this is kind of a place you go for lots of different reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Well, I guess I thought I was like getting better (unclear)  but then I had a week of just, well not a week but having those few days of feeling horrible, I'm just like there's no way to avoid it as far as I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Like isn't there something you can do to protect yourself knowing that it's a time when you're more fragile and that you tend to react really intensely to things that maybe some of the same skills you use to distract yourself from panic can be things that you put in place ahead of time to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">protect yourself. There's some things you can do to lessen the effects. You know most people have some sort of emotional reaction to the change in hormones that come along with menstruation whether it's on the pill or not on the pill so being able to set yourself up so that you can cope with some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200992\">those emotional swings and some of the physical pain that might accompany it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was also having physical pain but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah and that makes you \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: And I'm used to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But it takes energy to cope with that. So making sure that you have things in place to take care of that. I don't know if you can get pain relief, heating pads, Advil, you know, whatever you take that works for you but also things like having something pleasurable to do as a distraction set <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">up ahead of time because when you're feeling really badly it's hard to say to yourself, 'oh, I want to go do this thing' or the other thing, but if it's there already in place, you might do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098432\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes. I'm just having a hard time thinking what kind of things I can do, have set up to do that would make me be able to distract myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I mean you said TV was a distraction so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: It sort of works but not \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Well, taking the edge off helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So it could be something like if you knew that looking ahead in your pack when you're going to take the next break that a movie date or set up a game night with friends if you know when you're going to take the placebo week. Because you're less likely to back out of those things when you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">feel badly especially if you tell someone, 'make me go even if I don't want to.' But you're not as likely to set them up and I think if you stay involved and engaged you can thwart some of those thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I can see myself backing out of those things. You know especially if it requires \u2013 you know it's one thing to have people over to my place and it's another thing if I have to like drive. It's another thing if there's snow and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Okay. So take down some of those barriers. If you can see that you'd be more likely to follow through if you've invited somebody over, set that up for yourself next time. Make yourself as likely to succeed at helping yourself as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: I think the other thing is that they don't last all day and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: No. It would be a break, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">(Pause): [00:16:58 00:17:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: I feel like I didn't get anything done this week either, I mean I was also like sitting around waiting to find out about [Eventra] (ph) which I haven't yet because like when I've interviewed like two weeks ago Monday they said it would be a week or so, so like the next Monday came and I called <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">Tuesday and they were like, 'oh, we saw that (unclear) a couple of days. Don't worry, we'll call you.' So, it means that I don't think I can call them again and I'm sure they were not open on Friday and I'm pretty sure they may not be open today and like (unclear) (cross talk) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Process might have gotten stalled with the storm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, they normally like \u2013 they're only interviewing four people, total, or something, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: It's really hard to wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: I can but it's like, 'oh, well, I guess I don't have to write cover letters' and then I was like that's really stupid because I should have written cover letters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Were there things that would have been interesting to write for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Some, like I had to [measure tabs open] (ph) which I don't have any more.

Because nothing bad happens if you get the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">job offer and you've already sent in an application.

I don't want to inconvenience anyone but at the same time is job is not like working for me.'

And my boss goes like pretty understanding about it and like you know, wasn't mad or anything which I was really surprised about but, yeah. (Unclear) two weeks notice. I just wanted to get out of there as soon as <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F52\">I could and then Sydney picked me up so I felt like a lot better after that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad that helped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: With some of the stress you were feeling and (unclear) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: Especially if it's like (unclear) but I was working and it was usually \u2013 Thursday was really some stress because I was like, wait, what's going to happen when I quit, but usually it's like \u2013 it was just mindless but and now I'm still like I think I made the right decision but it's sort of screwed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">over because they are also saying when I talked to the lady from the temp agency like that, you know, (unclear) we'll worry about what if this happens in the future and I was like, 'okay, I'm completely fine with that consequence like I am looking for jobs in my field. So, like I don't think I can go <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD2\">the temp route any more.

It turns out like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201191\">(unclear) are going to be the ones who leave because they need \u2013 like no other space in the house would work for them, especially like because then they would have (unclear) to his father which basically that wouldn't work so they're going to find something and like they're \u2013 Aaron is going to start <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201192\">like, he's going to start looking into it like during winter break which is really soon and like would start the remodeling at the beginning of the summer so I guess you can say it's like going to disrupt the chores and everything else and also there's been a lot like a few times I interacted with him <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201193\">where he's very sad that his (unclear) turns out that he's \u2013 and then I realized at the meeting last week that he's actually like done with everyone and is not (unclear) and is really stressed.

I just don't want kids. I guess my parents are like you know, because theoretically Cullen can have children and Cullen and Doreen probably will have children because Doreen wants children. But, my parents are also big on how they want Jewish grandkids and Cullen and Doreen's children <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201491\">will not by default be Jewish, so I might still have had a lot of guilt because (unclear) after my grandfather right now and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: You might. Your parents' wishes \u2013 you have no control over what their wishes and wants are. That does not mean that there's something wrong about not having the same ideas as them. When that time comes you have to work on finding a way to be okay with your own choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: (Unintelligible) I can be like, 'sorry, it's a done deal.' Well, I mean I guess that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: That's true but that's an extreme \u2013 that's a big surgery and an extreme reaction to somebody questioning whether or not you're going to have kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: Isn't that it will also help with the not having a period thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: It might.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Or would it make things worse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: But forced immediate menopause is not going to be pleasant either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Okay. I feel like I don't really have any choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Well, but let's track what happens next time. I think basing your decision on this time it seems like your reaction, your emotional reaction to having your period was really intense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">THERAPIST: But I think we should pay some attention to what happens the next time and see if there's any ways we can somehow ameliorate some of the intensity. Because I'm really hopeful that there are things less extreme than having a hysterectomy that make it more manageable for those couple of days. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F1\">Or at least if this is even the pattern that it's this intense. You know, like I said, I was surprised to hear you say that your suicidal thoughts were so persistent because it's not something you've brought up in the past \u2013 which doesn't mean it didn't happen \u2013 but it wasn't something that was so present <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F2\">for you that it was what you came into session with. So I think we should track it and see what really is your response \u2013 is that intensity atypical for you? Are there things we can do to make it less intense if it continues to feel that bad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">(Pause): [00:32:18 00:32:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: I really don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so we really need to mark it down when you're expecting to take a placebo week again so we can really pay attention to what's going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: I mean it will be in two or three months, so not for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: So let's be prepared and let's pay attention to what your response really is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">(Pause): [00:32:48 00:32:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: Because like I know the hormonal IUD is like, I've heard that those can be bad with depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">THERAPIST: As well as can the pill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I don't know if things will just make it worse so also getting an IUD would be really bad for it, or if possible, possibly, so I don't really want to deal with that but I'd rather like, I can remember to take the pill every day since I have to take the other pills, so I feel like that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201711\">a huge reason why people end up going with an IUD is like because it might be more effective as a birth control strategy whereas I'm mostly thinking of help for like for my hormones and my depression, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20170-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20170-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098432\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: Well, so there are also other hormonal methods. So if this continues to be as big of a problem, you know, having some conversations with your gynecologist about if there are other options for you, other hormonal options that might give you some benefit without this side effect then I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201731\">we really need to see what \u2013 we can't make big decisions based on this one really negative experience. Because in some ways this has worked really well for you, it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah. Whenever I don't have my period I'm fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That's a lot of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">THERAPIST: How has exercise been? I'm assuming the storm got in the way a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like we've been \u2013 we did go on Thursday night for a little bit. Also on Tuesday afternoon we ended up walking around for a good hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">THERAPIST: I know when I saw you last you had discovered that new game \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's what we did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">THERAPIST: Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">CLIENT: And I even got here a little bit early and was walking around in the snow \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">THERAPIST: Sloshing around out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's really scary because I, like there are a [few distress charges of areas] (ph) like that aren't shoveled that well like ice and I feel like I'm going to fall because I've like nothing to hold onto so yeah, so it's still too snowy to like \u2013 and like we had originally thought, 'oh, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201891\">we'll go on Friday night,' like in the snow and it didn't happen which was really \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Seemed like a cold, windy snowstorm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">CLIENT: Considering how bad it was like today and this is even better than \u2013 it's not as bad as it was, like, I'm like, 'okay, I made the right decision to not go out.' And like yesterday I was supposed to have auditions for \u2013 yeah, I was like planning on getting there like 45 minutes early and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D1\">auditions were cancelled because of the snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you made some safe decisions with the storm and just even visibility is not really good with all the high snow banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">THERAPIST: Cars can't necessarily see people. Sidewalks aren't necessarily cleared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I'm \u2013 but we do have to go out. Like tonight we have rehearsal and possibly auditions if people can audition today so I might get there early and stuff but I don't \u2013 so it's working in as much as the weather is like not stopping us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">THERAPIST: Where you can't control what happens with the weather. But I'm wondering too if that might help. Exercise is often a really good mood lifter and can help just to change your baseline. So just as it helps you can lift your mood on a regular basis using exercise specifically targeted to when <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201971\">you're expecting your period, can help to offset some of that upset so you're not being able to get out as much and so as much aerobic exercise and the walking is really good aerobic exercise. So you didn't have that as much as you could have.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098432\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah, there's nothing I can really do to control the weather though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019B\">THERAPIST: There's absolutely nothing you can do to control the weather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and walking is one of those things that is impacted by weather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so just knowing \u2013 I'm not critiquing that you were unable to do it. I'm saying that knowing that that's one thing that could have helped had you had access. So next time around it's unlikely to be a giant snowstorm because it will be a lot closer to real Spring so making sure that that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F1\">a time when you do get out and walk or go out and dance \u2013 same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A3\">(Pause): [00:37:44 [00:37:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A5\">CLIENT: I guess it's also, I mean Sydney is getting better with his depression and like wanted to go out but sometimes he still doesn't want to go out either. I go out by myself or I don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A7\">THERAPIST: And if he doesn't want to go, you do go out by yourself. That's the healthiest choice for you and it's great when he can join you and also make a good choice for himself but I think one of the things about you feeling better is not being reliant upon him to join you. You making good decisions <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A71\">for you even when he can't. It gives you a lot more freedom to have that independence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A9\">CLIENT: I should be better about that but the snow got in the way of everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">THERAPIST: The snow was bigger than you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">CLIENT: Those piles are taller than I am. Some of them are at least. Yeah there's really nothing I can do until the weather gets better. It's going to take a while for all the snow to like clear out of the way I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AF\">THERAPIST: It will. Hopefully, sidewalks will be more cleared though and people will continue to \u2013 cities and towns will continue to try to clear sidewalks so that \u2013 you know, the snow banks are going to be there for a long time but there should be clear pathways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B1\">CLIENT: If I had a (unclear)  I could get rid of the snow banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B3\">THERAPIST: That would help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B5\">CLIENT: (Laughs) I really [thought a playther] (ph) are going \u2013 I think they're kind of illegal for a civilians to have.  As far as I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B7\">THERAPIST: I think you're going to have to wish on that one for snow banks to disappear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B9\">CLIENT: It like they have nowhere to go so they just pile everything up more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Yep, that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">CLIENT: It's also like how am I able to get to rehearsal if I'm not going to have a place to park and everything is all snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) parking is really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">CLIENT: I guess I'll splurge on cabs because \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that might be a good choice because parking is really very limited so even if you go it might be really frustrating to try to find a safe place to park.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">THERAPIST: So this is a good time to splurge on a cab and to be in the back of the car wearing your seatbelt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.

All those little tricks you have that you know work a little that don't erase it but they work a little to add them all together. So use what you can. So you can use your sun lamp, you can make it easier to get someplace and be social undistracted. You can do some <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201CF1\">stretching, or some exercises in your room since it's harder to walk around. These are all little things you can do.

Maybe there will be something in the mailbox today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20209\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020B\">(Pause): [00:43:33 00:44:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Okay? So obviously just call me if we need to reschedule and I guess I just also want to remind you that since you did have more frequent suicidal thoughts if you ever feel like you're going to act on that or have a specific plan you call the ER or get yourself to the ER right away. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2020D1\">generally you're able to have the thoughts separated from whether or not you're actually going to act on it but if it ever feels like you can't stop yourself or if you really are thinking about following through and hurting yourself keep yourself safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">THERAPIST: I will see you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
