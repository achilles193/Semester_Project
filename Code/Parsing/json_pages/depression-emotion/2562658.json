Come on in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(pause 00:00:11 to 00: 02:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Trying to think... think of what to say. (chuckles) (pause) Yesterday was, I guess like, a weird thing... not weird. It was like, a little unusual. As soon as I got to school like, a couple of my classmates were like, upset, were crying and so (chuckles). We spent like half the class time like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">talking with one of them (chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: What were they crying for then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Oh, just this one girl was just... One of our teachers is kind of... I guess he can come across as abrasive or aggressive. He cares a lot, he\u2019s, like, he\u2019s coming, this concern comes from a good place, but he pushes people like, to think harder, to be tougher. I guess that kind of rubs some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">people the wrong way. So she was kind of... she\u2019s been very sensitive all semester long, and I\u2019ve seen her kind of... there is a cloud over her and like... And yesterday she was just crying, so (chuckles)... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(pause) It was interesting, since my classmates are really, really tough (chuckles), others are, I guess, not so much. I wonder where I am like, I think I am like in the middle. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. (pause) In talking with, other people are talking, this one guy was talking about his father and... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">(chuckles) and then his own kind of, relationship woes and you know... Then I was just, I guess, thinking about... I also mentioned here like... I was taking a walk with Nelson (ph) and like, he\u2019s being all sweet and everything, but I felt kind of trapped. Then later I felt lost and... (chuckles). Anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">Yeah... I was just trying to understand why I was feeling, you know, trapped. He was saying thing like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s take a cooking class together. Let\u2019s do this, let\u2019s do that.\u201d And I just was like, \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Which is weird, because like, I\u2019m like, hey, I thought I was all about wanting affection, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">and attention, and love. Now that I\u2019m getting it, why do I, why am I pushing it away, you know? So, I didn\u2019t really understand where that was coming from, and I guess I suddenly felt, maybe I feel trapped and you know like, maybe I just want to... like go home and just like, sit with my computer, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">just read a book, but be alone and take a walk by myself. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I feel like... I need that time every like, 24 hours like, I need certain hours just to myself, when I\u2019m completely alone. (chuckles). Yeah. I think that makes me feel in control and like, I have to figure things out. I guess figuring things out makes me feel... yeah, in control. And it makes me like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">then seek out company. Like... yeah. (pause) Like, Saturday I had that like, well, not like, I mean, I was with people all along, all the time, but being with different people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">But I did have like, a half an hour for running. (chuckles) And then, you know, recognizing (inaudible) small room in the next room. So, yeah. (pause) (chuckles) I wonder, is it like, I need to be alone and feel scared and insecure? So that I can be with someone? Is that what that is? Is that what it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">is? (chuckles) Is that what means, with people in their own space? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That they want to feel alone and insecure?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562658\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. It can happen, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why people want to be alone (client affirms), the main reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: What is it, then? Why do they want to be alone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: They like their own company, they want their own company. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It could be, it could go in the other direction. I mean, they might come up, come out of it with positive things, at the end of that. Or they could also sometimes come out with negative things, such as... I\u2019m scared! I need some comfort! You know? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not possible, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the motivation, so that they feel scared and then come out of it. (client affirms) What do you think you feel scared of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Oh, when?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Like, when you feel, when you\u2019re alone and then you start to feel scared?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Now it\u2019s mostly, now it\u2019s mostly anxieties about writing and my mother and just general worries. Like scared of the future and all those things, not, I don\u2019t know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(pause) I guess on Sunday I was feeling... a few different things. Like, I was feeling guilty, because I haven\u2019t been in touch with Chris (ph) and like... You know... And... I haven\u2019t my \u201calone time,\u201d so I felt a little too saturated with Nelson. (chuckles) You know, I mean... That\u2019s what I feel like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">you know... like, saturated, you know? And I don\u2019t want to be saturated with someone else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(pause) Even if it\u2019s good, you know, that\u2019s what it is like... even if it\u2019s Chris, who I consider to be like, a superior kind of substance you could be saturated with, even when it\u2019s him like, I feel... okay, enough! I need... air to breathe, you know? Like... I need my own space. (chuckles) Yeah, on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">Sunday I was feeling...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(pause) And um... (sighs) Then we went to Nelson\u2019s parents place. They were showing me, you know their kids, showing us photos of this trip and (inaudible). I felt so lost like, you know like... I had no kind of... like coordinates that I could... points that I could relate to, I guess. (pause) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">then, (inaudible) I was like, Where am I? What am I doing? You know, I\u2019m completely like... I have no idea where I am and... try to... It\u2019s weird how that happens. I guess that people feel that way. It\u2019s not unusual. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m having a hard time understanding you (inaudible), I think in part, because I\u2019m having a hard time hearing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Oh. I think... Is it the fan, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: You, I can turn this off. Maybe that will help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I think that makes a difference. (therapist affirms) I usually, I just have like, a small voice and sometimes it gets really small. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: It does, sometimes get really small. (client affirms) (pause) What do you think makes it get small?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess when I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m... talking about. (chuckles) So... But I\u2019ll try, I\u2019ll try! I\u2019ll try to be, I\u2019ll try to project, I\u2019ll try to... feel powerful, I don\u2019t know. (chuckles) Or just humor myself. If it actually, the power doesn\u2019t come like, if I like, just take it lightly. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">I mean, I guess I\u2019m trying to understand like, this new... set of friends or, you know like, this new, this whole new kind of... way of... thinking or actually being, I guess, that I hadn\u2019t really experienced like this before. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562658\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">You know like, with Chris\u2019s circle, I would feel lost mostly, in an intellectual way. You know, they were all intellectuals and academics mostly. But some of Nelson\u2019s friends are kind of, you know, adventure seekers and like, you know, they go on long hikes or you know, they go skiing, or they want <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">to move to [] and... you know, just live there. (chuckles) So... that whole thing is, you know, very new to me and... I guess I feel lost in trying to relate to them, and trying to understand what exactly it is that they want and... They keep talking about this road trip like, cross-country road trip. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">I keep telling them, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can come!\u201d I\u2019m like, terrified of American highways and, you know like, it\u2019s a big risk, whatever; it really depresses me, and I\u2019ll be, you know, depressed for months or years. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It depresses you in what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I think I just have like, associations from my first few years in the U.S. Like, you know, my dad and... yeah. I don\u2019t want to experience that. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: How are road trips connected to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: But I just... get depressed. Even like, on a bus to Ohio, I, you know like, the four hours of... road is not... I don\u2019t like it. (therapist responds) (sighs) I try to read or sleep, but, yeah. So... It just reminds me of like, being in, you know like, back in Virginia and like... certain... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">nights of... a lot of nights, I guess, when I was I guess... going to visit my first boyfriend, or coming home from like... I had an internship in Tennessee, so I would drive through Tennessee and Virginia quite often, you know. And then like, the road signs that advertise whatever it is like, topless <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">bars or whatever and like, my association with like, my dad seeking all these places. I just feel like, vulnerable and miserable about those, that whole, those years. Because I was, you know, completely not in control, you know. Yeah. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">(pause) It\u2019s like, like... I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll join them (chuckles), but they keep telling me, \u201cBut it\u2019s all about the people you go with. We\u2019ll have fun!\u201d And all that. I\u2019m just like, \u201cI know! I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have fun, but I still don\u2019t...\u201d It will still take a week or more and I don\u2019t think I can... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">you know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">(pause) I mean, I\u2019d love to build new associations, happy associations, but you know like, how do you do that? (chuckles) I don\u2019t think you can plan for them, you know? They just have to happen if, you know, that means that... Again, think they\u2019re not in your control, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(pause) What is your experience of American highways?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t have a particular association.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: What do you think of, when you\u2019re driving? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Depends on where in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Just... Pittsburgh? (chuckles) I don\u2019t know!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Strip malls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. That doesn\u2019t depress you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Do you think that American highways depress most people? (client affirms) I see. There is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Shouldn\u2019t they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: What about them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Because they\u2019re monotonous and there is like, everything looks the same and, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Hmm. No matter where you are in the country?

Yeah, that was fun. But I was in control, you know. Like, I was, we drove it in the same amount (ph) like, from... even south of Albuquerque all the way to Houston, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">you know. We drove that distance and... that was fun, you know. Fun, as in, I don\u2019t know like... as fun as things can be when my mom would like... Not much conversation but, you know... still okay. (chuckles) And it was pretty, too. The landscape kept changing. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">(pause) I could do that like, if these guys go to Albuquerque, I could drive with them to... (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. Whatever, it\u2019s just, but I could do that. I don\u2019t want to do like... cross-country. I have no idea what the highways are going to look like and... (sighs) and what other signs for topless <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">bars or like, you know... or you know like, I see my dad (chuckles) as in, you know, not like, (inaudible) but metaphorically, you know? I feel like a little girl and you know, I feel cheated, and I feel out of control, or... Not out of control, but you know like... powerless and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">(pause 00:21:18 to 00:22:01)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">I mean, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like, I feel like experiencing things that I have no associations with, that\u2019s... going to feel nice. (chuckles) Or nicer than trying to change things that I used to think are bad or, you know, make me sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(pause 00:22:21 to 00:24:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">I don\u2019t know. I guess, I wonder if there is like, a pattern of... things that happened that make me like, feel trapped or feel like, feel powerless. I don\u2019t know. I guess I don\u2019t understand that right now. Do you think it\u2019s happening less often now, or like...? I\u2019m just trying to figure that out.

But if I can... stop myself from feeling trapped, then I can, you know, actually engage and kind of counter, whatever it is that makes me depressed, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">(pause 00:25:43 to 00:26:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">Do you think there are like, triggers that... I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well, let\u2019s talk about that. What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you felt trapped on Sunday, with Nelson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m trying to understand what happened with him. I don\u2019t know. But all I can figure out is that I didn\u2019t get my \u201calone time,\u201d so... but then, what does that mean, you know? What does \u201calone time\u201d do to me, you know? I\u2019m like, okay, it can one of two things. One is to fill me with like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">strength and like... you know, I can... I feel refreshed, and I feel like I know who I am, and... or it can make me feel insecure and like... I\u2019m needing comfort, I\u2019m needing safety or companionship, stimulation. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">I don\u2019t know what that means to like... why that has to be, to me, feeling... trapped or you know like, not having the \u201calone time,\u201d why that makes me feel trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562658\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">(pause 00:28:09 to 00:28:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">Because I think, I\u2019m sure I felt that way with Chris, too. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have been able to articulate it like this, you know? Maybe that\u2019s what I felt like in Colorado, you know? I didn\u2019t want to be with him at that time, I didn\u2019t feel stimulated enough, or I wanted another kind of stimulation or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">like, I was bored, you know. What does boredom mean, you know? Like, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s like a profound psychological (chuckles) condition. I don\u2019t know; is it? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: I think boredom can mean a lot of different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah? Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know; what are your thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Like, lack of stimulation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You said \u201ca profound psychological condition.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: (chuckles) No, I just wondered if like, as a student, you studied (chuckles) that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like I\u2019m too quiet today? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m just kind of, I feel like I\u2019m... tossing darts, maybe. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019re asking a lot of questions today, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re feeling more of a need to engage with me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Sure, I love engagement! (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling a little lost today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Umm... I don\u2019t know. (pause) I\u2019m trying to explore, but I don\u2019t know what exactly I\u2019m exploring. (therapist affirms) (pause) Yeah. I guess I feel uncertain about what I\u2019m talking (chuckles) about, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">(pause 00:30:37 to 00:32:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">I don\u2019t know. I guess I want to be able to better understand myself, and also understand that I might not be able to understand everything, but... At least moments when I\u2019m down (or really, really down), you know, that would be, it would be nice to kind of get a handle on those moments, you know, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">that I could avoid them. Or if I can\u2019t avoid them, then at least like, shorten them, so that I\u2019m not, you know, making other people miserable or uncomfortable, you know. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">(pause 00:33:22 to 00:34:24)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">It could also be true that, you know, when I\u2019m like, worried about something, everything seems bad. So no matter who I\u2019m with, I\u2019m not going to be able to enjoy their company or be... you know like, I do make (ph) myself. (therapist responds) So like, that was most of my relationship with Chris. I was, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">you know, constantly like... worried about writing or you know, not writing, that, you know, the few times we took, you know, vacations or whatever, I was just like... not a fun person to be with myself, and I expected him to be, to provide the fun, the entertainment. He\u2019s not really that way, anyway. So... (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">(pause 00:35:20 to 00:35:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">(chuckles) I wonder if like, Nelson is more intuitive that way? I don\u2019t know, I just wonder...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Intuitive in terms of...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: If you want him to be to articulate this, or you know, if he... You know, I\u2019m saying that... maybe he can\u2019t, you know. I\u2019m not saying that, \u201cOh, he\u2019s not smart enough to articulate that,\u201d but you know like, I was not being very fun, you know. He was like, on... (chuckles) so weird like, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">it was like, I wanted to take a walk. But then... so he joined me. But then like, as soon as we left his apartment, he was like, on the phone with his friend like, I don\u2019t know, \u201cWhat are you doing? Come join us.\u201d I was like, he just knows that I\u2019m, you know... not very chatty or, you know, fun right <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">now, so, he\u2019s already looking for... a back-up or like, somebody else to make, to give him the kind of stimulation he\u2019s seeking, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562658\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">We didn\u2019t walk for very long. He, because then we went over to his friend\u2019s place, which he and like... you know. (chuckles) So, I just wonder if he... he did that on purpose, you know. Or as in, like, he knew... that he could just feel that, you know, I wasn\u2019t going to be very... entertaining. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">he has that (chuckles) intuition, so... I\u2019m just like, realizing, you know. Because I don\u2019t think Chris would, you know. He\u2019s just not that sort at all, you know like, picking up the phone and calling people. (chuckles) You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">(pause 00:37:29 to 00:38:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">(sighs) But I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with either approach. Like, if you\u2019re sad and like... it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to prolong that sadness, and you just jump into other things, you know. But it\u2019s also okay if you are sad, and you don\u2019t really know how to change that moment. You stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">in it and you stay in it; maybe you find your way out, you know, by thinking things through, or you\u2019re just internally finding... an impulse or a stimulus inside you. You know, that\u2019s okay, too. It doesn\u2019t always have to come from outside, you know. I don\u2019t think it means that one kind of person or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">one kind of approach is stronger than the other or more reliable (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">(pause) I guess I am just like, afraid to be like that kind of, the down like, the dead and downer in their group, I guess, in Nelson\u2019s group. But, I mean, I don\u2019t, they don\u2019t think of me as that. I\u2019m just... kind of wondering if, you know, that could be... how I see myself in the group. (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">But, I think that\u2019s... I want to be okay with that, you know. (chuckles) I guess. I just... Maybe that means I dig deeper, you know. Like, I stay deeper and, of course, that has its problems, you know. Makes me kind of... sad and not entertaining all the time, but... you know, that\u2019s okay, you know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C52\">I guess I can find my way back to the surface, to the light surface, where they are. I just take a bit longer, you know? Like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">(pause) I guess like, in even like, my associations with American highways, see how it gets depressing and I\u2019m scared of it, but maybe if I am able to get over my fear of them, that I\u2019ve been avoiding them, that every, you know, at all costs, or whatever. You know, once I get over that, maybe... still <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">okay to have that kind of association or a story, you know... but, you know, I move forward or you know, at least I try to move forward and I... I can definitely appreciate people that having different associations, you know? I mean, so, yeah. So, life and other people make you kind of experience sadness <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C72\">in a way that not everyone else does. What do you do with that, you know? Like... (therapist responds) If you like, maybe I shouldn\u2019t beat myself over that. I don\u2019t know. (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: You have a lot of things to be sad about. (client chuckles) In terms of what happened to you. (client affirms) But you have so much potential for the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah? (therapist affirms) And when you say that, do you mean like, happy... or like... jumping off the couch (chuckles)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Maybe moments of that, but... I think, to have a really productive, creative, fulfilling life.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562658\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: I wasn\u2019t actually aware of the time. I was making a statement.

Do you feel like you have the potential for a, you know, fulfilling, creative life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: I want to.
