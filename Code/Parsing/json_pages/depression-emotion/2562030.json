I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which is not really \u2013 oh I think I met with her like the day after we last met. A day or two. So I\u2019m switching off Lexapro, and onto Celexa or Celebrex, whichever one is actually an antidepressant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Probably Celexa. I think Celexa and Lexapro you know how there\u2019s right-handed and left-handed molecules? I think one\u2019s one and the other\u2019s the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. She said it and I was kind of like, \u201cHmmm\u201d. Unfortunately she\u2019s like, \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to feel like crap for a while\u201d. And I was like \u201cOh well.\u201d Then awesomely right on schedule, I started feeling like crap the 23rd, 24th. Yeah, she had actually predicted that one of the worst days was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">probably going to be around the 27th, and it was horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s too bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. IKEA today with my parents, and my mom had offered to drive me home. But we had a little miscommunication -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m going to put this on. If you can talk a little louder. Right. She offered to drive you back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: There was some miscommunication about me staying three days longer, and when I realized that, it was like, I almost, we were all at my parents\u2019 house and this all came out, and I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can move, or go to dinner, or do anything, because, it was just like, Oh my God. I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">do three more days. Actually it would have been four more days at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Amazingly my parents, my mom did not freak out about me saying, So, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow. Which surprised me. A lot. But she didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: So this was what day was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Thursday, so like, Christmas was Wednesday, yeah the 26th. Yeah, it was like uhhh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Right, so you had the double whammy of ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think my mom knows I wasn\u2019t feeling great, because she was also being really anxious. And one of the ways that she likes to express this is just to stare at me a lot with a concerned face, or speak really loudly and try to drag me into conversation. Which doesn\u2019t work very well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">I deploy my brother as sort of a \u201cTalk to Mom, I can\u2019t do it\u201d. Yeah, I mean, the trip was, it was okay for like the first two days or so. It was like, okay, Christmas Eve happened. Christmas happened, that was okay. But, like, I don\u2019t know. The bed that she had me sleeping in is excruciatingly uncomfortable, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">and my brother\u2019s wife gets cold really easily, so the heat is at, like, 70, and I want it at like, 66 or 67, so I\u2019m always hot and sweaty and I end up having to buy myself two t-shirts so I could wear something. It\u2019s also frustrating because there\u2019s no one no one in my house, like, my brother, his <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">wife, my parents... the largest shirt in the house would probably be a small or medium. So I couldn\u2019t borrow anything, which always makes me feel awkward. This year, my brother\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I have a loose shirt\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, that won\u2019t fit\u201d. Having that argument is just frustrating. I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200294\">look at the two of us. It wouldn\u2019t fit. And, yeah, I\u2019m still feeling ... I just feel like garbage. I just don\u2019t feel good. Which is really frustrating. I told Ashby, I was like, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m doing this medication switch. Sorry. And one day, I think it was this weekend, I was cooking something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200295\">and Ashby was like \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d and I was like, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m good\u201d. I was keen to cook. And then I just suddenly was feeling super resentful and angry at her for not helping cook. Even though I hadn\u2019t asked her. In fact I\u2019d said no. Which made me feel so crazy, because I\u2019m just like... I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200296\">didn\u2019t even, you know... I was both upset like, I was still really upset about it but also thinking, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be, because you didn\u2019t ask, blah blah blah\u201d. So that\u2019s upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562030\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Sure. That kind of thing has been happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. When we were talking, Dr. Cobb at one point was asking, was worried that I might need to take some FMLA days off. I was feeling completely extra not great. Which, I don\u2019t know. Last week didn\u2019t happen. I was sick on Thursday. Friday, I had a snow day. So I feel like I\u2019ve only been working <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">for two days. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Did Dr. Bond estimate things would improve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: We were supposed to have met on Wednesday but she\u2019s sick. So, no. She\u2019s saying probably a month at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Why did you switch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I actually wanted to switch off the Wellbutrin, which we were talking about, but I had been having these sudden moments of feeling really, intensely weepy, and I don\u2019t know if they increased, but they weren\u2019t going away. So that concerned her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I don\u2019t know. My response was like, Oh, whatever. I\u2019ll tough it out. I can tough it out for a while. Which is usually my response. I do agree not being randomly weepy would be good. If, you know, I could do my homework and work it would be nice. So. I was talking to my mom about how Wellbutrin makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">me really sweaty, and Will, my brother was like \u201cOh, yeah, that can happen\u201d. And my mom\u2019s response was, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your psychiatrist give you another drug that\u2019s perfectly as good? That doesn\u2019t cause you to sweat?\u201d Thanks mom. It is that easy, mom. It was just so crazy. Like, oh God. It was mostly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">funny, but I\u2019m also like, given my mom\u2019s obsession with how her children should be medicated, I would think that she would know more about how that might work. And since Will has had major medication problems... interestingly she does not perceive them as bad medication interactions. He took Lithium <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">and it didn\u2019t work for him. And so my mom... My mom\u2019s theory is that my brother insisted on taking Lithium because dad took it, and that he was insisting on taking it even though someone, maybe her, said that he shouldn\u2019t. My thought is, I think they gave him Lithium because he\u2019s bi-polar and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D4\">what everyone does. But my mom kind of really blames my brother for it. It\u2019s very strange, I don\u2019t... I\u2019ve been asking her less about that, about her thoughts and feelings about my brother because it\u2019s super frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I also had this, I don\u2019t know, like, conversation with my dad that stuck with me, which was, I was talking to Will, I think I was talking to Ashby, my brother\u2019s wife Ashby, about my frustrations at work and how I felt so frustrated with Chet, and like, not being able to get him to give me work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">even when asked directly. She was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell I\u2019ve asked him, but he won\u2019t give it to me\u201d. And then the conversation sort of stops, which I understand, they don\u2019t have an answer. And my dad was just in the room, and I was like, \u201cWell, you\u2019re probably not paying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">attention, but what do you think?\u201d and he said, \u201cDo you want me to actually answer?\u201d So, his response was interesting. First he mentioned that I had expressed frustrations with managers many times before. Which is true. He feels that I do not communicate well enough. He thinks the problem is a communication <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">problem, along with a diplomacy issue, which I really disagree... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s... So I asked him to explain, because I was like, \u201cI think I know how to communicate\u201d. It\u2019s true that I can get pissy about diplomacy, but I\u2019m perfectly capable of doing it. I just don\u2019t always want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562030\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, first he gave me his advice, which is to just outlast people. Which is awful. But then his other thing was, I guess it\u2019s called the Ben Franklin effect or the Ben Franklin method. Which is, Benjamin Franklin, there was someone I guess at one point in Congress he didn\u2019t get along with, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">and Ben Franklin hated this guy because he was a jerk, and so Franklin decided that the way to win this guy over was to ask the jerk for a book that Franklin really wanted to read, so ask to borrow the book, return the book with a note, \u201cThis was such a great book! Thank you so much for doing me the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">favor of lending me this book, it was so awesome, blah blah blah\u201d. And then after that, he won over this person. And I told him, \u201cI know where this is going\u201d, but my dad, the sort of idea that my dad was going with, which is that if there\u2019s someone that you have conflict, that you\u2019re sort of thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200493\">about your conflict with, what you want to do is put them in a position where you kind of manifest them doing something nice for you, and then you compliment them. \u201cThat was so great that you were nice to me\u201d, or \u201cThank you so much for your notes on whatever\u201d and through this, people like being complimented, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200494\">people like doing something useful so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: They like being appreciated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes. And while it\u2019s like a totally interesting idea, I feel like a I still don\u2019t feel the root of the problem is communication. Or my lack my inability to communicate. Which I did, I told my dad, like, fundamentally I can\u2019t communicate around there\u2019s no way for me to communicate around <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">Berto\u2019s racism or sexism. They can\u2019t hear me in that... I just got stopped, there\u2019s nothing really to do. He didn\u2019t respond to that, but we did talk a little bit about, I don\u2019t know if the word is diplomacy or other things. My dad\u2019s worked for [inaudible] since 1980. He worked for [inaudible] for like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">25 years. He was in academia briefly before that as a professor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: A chemistry professor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. And he left academia because he disliked politics. Grrr, dad! We\u2019ve also already talked about how we both hate the same kind of politics, and doing this, you would think I would hate that. But, like, I don\u2019t think my dad gets the extent to which there\u2019s really no pressure for someone who\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">if you\u2019re not a great manager, but you\u2019re not horrible, there\u2019s no pressure to make you leave. No one says, sales are down in the music library department. There\u2019s nothing. And there\u2019s no so if you are moderately competent enough to show up to meetings, you are just going to get into position and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">then you\u2019ll be there until you retire. I\u2019m speaking broadly, but that\u2019s what happens that\u2019s why people like university jobs. [inaudible] retirement. He\u2019s working in a four-product environment, where if someone was really incompetent, you\u2019d be like \u201cMeh. Your department efficiency, whatever whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200533\">whatever\u201d. And that just doesn\u2019t exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562030\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: I guess I felt like my dad was sort of operating under the idea that this was a ... if the workplace isn\u2019t an essentially ... not a little guilt but like... you\u2019re not the invisible hand while you knock the economy. I think in his head, there\u2019s some kind of ... the invisible hand of merit will...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: I see.

I can rephrase, I can try, I can you know, whatever I\u2019ve done, but in the end, there\u2019s A) the communication problem is my fault in the end, and B) there\u2019s only so many ways you can ask someone for work. There are very few. I understand it\u2019s completely irrational and crazy, and doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">make any sense that this would be happening, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: That only makes it so much more frustrating.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: \u201cThat you clearly haven\u2019t thought of and tried\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I just did that. One thing that was funny is that, I was talking to my dad more generally, and he was like, \u201cWell people probably know that you don\u2019t like your manager\u201d. I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, sort of\u201d. I try not to express that generally. People often say to me, \u201cOh, you must love having Chet as <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">your manager, Karl as your building head, or whatever\u201d. And I\u2019m like, \u201cNope!\u201d I usually just don\u2019t answer. But if someone presses then I\u2019ll answer. My dad was like \u201cReally? They don\u2019t know how you feel?\u201d Okay. Fine. Which is true, like, I\u2019m sure that in our department all-staff meetings, I\u2019ve kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">given up on pretending that I\u2019m not frustrated, but our all-staff meetings are actually not that many people. And I don\u2019t know. I guess I hope that I don\u2019t actually want to broadcast my rage and content across the entire library. That would be bad. And unprofessional. And also just not good. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200733\">my dad is right that yes, certainly some people have noticed. Probably managers notice that I\u2019m not thrilled. I mean you\u2019d have to. But, the not entirely helpful response in my head is basically like, well, I try really hard to be diplomatic, but at this point, fuck. Which is I sometimes think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200734\">like, if I\u2019m capable of being diplomatic and like sucking it up or whatever, and if someone\u2019s behavior shoves me over the edge, part of me is like, \u201cWell, you deserve it. Because Jesus Christ\u201d. The level it would have to be to try and get to the level you have to get me to, like, vocally, at work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200735\">tell someone off, it\u2019s pretty intense. But, that\u2019s a totally fine rationalization for me, but it doesn\u2019t... , Karl and Chet are still in positions of power, and bleh. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562030\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right. I mean, the only pieces that I start to wonder about, and this is probably the same as everybody else, there\u2019s a partial, mild aspect of, did you set your dad up a little bit in the following way? In fact you\u2019ve been frustrated over thinking about, struggling with this for years with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">Chet, and have tried many different things. Are completely exasperated. And, you know, think he\u2019s a terrible manager for twelve different reasons, as well as, and you haven\u2019t talked too much explicitly about this, I mean you\u2019ve alluded to it today and other times, his sexism and racism, which also contribute <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">to things that make him hard to deal with. That all seems like, to me, in a quite relevant context, the question of, \u201cHey, I asked my manager for work, he didn\u2019t give me any. What do you think I should do\u201d. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s stuff your dad already knows. But I guess with your dad kind of, unlike your mom. I\u2019m not surprised to hear you say your mom has a question about Wellbutrin, like... but the story you were telling your dad, if he knew all that stuff, maybe he\u2019d suggest the Ben Franklin <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">thing, but he wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s just a communication problem\u201d. Maybe he would, but I don\u2019t know, it seems to me like there\u2019s a lot of, sort of, amount of time, amount of effort, erroneous sense of beating your head against the wall, the various criticisms of Chet that you have, which are well-earned <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B2\">by Chet, that he doesn\u2019t know and that I imagine make his responses seem both sillier and more maddening to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Sort of. I have, it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t want to do advice unless really explicitly asked. Like, really explicitly. So I have asked him about dealing with racism at work. And his response was, by leaving them out, and to try harder, and that kind of thing. I was not surprised that he said I left <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">them out, I mean kind of what I...I kind of set him not exactly, I don\u2019t know. I kind of set him up. I also kind of want him to be like, \u201cThat really sucks\u201d, or offer some educated perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t imagine you expected him to have a solution for you. I imagine you wanted him to be sympathetic, that like, they drive you nuts, and especially for somebody who, A) he\u2019s your dad, and B) he knows the workplace, he\u2019s an HR person, like, yeah, if he said \u201cA horrible manager really can <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">make a job miserable\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: I mean I think in the end, he, I think he really believes that if I had asked Chet in the right way, that he would have been like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s whatever\u201d. I\u2019ve talked to him about it. I\u2019ve told him various trusted details.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562030\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: That makes sense to me, given what you\u2019ve said before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. His...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I imagine it feels to you like a kind of fantasy he has that if you handle it right, if you communicate right or if you\u2019re sort of strategic or understand the situation well enough, that you won\u2019t run into problems like that. I imagine it feels sort of like a kind of denial that he does about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">other things too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like, I think, the main messages my dad is giving me about dealing with racism either in the workplace or in my personal life is, like, you know, stay calm. Use the right, nice voice. Don\u2019t sound like an angry black person. Sound like a nice person. If you just phrase it right and stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">cool and whatever, then the problem will go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: I see. Not like, you may be terribly vulnerable in the workplace, and sometimes handling it in a certain way will help. Other times it won\u2019t make a damn bit of difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. I also think that he believes that if there really was a problem, that HR would respond. And since they haven\u2019t, that means there\u2019s not really a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: I see. I wasn\u2019t aware that\u2019s how it worked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] the way that, your entirely vulnerable position with Chet and ... you feel like people kind of want to look the other way from that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t, I mean, I think, given what I think it my dad does not want, having done whatever activism, sacrifice, et cetera et cetera, he does not want Will and I to be in a world where we\u2019re still suffering racial prejudice at work or school or wherever. Which, sure, but that\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">but happening. But he very he\u2019s very invested in that. Which for me, I think adds to the vulnerability of being in that particular work situation because I feel like I\u2019ve the coping skills my dad taught me aren\u2019t actually helpful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: And in some ways they can be almost self-destructive. And so that frustrates me a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Where do you have his support? I mean. You\u2019re saying the skills he gave you don\u2019t work, and probably backfire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think he thinks he\u2019s being supportive, but I think basically he\u2019s just like, \u201cWell, obviously it\u2019s not a real problem, or it\u2019s not a really big problem, because if it was, these other things would be happening.\u201d So, yeah, him telling me \u201cYou\u2019ve expressed frustrations with a lot of managers <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">in the past\u201d. I was kind of like, \u201cYes, in really horrible experiences that, like, I don\u2019t know\u201d. I felt like he was saying I\u2019m an argumentative, recalcitrant employee. Which I don\u2019t think I am. Usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: That seems like it was quite a hurtful conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. He actually did ask me if I was upset. If, or like he said at the beginning, like, \u201cThis might hurt your feelings but I think the problem is you\u2019re not diplomatic enough and that sort of thing.\u201d And it was nice that he was kind of aware that this might hurt my feelings, but I think the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">part that hurt my feelings isn\u2019t that, like, oh you\u2019re right, I am, I don\u2019t know, I am too [inaudible] or I am too whatever. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s a behavior happening that I don\u2019t want to admit to. It\u2019s more like he won\u2019t I just feel like he doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not, he started talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD2\">it almost as if I had a personal failing, which it\u2019s, not a personal failing, it\u2019s an institutional failing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562030\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Originally you\u2019re feeling really vulnerable, upset, and frustrated about something, and he\u2019s not being supportive about that, and also telling you it\u2019s your fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Part of the thing with the Ben Franklin story is, part of me thought like, \u201cOh right, you worked in business\u201d. Where, there are books. The Blah Method and the Blah Method and the 360 Eval whatever. But also, it was very much the \u201cWell here\u2019s the solution you didn\u2019t think of.\u201d I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">like \u201cI actually did think of trying diplomacy, and that didn\u2019t work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] for me about this is like, you\u2019re his daughter, and he\u2019s saying you failed to be diplomatic? You know what I mean? I know he\u2019s not sitting next to you at work, but, you talk to a lot of people and say lots of things. And his saying that he thinks you\u2019re not good at communicating <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B51\">without giving examples of things he\u2019s seen first-hand or that he imagines you\u2019re not diplomatic without explaining why he thinks that based on his own sense of you, I don\u2019t know. I guess makes, I imagine could feel like he\u2019s disconnected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes. I think that\u2019s... yeah. Part of why it was really bothering me is I definitely have a sense of myself as being able to communicate well. It was upsetting to have my dad be like, \u201cNope. That thing you think you\u2019re good at, you\u2019re not.\u201d When I think about things I\u2019m good at doing in a workplace, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">that\u2019s definitely one of them. One of the big ones I think. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I can communicate in the right way\u201d blah blah blah. I have [inaudible] people. And yeah. I\u2019m just kind of like, I don\u2019t know, I went to Cambridge and got an Honors degree in Humanities. I know how to write an essay. I can [inaudible]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B72\">I think that\u2019s what you spent a lot of money for me to learn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You guys have sat at the dinner table probably plenty of times; do you come across as somebody who has trouble communicating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

The only thing that I don\u2019t do very well is public speaking. My dad\u2019s a really great public speaker. Yeah, it\u2019s really weird, because it\u2019s very much a ... to me, I\u2019m like, that\u2019s not my dad. That\u2019s someone else who isn\u2019t in any like, there\u2019s a public speaker persona, sort of. Yeah. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">just kind of like a work, shmoozing persona. I mean, it\u2019s still him, but it\u2019s very like, \u201cWhat just happened\u201d. He\u2019s really gregarious, and working the room and all these things, and it\u2019s just kind of weird to me. I get stage fright and he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m kind of like, all right. You know? I think I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C52\">like he\u2019s seen me communicate in basically all the ways except trying to do public speaking and most other people say that I\u2019m better at it than I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: At public speaking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Which I can accept, maybe. I don\u2019t know. I just get so nervous about it. But also it kind of feels like he ... sort of in this like, if there\u2019s two sides, me and Chet, or management, I feel like he\u2019s kind of picking not my side, which feels horrible and really weird. And it\u2019s really discouraging <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">in terms of just, I try to think about how they\u2019re working hard, and other places are different, and other... but... Like, my dad. A) My dad, and B) A person with a very different HR perspective having both these people be like, \u201cNo, the problem is you\u201d. It just makes me feel that this is a problem <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF2\">that\u2019s just not... that it\u2019s going to drive me crazy until I retire or, I don\u2019t know, get a MacArthur grant. Which doesn\u2019t really it does not make me feel great about career prospects or anything, because... I\u2019ve been having this very much, the last four months, why am I going to library school, why <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF3\">am I spending all this money and time on this since I\u2019m not going to get ahead anyway, blah blah blah. And that feels like it\u2019s just sort of another confirmation that I\u2019m not going to succeed and that changing institutions, changing coasts, changing whatever, having a professional degree won\u2019t help.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562030\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">[PAUSE 00:44:03 00:44:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">I mean, the other aspect someone I know asked me to contribute to a panel she\u2019s proposing at a library conference in March I think.

Sort of conceptually, she\u2019s learned all these, like, making zines for ten years, in a way ended up being a form of professional development, because she knows how to XYZ. It\u2019s true that all my information about accessibility comes from my spare time, so, I think a really good idea would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D32\">be like, yeah.
