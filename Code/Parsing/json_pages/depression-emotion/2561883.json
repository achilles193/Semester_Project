I\u2019m still a little stressed because I haven\u2019t really done much yet to unpack in my new place; and then it turns out that a bunch of packages have been getting stolen from the front area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: At the new place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: At the new place. I signed up for the special UPS stuff. Most of what Amazon ships, they ship through UPS and most of what I\u2019m getting online is usually through Amazon, so this way I can schedule the date and a two-hour delivery window and stuff. I did lose one package that wasn\u2019t really very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">valuable.  The other ones I intercepted and had them go to the UPS store, but then I guess they got delivered today because all of a sudden there were these huge boxes for me at my place, so it was good that I went there to start unloading and I have all this kitchen stuff in the car that I have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">unload. There\u2019s not much counter space in the kitchen and all the boxes are still in the living room. I need to get through them to be able to actually live in the place. It seems like it will take another week and a half. I haven\u2019t gotten Tiberius yet because I want the place more set up before I get him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: That makes sense to want to have some things settled and out of boxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: And then I was going to get the visitor parking pass today because we had all this time before therapy, except that I could not find a single place to park.  There are all these 30-minute spots and they were all taken, which seems really odd with 30-minute spots, but I guess everybody had the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">same thought that I did or something to go to the parking office today. Usually it\u2019s not that crowded, so I have to try again after therapy. I guess the thing is all these little things \u2013 I just can\u2019t ever relax. I feel like I can\u2019t relax until I get all these things done. The other thing is that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">just keep on going through this thing \u2013 not today, but the last few days where I keep thinking that life isn\u2019t worth living and all this stuff is too hard. I don\u2019t really know how to stop doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: What happens when you start to think that? What\u2019s the process that you go through? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I start thinking, \u201cOh, no. I have to do all these things. It\u2019s going to be really hard.\u201d I don\u2019t know \u2013 or that I can\u2019t handle the stress and then it goes to, \u201cI don\u2019t have to do these things. I\u2019d be better off if I were dead; then I wouldn\u2019t have to do all these things.\u201d It usually doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">get a lot farther than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So what happens after that if it doesn\u2019t go further? What does happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good question because I don\u2019t know. I guess something happens because if I\u2019m saying these thoughts out loud, it usually turns into a bit of a disagreement with Sydney where he\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t think like that,\u201d and then I have to reassure him and then I get sidetracked because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">it will make him panic if I get too negative and then I get sort of annoyed that I have to be caring about his emotions when my emotions are the ones that are really hard right now.  Why can\u2019t I just be? It\u2019s just like then having to be there for him to not be so sad and not say anything, even if I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">made the suggestion that if we didn\u2019t spend as much time together? He\u2019s like no, he wants to spend as much time together as we do; but I\u2019m like it can\u2019t always be like this. I can\u2019t always be happy. The real me will come out and he\u2019s like \u201cthat\u2019s okay.\u201d But then it clearly isn\u2019t okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: I wonder if there is allowance to feel frustrated or overwhelmed. What you\u2019re feeling is overwhelmed. There are all these things that I have to do and I\u2019m not sure I can really do them. It sounds to me like that\u2019s a feeling of being overwhelmed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Is there a difference between saying that you want to end your life and expressing your feeling of being overwhelmed, frustrated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s just that the two go together so often that it becomes the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Is he okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: He would probably be okay with me saying I\u2019m overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if maybe that\u2019s something to work on for both of you because one of the things it sounds like you\u2019re wanting is some space and some emotional support from him, a space where you get to be how you really feel. You don\u2019t feel happy all the time and you want some support from him in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">caring for your feelings. It sounds like that\u2019s one of the things that you\u2019re wanting. And when you say, \u201cLife isn\u2019t worth living. I might as well kill myself,\u201d he can\u2019t handle hearing that.  But maybe you could get one of the things that you want from him if you were able to phrase it in a way that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">more comfortable for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s how I feel. At the time, it doesn\u2019t register as overwhelmed. It registers as wanting to kill myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s part of your work, being able to register it as what its feeling is, rather than a statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: He gets better able to handle it, but he still doesn\u2019t like it when I panic, even if I\u2019m not going to a point where I feel suicidal. So maybe I can\u2019t just say that I\u2019m overwhelmed because it might be too much. I guess it depends on my tone of voice and how I sound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: How extreme you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I think setting Sydney\u2019s reaction aside, I think it\u2019s an important skill for you to practice because one of the things that is happening is that you are limiting the language that you give yourself to express yourself.  So anything \u2013 from being panicked to being sad to feeling hopeless to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">feeling overwhelmed \u2013 there are all these different feelings that you have that are getting lumped into \u201cI\u2019m feeling suicidal.\u201d I think you actually have a broader range than what your language is allowing you to express.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Maybe, but they sort of all start feeling the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they do. They blend into each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I am aware that there is more language to express these different feelings if they were, in fact, different feelings, but they end up as the same feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: They end up in the feeling of \u201cI just don\u2019t want to deal with any of it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: So what if you said that? Because there seems to be a difference to me between not wanting to face the hard parts of life and wanting to kill yourself. I know that, in some ways, they\u2019re the same, but I think that there is also a slight difference in the motivation. I think your motivation <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">is to want to avoid the pain. Certainly, not living is one way to avoid pain, but it seems like you want to live, just not with any of that pain, not with any of that frustration that some of those tasks have.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: There is no way to escape it though, otherwise. I will have to face it sooner or later; and if I don\u2019t want to, then I really don\u2019t want to. Just saying I don\u2019t want to face it, I don\u2019t know what that would solve because then if I\u2019m at that stage that I need to figure out a solution how I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">get away with not feeling this pain, then that\u2019s the only solution I can think of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Is it not wanting to feel it or not thinking you can handle it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Probably not thinking I can handle it. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I know. These are hard things to tease apart because they do all start to feel very connected, but I\u2019m pressing you because I think teasing them apart is a way to make it more manageable. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) I guess it mostly feels like I can\u2019t handle it and I\u2019ve dealt with so much stress already, too stressed to handle more stress of doing more thing.  I just want to be able to relax and I can\u2019t because it\u2019s always something or something else. Now I have to unpack my place <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">and that\u2019s going to take forever. Until then, I\u2019m still living out of Sydney\u2019s place and I can\u2019t keep on doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to unpack your place if you\u2019re not in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: He doesn\u2019t want me to go off and do it by myself. This morning it took forever to get out of the house because he was tired and depressed and whatever and it took him forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: And you couldn\u2019t leave without him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, I asked him, \u201cCan\u2019t I go? Would it be okay if I did it by myself?\u201d He wanted to come with me and I was like, \u201cOkay, then you need to go faster.\u201d In the end we were able to take some of the stuff in, but we weren\u2019t able to do a lot; so there is still all this other stuff needs go to the house. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I feel like he\u2019s sort of weighing me down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like he\u2019s definitely slowed you down today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: He\u2019s like, \u201cthis is as fast as I can go.\u201d That makes no sense. Part of the time we were waiting for the movers because one of his roommates is moving out today. But even then, there was still all this other time that I was just waiting and waiting and waiting. He had to relax. He had to go on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">the Internet and stuff before we left the house, which is sort of the way it always is. Then it\u2019s like one more stressor that I don\u2019t have control over my schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: You sound angry at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I\u2019m a little mad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: A little mad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I could try not to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to try not to be in here. You\u2019re allowed to be a little mad at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: In theory,) I don\u2019t even know. If it\u2019s all due to his depression, then it\u2019s not his fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Then you can be mad at the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: There\u2019s nothing I can do to fix that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Even when you\u2019re depressed you still have some control over the choices you make. So if \u2013 and I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never sat with him. I\u2019ve never talked with him, obviously. So not necessarily about him, but just talking about people\u2019s responses to depression, yes, it\u2019s possible that one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">the symptoms of depression is feeling very lethargic and being slowed. So say that that\u2019s due to the depression, his choice to say, \u201cThis is the pace at which I\u2019m moving. You want to go to your apartment and unpack things, but you can\u2019t go without me. You have to wait for me,\u201d that\u2019s his choice.  He <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">has agency over being able to give you the option of \u201cI\u2019d like to go with you, but you can go on your own because I can\u2019t go faster than this.\u201d You also have the agency to decide what is the choice that you want to make. Do you want to go on your own without him because you want to go then? Or do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200713\">want to get less done and wait for him? You\u2019re allowed to make that choice, as is he.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I guess part of it is, like today, sometimes it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t want me to go because he knows I\u2019m going to get angry, having to do it without him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: You were angry anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. Last week he was going to help me come over because I was starting to get really panicked the night before. The thought of going to the house was really scary and I didn\u2019t want to go by myself, even though I was like, \u201cOkay, I can probably handle the packing.\u201d  What I ended up doing because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">Sydney couldn\u2019t come with me was calling Aimee and she came with me, but I can\u2019t really have my friend do all this day-to-day stuff. I guess I could. It would take forever, but I could unload the cart by myself. Some of the boxes I can do by myself, like in the house, because there are two rooms in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200772\">the apartment. There is the bedroom and then there is the living room. All the boxes are currently all packed up and stacked in the living room. Some of the ones I want to get to are underneath some of the ones that are really heavy, so it feels more like a two-person job than a one-person job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Some of it might be a two-person job, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all of it needs to wait for two people. It\u2019s seeing where you have choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: If the boxes I need are all underneath the boxes that I can\u2019t move, then that sort of stops me in the middle of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Or it leaves you doing things in not the order that you necessarily want to do it in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: But if I want to be able to live there I need my toiletries. If those are in a box that\u2019s way underneath everything else \u2013 okay, I might be able to unpack some other things but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t get to those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, those are the ones that are important to be able to live there. I hate unpacking. I wish I could have more help, but I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s appropriate to ask my friends to help me unpack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: You can certainly ask and they can choose whether or not it\u2019s something they can help with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to put them in an awkward situation if it\u2019s the kind of thing that\u2019s socially unacceptable to ask about and I just somehow missed that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: How would you feel if somebody asked you? If Aimee was moving and said, \u201cCan you come help me unpack one night?\u201d would that feel like an imposition or burden?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I guess it would depend on how busy I was, but feels like it\u2019s not the most ridiculous thing in the world, but yeah, I don\u2019 t know. I guess if you can have friends help you pack, you can have friends help you unpack. I don\u2019t want to ask Aimee since I already asked her to help me pack. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: How would it feel to ask your mom to come help on a weekend? Would she do that or would you be comfortable with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m afraid that she\u2019ll say no, so I\u2019d rather not. The thing is my mom has to drive for an hour to get up to New Haven, so there it\u2019s like asking for too much.  (voice breaking) When I was asking for help because I was going crazy, Aimee was finding the movers. I asked my parents to help me with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">that because I felt like I couldn\u2019t handle it. I told them I was stressed, but I never told them that I was suicidal. They ended up telling me, \u201cYou\u2019re almost 30. You should be able to do this all by yourself. We get stressed, too.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell them that I was suicidal so I ended up luckily <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F2\">being able to have the movers come on the day that I wanted them because it wasn\u2019t scheduling the movers that was so scary, it was the idea that I was going to have to call different ones and see how much it costs for storage because I was going to have to move in two days.  That was hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Imagining that the first call wasn\u2019t going to be enough and imagining all the calls after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: It was the whole having to look online and some people didn\u2019t have their rates online for storage. (sighs) All that \u2013 or not knowing how big of a storage space I need. So I was like okay, fine, if I call and the first one that says yes, they can do it. Even if it ends up being more money I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">just going to do that. If my parents wanted me to spend less money, I didn\u2019t have the sanity to spend less money and call around to other people. When I was able to hire movers for the day that I wanted, that was all avoided, but just because that happened I don\u2019t feel I can really ask my mom to help <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">me unpack. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: It sounds like that\u2019s part of what\u2019s really increasing your stress about this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: (crying) I was really wanting to kill myself because I figured that was going to be the easiest way to deal with the movers. Then I wouldn\u2019t have had to deal with them, but I couldn\u2019t tell my parents that. Really, there is no way to tell your parents, \u201cOh, by the way, I want to kill myself.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">I don\u2019t want to threaten suicide but . . . (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Is that what it feels like you\u2019re doing when you tell that to Sydney or tell that to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: No. Sometimes he tells me that I\u2019m threatening suicide and it\u2019s usually in the middle of a fight and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing. Maybe I am. I think I\u2019m just suicidal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the difference for you in threatening suicide and planning suicide?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I guess threatening is like \u201cdo X or I\u2019ll kill myself.\u201d I think it\u2019s more like all this craziness is getting me to the point of wanting to kill myself. I can\u2019t deal with all the stuff that\u2019s going on right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: The next question is: What\u2019s the line between wanting to kill yourself and planning to actually do it? Where are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: I\u2019m probably on the side of wanting to. The thing is, I still couldn\u2019t plan . . . It wouldn\u2019t take that much for me to plan to kill myself. I just never actually did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s the intentionality, I think, that maybe . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019ve never . . . I mean I\u2019ve sometimes even held the Desipramine and thought about it, but I\u2019ve never really actually done it because I could never make myself do it when I was feeling bad, even though I was feeling really bad.

I still have to do all these things. That\u2019s the other thing, my parents . . . Maybe I should just tell them that I don\u2019t want the table because in order to get the table in my car I would have to clean out the car. But there is all this stuff in the car that isn\u2019t trash; it\u2019s stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">that we need, but it\u2019s been in the car for a really long time. I sort of just want to order a folding table online, except that I can\u2019t do that unless I know that someone is going to be home since the whole things getting stolen out of the front hallway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it would feel easier to set a time with your parents, rather than feeling like you have to rush to clean out the car to get the table \u2013 taking some control of the situation and setting a timeline that works for you, rather than one that feels like pressure to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s all going to feel like pressure, unless it\u2019s like I\u2019ll get the table when I\u2019m done cleaning out the car, whenever that is. The problem is that I need a table. I can\u2019t really eat at my new place without having one. I guess I could order new folding chairs, too, instead of getting the ones <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">from Connecticut because it does seem like it would be a pain to clean out the car enough to get those. It seems like it would be easier just to buy new ones for now. All this stuff in the car, there is so much. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s all there.  We had a pop-up [sooka] (ph?) that broke and that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B32\">in the car because it was at my place and so I had to get it out. We ended up getting rid of it because it was broken and because we had no place for it, so we got rid of that at my parents\u2019 place. I thought that would free up a lot of space. There were some jackets that my mom had given me and I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B33\">since gotten a new jacket and had to give those back to her. I thought that would also free up a lot of space, but then in the end it wasn\u2019t really enough space that the table would have fit; also because we have all the pots and pans, so I don\u2019t even know if it would be possible in a day to clean out <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B34\">the car enough that I could get the table. But it would need to be a day that me and Sydney could both work on it because it\u2019s both of ours stuff. That day hasn\u2019t happened yet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard when you have to also wait for him and for your own sense of feeling capable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Usually I can force myself to do it. If he would be up for it, I would be up for it, too, but the part of tackling it by myself is the part that gets me more overwhelmed and if I have someone helping me it\u2019s not as bad. I just feel like I\u2019m asking my friends too much and if I ask them to help <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">unpack, then am I going to ask them to clean out the car and just rely on my friends to do everything? That doesn\u2019t seem right.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Are these things that you feel like you were more capable of in the past?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. The thing about cleaning out the car is that it requires long arms to reach over things, I feel like. And also it doesn\u2019t help that there are snowbanks on the side of the road. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It certainly does make it more challenging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: So it doesn\u2019t seem like it would be something I could easily do by myself anyways \u2013 the same with the pots; so I don\u2019t know if I would have been able to do that. The unpacking, I think if I had more space I would be able to do it myself if it wasn\u2019t all these huge stacks. I also have an Ikea <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF1\">bookshelf that I need to build and I think that\u2019s a two-person job, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it would feel helpful to make lists of what things you feel like you can do on your own \u2013 it might be easier with two people \u2013 but that you are capable of; and which things are things that you really need help with, either because they\u2019re too heavy or because you need somebody <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C11\">with longer arms or a taller body to step over the snowbanks until they melt, something that you really do need help for because you\u2019re not physically capable of it.  You can see where are the things that I can make movement and have control over on my own? Where are the things that I really am dependent <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C12\">on somebody else\u2019s help? It sounds like part of what\u2019s feeling so overwhelming is that there is a lot to do \u2013 some of which you can do on your own; some of which you can\u2019t, but it all gets lumped into this giant category of a ton of stuff I have to do and I don\u2019t have any help with and I can\u2019t do by <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C13\">myself, which is really overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: The problem is some of the things that I might otherwise be able to do by myself hinge on other things, like if I need to go to the grocery store I could do that by myself, except there is no space in the car to put the groceries. I would need someone to help me clean out the car somewhat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Somewhat \u2013 so there may be some things. So if you just need enough space for a grocery run, that\u2019s different than needing enough space for a table. Let yourself separate it out because this is exactly what happens.  Suddenly you feel like you\u2019re incapable of anything because you\u2019re lumping <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">things together and connecting things that don\u2019t necessarily really need to be connected. You said there has been stuff in the car for a long time. You\u2019ve made grocery trips since then. That\u2019s not a thing you\u2019re not capable of. You may not be capable of moving some of the heavy boxes. You are capable <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C52\">of going to the grocery store. If you need to make some room, then I bet there are some things in that car that you can move on your own to make enough room for a grocery bag or two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: It just seems a little bit ridiculous because I have so many different boxes that have pots in them that I have to go back and make a trip for each one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It might not be the most efficient, but it\u2019s better than doing nothing and feeling like you\u2019re thwarted from it all. Because when you start to feel so pinned down and that you can\u2019t do anything because you can\u2019t do it the way you want or the way that might make the most sense, it leaves you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">less able and less in control.  Instead of thinking about the things that you can\u2019t do or the ways that it\u2019s not the way you want it, making a list of the things that you very well can do will give you some space to make movement. I think that you\u2019ll find there is actually some real progress you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C92\">make when you look at what it is you can do on your own and have some progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">CLIENT: It just feels like there is so much stuff in the car that needs to get out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: That might be true, but it\u2019s also true that you can do some of it and make some progress, even with it not being the conditions to get it all done. They don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive. It sounds like there is a ton of stuff in the car.  There are lots of boxes that you might not be able <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">to get to, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do anything. In the past, when you\u2019ve been able to be active and take steps towards your goal, that felt better than feeling prohibited from doing anything. You have a lot of experience packing and moving and unpacking. I know more than you want recently, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD2\">if you look at the process that you went through last time and the time before that, you can learn from what made you feel better and what made you feel worse to do the things that made you feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve never had this little space to unpack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s also all your own space so it\u2019s a little bit different because in the other places you were trying to fit your stuff into your room, but there were common areas to work in.  Now you don\u2019t need to worry about the common space that you\u2019re taking up, but there is a little bit less room <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D11\">to maneuver \u2013 or maybe a lot less room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">CLIENT: A lot less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a different scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s too late now, but I wish I could have labeled everything better.

Carry a small load from wherever you park and bring in one thing with you. That\u2019s not a ton of progress, it\u2019s not doing everything you need to do, but if you\u2019re going to go from the car to the house one time, pick one thing that you can carry in and you will have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">done that one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s also that I would be going over to Sydney\u2019s place because that\u2019s where Sydney would be and that\u2019s where we could eat since I don\u2019t have the kitchen set up.

Your choice would be to maybe work a little bit less, take the extra time to drive from one place to the next and get a little bit done.  The other choice you have is to maybe work a little bit longer and not do something <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F12\">on the apartment, but make up financially for some of the time at work that you missed. You\u2019re not prohibited. You have two choices and maybe more; but those are the two clear ones that I see. Let yourself make a choice about which feels better to you. Neither one is perfect, but which one feels better <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F13\">for you? What is going to let you feel like you\u2019re being active?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: Probably working more because I think it would just be frustrating to only be able to unload a tiny little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Okay, so then do the thing that feels better, but know that you\u2019re making the choice. Rather than feeling like you\u2019re being passive and your life is being dictated to you, you\u2019re actively seeking \u201cI\u2019m going to invest in working and making a little bit more money.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: This whole situation is also compounded by the fact that on Wednesday, the lights that light up the dashboard went out. Apparently that\u2019s something because when my dad looked at the fuse didn\u2019t think it was the fuse, but if it was a light bulb you\u2019d have to take out the whole front panel or <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">something really ridiculous like that; but it\u2019s a whole day thing. Then I have to empty things out of the car before I would drop it off at the mechanic because I don\u2019t want my stuff to get stolen. Then, if it isn\u2019t just a quick fix, the only day I was going to be able to do that would be today or Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">Now when I drive back from work this week \u2013 I can\u2019t take another week off from work. (voice breaking) I missed the last two weeks from work. But if I do go to work, driving home in the dark is going to be \u2013 like when I drove to Connecticut it was really, really scary because I couldn\u2019t see the speedometer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F91\"> I guess I could just pace with traffic and that\u2019s what I ended up doing, but that\u2019s still a little scary. I\u2019ll be doing that alone and I\u2019ll be doing that three days this week. I guess when I stayed at Connecticut it\u2019s sad that it wouldn\u2019t be as long and maybe I should stay away and do that instead. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F92\">I don\u2019t know because it\u2019s going to be an all-day thing to fix the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">When I talked to the mechanic I was going to try to get it in on Friday. When I was in Connecticut Wednesday night to Sunday, the mechanic was the one who told me you have to be able to take out the whole front thing in order to be able to do it and he wouldn\u2019t have been able to see it until today. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB1\">So I said I\u2019d take it to a place in New Haven.  That ended up not happening because of the late start. I was like okay, I guess I\u2019ll take the car in on Friday, but now I have to do the really scary driving this week and maybe I should just take off from work. (crying) I\u2019ve already missed two weeks of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB2\">work. I don\u2019t want to miss three weeks of work in a row, even if some of them were me planning to be off ahead of time. (sobbing) I imagine I wasn\u2019t the only person who took Thursday off of work because of all the snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200FA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: I used the time to prepare for the blizzard and they were actually closed on Friday, so even if I wanted to go in and work for a little bit that day I wouldn\u2019t have been able to.  No one was in on Wednesday, either, so I only missed two working days of work and one non-working day. It\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF1\">all too much to deal with. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I should ask my parents for help unpacking. I\u2019m just afraid they\u2019re going to say no. I don\u2019t know. Maybe if we went out for Chinese food or something in Hamden it would make it more worth their while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: You could certainly propose that. They would get a working visit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah, just because I have to clean out the car and do all these things that I can\u2019t. Most of the stuff we have in the car isn\u2019t valuable. It\u2019s really all the pots and pans that are, especially since they\u2019re all brand new.  Everything is so locked together that it feels like I can\u2019t do any of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">it myself. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: Pick one priority. It gets it unlocked. What\u2019s one priority to focus on getting done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">CLIENT: Maybe getting my bathroom to a usable state, which would require finding the box of bathroom stuff and then also getting the shower curtain out of the car because I don\u2019t have a shower curtain right now. The carton with the hooks are all inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">THERAPIST: Is that something you can do in the hours remaining this afternoon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">CLIENT: Possibly. I guess if it\u2019s this afternoon then the real priority is getting the parking pass and getting the one package that did end up going to the UPS store, since that package is my Internet.  Sydney is going to stick around and help me get other packages that I can get delivered there. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B1\">would be a lot easier for him if there was Internet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">THERAPIST: That is how I want you to approach the next couple of days, picking one priority that you can take care of. That might be work; that might be one room; it might be the car, but focus on one thing and figure out how to get that one priority done. When you think about all of what you have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D1\">do, you spin from one thing to the next and you look at all the ways in which they\u2019re connected and working against you. When you look at everything, it\u2019s impossible to find a place to start; but if you pick one thing I do believe that you\u2019re capable of approaching it one step at a time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">CLIENT: I would have had the parking pass right now if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that there was nowhere to park.

(sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20115\">THERAPIST: An extra challenge that made it out of your control. (pause) It\u2019s really frustrating when those extra hurdles pop up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20117\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard enough to get everything done already and this one is even harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20119\">THERAPIST: When those hurdles come up, label it as such. Just what you said \u2013 it was hard enough already; this made it even harder. It was an extra hurdle in my way. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on.  It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t do it; it means that it just got harder and you have to move on to plan B, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201191\">for you was \u2013 okay, so you didn\u2019t get the pass before the session. Get it after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011B\">CLIENT: I look at the end of the day and I have nothing done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t jump ahead like that. Right now you\u2019re not in a state to jump ahead like that because when you jump ahead it gets to be too much at once and it feels really overwhelming and that\u2019s not a helpful place for you to go. Focus on one piece at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011F\">CLIENT: Okay, well right now it feels like I\u2019ve gotten nothing done this morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20121\">THERAPIST: Well, you went to therapy. Look at what you did. Maybe it\u2019s not all the things you planned and the reason to be careful about what you\u2019re looking at is because how is it helping you to look at the day and say \u201cI got nothing done?\u201d It doesn\u2019t help you get anything done the next part of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201211\">day or, if it\u2019s the end of the day, saying that to yourself doesn\u2019t get you more ready for the next day. It\u2019s not working for you. It\u2019s working against you. It\u2019s making you feel more overwhelmed. It\u2019s making you feel more angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20123\">CLIENT: It does. [You\u2019re right, it\u2019s accomplishments.] (ph?) The fact that it\u2019s true \u2013 I can\u2019t start thinking, \u201cOh, I totally got all the things done,\u201d because that isn\u2019t true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20125\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re right.

(sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20141\">THERAPIST: If you want to take a break from it, think about it like shutting a window on your computer. Just X out of it for a little bit. It doesn\u2019t mean that those things disappear forever and go away, but you\u2019re allowed to X out of it for a little bit. At worst, it doesn\u2019t make it a bigger problem, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201411\">it just moves it to the side for a little bit and you give yourself a break; and then you pick the one thing that you\u2019re going to return to and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll chip away at it until it gets to a place where it feels manageable and you feel a lot more capable. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20140-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20140-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561883\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20143\">CLIENT: I think the reason that I feel like I can\u2019t relax is because I\u2019m still at Sydney\u2019s place and I\u2019m being there too often and that\u2019s where I am.
