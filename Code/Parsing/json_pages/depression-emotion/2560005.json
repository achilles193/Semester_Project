I walked home from here last Monday, which was fun. About an hour and a half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, to walk... I guess I went a little... but you know what, I went slowly and stopped, picked up a sandwich. But yeah, it's not so bad. I walked from here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: Although I walked from... okay, that's took an hour and a half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">CLIENT: I just kind of took a left after (sp?)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F\">CLIENT: Because eventually... I'll just walk, I'll get to Cole eventually. And I went way out by Main. There's some really nice parts of Georgetown.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. So you walked down Main Street?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20075\">THERAPIST: How far down Main did you go?

It's nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but turned back towards Cole eventually. So yeah, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2007D\">THERAPIST: A lot of people actually like to walk around there because it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2007F\">CLIENT: It's nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20081\">THERAPIST: Homes, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20083\">CLIENT: It's really nice, yeah. So that was good, that was a nice little walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20085\">THERAPIST: Then you... so you cut back, went to Cole, and then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20087\">CLIENT: And then I walked Cole up to Willow, and then Willow to home. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20089\">THERAPIST: How far from Willow are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560005\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: 20 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It's a 20 minute walk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: 20 minute walk, yeah. 25 to 30 for most people.

(Pause) God, it was fast, it was ridiculous. Google Maps was like, yeah, it takes you 22 minutes. But Owen was like, yeah, well, there assuming three-minute mile. You can go faster than that. I'm like, yeah. It was something like ten. It was ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: But my feet were killing me at the end.

Who fucking cares?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, three miles an hour is slow, it's a slow walk.

That's jogging speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Seriously. But I did not. And so... I walked instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I walked down to meet my... it's funny, to meet my drug dealer the other day, down in Georgetown. And (pause) just so great, just so great. [0:04:57] I have always gone through intermediaries. In high school it was Paul (sp?). Paul was always the one who got the weed for us. And then in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A31\">college it was various people. But basically always, almost always...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: It was me sending someone else to get it and coming back with it. I got very uncomfortable (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">THERAPIST: So you don't get pinched or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">CLIENT: That's part of it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\">CLIENT: It's very uncomfortable, drug deals. I was always worried I was going to get stabbed or robbed or police were going to come in or something. And this is in college, these are ridiculous fears to have, at least in the place I was. There was one core drug dealer in town, and his name was Trevor. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF1\">He was a friend of ours. And he just sold weed, but he sold a lot of weed. And he lived within literal throwing distance of the police station. You could just pick up a ball, throw it, ten feet down the driveway and across the street... [0:06:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">THERAPIST: You throw a bag of pot off (ph) (chuckling)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yes. The cops actually (ph) didn't care about weed. They just didn't give a shit. And they liked Trevor, because they're like (pause), this is where the weed comes from. He's like, if something else is going through town, we want to hear about it. And he's like, sure. I'll let you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B7\">CLIENT: He would, and they would deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Is that right? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Western Chicago justice is really interesting. It just kind of gets done without doing a lot of paperwork. Harold cops were the people who'd show up at your house and be like, hey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BF\">CLIENT: This is no good, and you can't be doing this. And people would be like, oh, okay, we'll stop. You're okay, as long as it stops it was not an issue. And, when it doesn't stop and when you're being dicks about it, they come to your house with the fire department to give a safety inspection. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200BF1\">take all your pot plants and smash them on the ground. [0:06:58] And that's what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C1\">THERAPIST: We'll play rough, but only if you're not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, but only if you're not going to be cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C7\">CLIENT: And that's really the entire thing.

Well, I was only there a couple times, the first time to watch South Park, because they got the channel over there we couldn't get in Harold, and the other time to hook up with this girl, which was nice.

I remember the Harold cops (inaudible at 0:08:05) he was smoking weed in the apartment over the summer, a lot of weed in his apartment. And he was playing the stereo really loud, smoking a lot of weed. And someone calls the cops for a noise complaint. Cop's slamming on the door. Kid's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF1\">like, what? It's like, police, open up. He's like, oh fuck, I'm fucked. And he opens the door, and the guy's like, there's a noise complaint? So turn down your stereo a lot. Oh, okay. And he's like, and you should light some fucking incense in here (chuckling), and he just walks off. And he's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF2\">okay, I will. So he started out and got some incense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Within the...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it's like, we don't want to fucking arrest some college kid...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">CLIENT: With this ridiculous (inaudible at 0:08:58). So at the same time on the other side of that coin... so in western Chicago the big issue is criminal vandalism and incest. [0:09:03] Those are the big things that end up breaking down. This is what the sheriff actually... sheriff of the area was telling me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">CLIENT: And couple towns over actually... in terms of the road where Johnson did his whole thing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">THERAPIST: That's that area?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's where...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's the story that was told to me, so if that's wrong then blame my college. But... (Pause) So in any case there was this guy who it was generally understood was hurting children, except (pause) he never... no one ever arrested him for it. [0:10:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">CLIENT: Instead one day they just found him beaten to death in the middle of the street, and nobody had seen a thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">CLIENT: And a cop was quoted as saying, some people just need killing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">THERAPIST: Ah. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">CLIENT: And that was it. That was the end of it. It's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">THERAPIST: But they... so there's almost (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20107\">CLIENT: It was just dealt with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah, somebody watching, though. Somebody doing something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah, right.

He was great. He was like, people come into my courtroom. I'm like, you got this speeding ticket for this much money. He's like, the thing is, too, I don't care. But this much money goes to the state. It's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2010F1\">you're being screwed here. It's like... and he's like, you should fight it on these grounds and try to get it down to something or other, and then we'll deal with that. [0:11:00] And he'd tell people how to get through the system. He's like, this is ridiculous, and here's how you're going to deal with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2010F2\">this the best way possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2010E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560005\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">CLIENT: And other times he'd just be like, you fucked up, and we can't have this. So the slumlord of Harold, quite literally. He would buy the shittiest apartments and then leave them a fucking mess and charge way more than they were worth.

So they'd all have to shell out money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">THERAPIST: So what? He had some influence with the government (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">CLIENT: Well, he just... he really pushed for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">CLIENT: And he did it under the guise of, well, it's just for safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">THERAPIST: It's a political move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And the judge was like... this is...I recommend against this. This is not necessary, what we're doing. And he's more like, I think we can just tell these guys they should put fire escapes on their house, and that can be it. [0:12:08] But people are, no, we want more safety and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201271\">blah blah blah. And he's like, all right. So they got it.

The judge's like, okay, but now we have to look at your places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">CLIENT: And he was like, what, because his places were in violation of his own rules. And for some reason he never thought they'd come to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012F\">CLIENT: And he thought he'd do this whole thing where he's going to screw everyone else...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20133\">CLIENT: Because they all have to pay out more money to fix these things, and he'd be able to...

If there's a problem that you want to solve, the law can be there to be enforced on that. He's like, otherwise we should just ignore it. And he's like, it's not important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014F\">CLIENT: The law is not important.

[0:13:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">THERAPIST: Well, it's a... I think Freud and Lacan talked about that, the importance of that, of... I mean, I think they saw the father as both... in real terms, the real, but also the symbolic enforcer of order, limits boundaries, consequences. And how it's done is very critical to people's (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201551\">(chuckling), well, safety the world? And how I was thinking about it was that, there is no name of the father with your mother. There's nobody able to kind of have some sort of order or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">CLIENT: Well, the order was arbitrary.

[0:14:56] It could be kind of contorted around whatever...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">CLIENT: Whatever fake bullshit some (inaudible at 0:15:03) wrote in the 1800s when they wanted to start a religion so they could fuck children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

And just... well, it's like all scripture, right? You can open any of those books and find a reason to hate people and discriminate and hold yourself superior to others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">CLIENT: It's really easy to do that, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">THERAPIST: That's totally what happens. That's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20167\">CLIENT: So we talk about the church, how little respect you should have for any woman intellectually, where, just across the board, we should all disrespect that actively, to the point where it's almost like, I'm religious.

That's fine. That's what that's for, but don't tell me you believe it, because then I have a problem with you.

And you have to bring it to the church as, God told me this. And there's really one of two ways they can deal with that. [0:16:53] They can be like, great, let's figure out how to make God's word work for us humans, try <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201771\">to implement your idea.

[In the end, you've got] (ph) one thing right. A logical realist talking with a person of faith. [0:17:54] Logical realist can present a logical statement. And the person of faith can then either become a logical realist or continue the conversation.

It's definitely seven days. It says right in the Bible. It's like, clearly it can't be seven days. Could we even accept perhaps it was a metaphor written by first people? Nope, nope, nope. [0:18:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">CLIENT: It is seven days, literally, exactly, it says so in the Bible. So why do you believe that? It says so in the Bible. What evidence exists? The Bible is the evidence.

So [in all that, all messed up] (ph). But the thing about this religion in particular is that you can prove that it's fake. You can pick up the book , and you can be like, this is a lie. And people will say, how? You're like, well, because the grammar was awful until they slowly corrected <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201A31\">it over the years. It was the grammar of a young man who'd never gone to school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">CLIENT: Double negatives, all sorts of crazy bullshit. And people'd be like, oh, well, those were the words he had. It's like, no, that's not what he said. What he said was, he saw each word slowly coalesce in front of him...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Ah. [0:19:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk) and so he saw each one clearly and perfectly. So he said it was a perfect translation. Step one.

And so they go, and God tells <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF1\">them it's okay to kill him, all right, as long as they do so in his sleep. So they kill him in his sleep, steal the books, go back out in the desert where they live.

There weren't many churches there. And he was... didn't know that it was a different religion and everything.

I don't even know which last name she's going by. She... yeah, she was a little funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029D\">THERAPIST: Did you make the call...? Would she tell the church about her...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029F\">CLIENT: Oh, fast and testimony Sunday once a month. You were supposed to fast, and then the next Sunday you would give your testimony.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A3\">CLIENT: Why you know the church is true. It's a little game they make you play as a child. I know the church is true because... literally there's a piece of paper that says, I know the church is true because, dash. [0:31:55] And it's like, you fill in why you know the church is true. And I literally <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202A31\">think sometimes I said, because my teachers tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A5\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A7\">CLIENT: And they didn't like those sorts of answers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A9\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AB\">CLIENT: They wanted me [to say] (ph) because I had a special feeling or because... we want something magical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Oh. Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AF\">CLIENT: Then, so at fast and testimony, people would get up, and they'd give their testimony. And people would roll their eyes when mother would get up there, because they're like, now we're in for it. She's going to speak for 15 to 20 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B3\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. She's giving her testimony on the spot. When the spirit would move her to play the piano, these were some of my favorite times, because, for whatever reason... over the years we just had pianos sometimes. It's like, what's this? This is a piano. How did we get a piano? I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202B31\">I don't know. We have one. [0:32:57] Someone just showed up and put a piano here (chuckling).

She puts her hands on the keys, and she lets her eyes roll back in her head as God moves through her. And she's just like playing stuff, but it's just noise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202C9\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202CB\">CLIENT: And it's discordant and cacophonous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202CF\">CLIENT: And there's this... it's chaos. And she's just like doing this, and she swoops down this end over here. She swoops down, she's hunched over and going crazy like she's seen in movies and whatnot. And she just rocks back and forth playing this sound. [0:33:58] And I think that's when... and no <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202CF1\">one would ever come back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D1\">THERAPIST: Well, the music told the truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D3\">CLIENT: Yes, it did, didn't it? And some people were like, ah. This person is crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D7\">CLIENT: And I think that was one of the few times people were like, ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202DB\">CLIENT: I should go. (Chuckling) It's (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202DD\">THERAPIST: Yes. But otherwise it kind of sanctioned it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202DF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, because... and people'd be like, oh, wow. It's amazing.

And then they knew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F3\">CLIENT: And then they were still just like, oh, she's a little off, and never go back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F5\">THERAPIST: They just didn't want to [look at it] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Of course they didn't want to look at it.

And then after all this she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203271\">fall under these spells. She'd be... because there's so much mess she couldn't move? [0:36:56] And so she'd stumble into the rocking chair in the middle of the room and like, oh, look, if you could just please take those papers over there and stack them neatly and put them in that binder. And put the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203272\">binder on the shelf. Oh, Bridget, if you could please fold those blankets up.

You're creative. You're not smart, you're creative. So use that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2036F1\">That'll be your thing. Your thing'll be you're creative, not that you're smart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20371\">THERAPIST: Well, she was creating her own reality based on her needs, her own narcissistic needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20373\">CLIENT: Yeah, (crosstalk). Yeah, sure. Exactly. Her daughter had to be stupid, but also a whore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20375\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20377\">CLIENT: And... but I remember these were telling things. My kid brother is in this math class, and... [0:41:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20379\">THERAPIST: Well, if she was smart then, she'd be... she'd get wise to all of this. She'd leave the mom. She'd leave her mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2037B\">CLIENT: Sure. She'd figure it out. Right. Which they do, which we all did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2037D\">THERAPIST: Which they... which you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2037F\">CLIENT: We left as soon as we could. As soon as we could each one of us left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20381\">THERAPIST: Yes. She was right (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20383\">CLIENT: And... yeah. And Kevin had no places to go other than to Bridget's for weeks at a time and then Leslie's (sp?) for two years. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20385\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:42:23)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20387\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... but I remember he was in this math class. And he comes back from it, he's like, [ah, huh huh] (sp?). I'm like, okay, so what happened? He was like, uh, we... it was in the class. And there was a problem, and the teacher asked what the answer was. And so I told her. And everyone kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203871\">of looked at me. And they said, how did you do that? (Laughing) And I just said, mentally? [0:42:58] And I'm like... and he's like... so I'm like, because you did it in your head. He's like, yeah. I was like, a lot of people can't do that sort of stuff in their head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20389\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2038B\">CLIENT: He's like, oh, yeah. It's like, a lot of people can't do that. That's why they looked at you that way. I'm like, it's important to remember that you can do things a lot of other people can't do. That's going to be... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2038D\">THERAPIST: What a nice thing to say, for you to say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2038F\">CLIENT: That's going to be a thing. Well, it's truth (laughing), right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20391\">THERAPIST: But man, no one else would have known that except you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20393\">CLIENT: Yeah, but the reason they're amazed at you is because that's amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20395\">THERAPIST: He needed to hear just that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20397\">CLIENT: You can do that sort of math in your head. And he was like, oh. I'm like, yeah. So... and even...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20399\">THERAPIST: It's like you were giving him keys to get out of the cell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2039B\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah. He comes back from work Sunday (ph), and he's like, yeah, so I was standing there. And Benedict... Benedict's (inaudible at 0:43:50) boss, he said to this guy named Kevin... he wanted him to collect carts in the parking lot. [0:44:02] And he says, Kevin. And Kevin didn't say <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2039B1\">anything. So he goes, Kevin. And Kevin didn't say anything. So he turns to me and says, Mike, can you do this thing? And I said, yes sir. And off I went and did it. I was like, that's very good, Mike. That's... people love that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2039D\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2039F\">CLIENT: That's what you should do. When someone at your job says, can you do this thing, you should say yes, and then do it, because they love that. And people will reward that sort of thing. And so my sister the other day, she's complaining about other people reading. And there's things they get wrong. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2039F1\">And she's like, what's the hell? When you're processing an entire sentence at one time, why doesn't...? I'm like, oh, most people can't do that? She's like, what? Yeah, we process sentences... we read and process sentences or parts of paragraphs pretty much instantaneously.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N2039E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2039E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560005\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203A1\">THERAPIST: Mmm. [0:45:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203A3\">CLIENT: And a lot of people don't do that. She's like, well, yeah. A lot of people don't read as well as we do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203A5\">THERAPIST: Ah, uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203A7\">CLIENT: That's just... she's like, oh. I'm like, yeah. That's why we can do these things. And it's surprising. I'm like, that's why you're so good at school, which really shocked her, because she was always told she wasn't, even though she got honor awards and stuff like this and did really well in <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203A71\">her class. Her then-husband and her family... his family would mock her, because they're all pretty dumb. And so they mock intelligence. And she was like, oh, I got this high score on this thing. They're, oh, you think you're so special, you got a high score on the thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203A9\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203AB\">CLIENT: And so they mocked her for years. And so she was like, well, intelligence isn't anything to be proud of. And I'm not smart, I'm creative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203AF\">CLIENT: And it's still only now, where I have to be like... I'm like, yeah, I thought you were stupid for years, too, because that's what we were told. [0:45:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203B1\">THERAPIST: yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203B3\">CLIENT: I was like, but we have to look at this. I'm like, genius parents don't have stupid children. It just doesn't happen. That's not genetically how it works. If both your parents are geniuses, there's a good chance you're also going to be a genius. At least that's how I think it works. That makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203B31\">sense. Is that correct?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there's... I'm sure... I don't know the studies about genetic links of intelligence, but I'm sure, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203B7\">CLIENT: I mean, well, something... there was a study where [they said] (ph) stupid people have stupid children, and intelligent people have smart children. And the more children you have the dumber they're going to get. It was an interesting side effect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203B9\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203BB\">CLIENT: And that's more (inaudible at 0:46:33). Stupid people tend to have more children as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203BD\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Yeah. I think your mother must have been very threatened by intelligence in Bridget and Kevin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203C1\">THERAPIST: She tolerated it in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203C3\">CLIENT: It's so weird... it's just weird ideas.

That's so weird. That's such a great idea, you shouldn't think like that. It's a weird idea. [0:47:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Very threatened or something, scared by it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203CB\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203CD\">THERAPIST: As she was by sexuality in Bridget and in you or Kevin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203CF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, all these things terrified her. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203D0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203D1\">THERAPIST: And she would invoke this idea of religion and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203D2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203D3\">CLIENT: Oh, sure, the devil.

I remember a time when finally all her personalities came together, and she was really her. She was like, oh my God, right now, this is really me. This is the real me right now. It's not any of my other personalities. It's just me. And I remember her being like, Luke, please come hug <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203EF1\">me while I'm me.

It's like, you guys smoking weed in here? Dewey, get back. You don't want this. And he's like, why? Is it addictive? <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2046B1\">It's not habit-forming. You don't want it.
