It's nice out. (Pause) So I was just walking around. I was just thinking about... oops, sorry. I hope that doesn't bother you when I crack... some people get...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I was just thinking about how you were saying... or you said a number of times, it's no longer about... on any particular week or month or whatever, whether I'm depressed or whether I'm feeling anxious or good or... today I was really thinking about that. [0:01:04] I was really kind of sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">with that feeling. And it's absolutely true. I was like, wow, that's why I feel kind of wacky, because when I just stop and just kind of scan how I feel, I don't feel good or bad. I just am, you know what I mean? And I think that's... it's odd. Yeah, it's an odd feeling for me. I noticed a little thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">[that was when] (ph) I stopped at the cafe. This girl came in and was super pretty. And I thought... remember how I've told you before, if I see someone super pretty, whatever, who... especially if they seem like they were kind of my type or whatever, that can... instead of just being like, oh wow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">look at that beautiful girl, it can be a whole... I just feel down and... you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:01:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I noticed how, now, that just doesn't happen. Or even if it does happen it's not part of me. You know what I mean? It just pops up, and it just kind of... it's like, she got her coffee. She smiled, we smiled at each other, she left. And I was like, all right. You know what I mean? I noticed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">that, oh, there's that thing. If I want to go down that road, I can... so it's just interesting how it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: It's less and less egosyntonic. It's less that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Less and less what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Egosyntonic is a word we use for sort of... it's totally consistent with your sense of yourself and encompasses your whole sense of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Wait a second. What's the difference between that and egocentric?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That's not what I mean. There's a very big difference. So egosyntonic means something that just feels like you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Oh, it's a good thing. Or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: It's just consistency with your sense of yourself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I see. [0:02:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: As opposed to egodystonic feels like it's something alien to yourself (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Let's take some notes. Fuck, that's an amazing word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It's a different valence than egocentric. It doesn't have anything to do with being self-centered or... (Pause) Egosyntonic, S Y N.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Oh, S.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: And egodystonic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Huh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: So it's like being... it falls in line and fits right in with your sense of yourself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Got it. Whatever it might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Versus, if you started hallucinating, you might feel like, wait, what's happening to me? This isn't me. This isn't actually happening to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Got it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: it sounds like it's starting to separate a little bit, these kinds of experiences, from feeling like they're just totally you. This is how you think, this is what...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It becomes something, a flash of something you can recognize, but there's some separateness from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: And I'm still... so that is what?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560564\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Feeling more and more egodystonic. It's not... it's no longer taking away your sense of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Okay, got it. [0:03:57] So these things that... what I just talked about, that... okay, so that's egodystonic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yes, and it's moving in that direction, where it's a thought that appears or a sense, oh, I could have those feelings, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: But it's not really who I am, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It's not really who you are. That's connected to your mother's voice or your... the sense of all these old feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. Those are like the voices and thoughts of... more of your environment and your context that don't really have anything to do with who... your essence of who you are. Got it. That's awesome, okay. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Sorry for the big words (chuckling). It's jargon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: No, I want to know what those words... that's awesome. Yeah, because even... I was walking around, and it's not that I don't feel melancholy? Yeah, because I do think... I'm like, yeah, why am I...? Why have I been able to accomplish a lot of other things, but I can't... I haven't... why haven't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">I had one relationship that I can point to and say, yeah, that was exactly the kind of girl I wanted or very close to the kind of girl I wanted, and she lived around here, and...? You know what I mean? [0:05:07] And it was all just nice. We just dated, even if it didn't work out. We dated, and it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">nice, and she was my girlfriend. You know what I mean? I don't get that about... that is a mystery to me still. I mean, I get what some of the factors might be? But I guess what I'm saying though is, even when that kind of bums we out, I'm walking around, I feel melancholic about it? But I don't... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200513\">yeah, it doesn't change the consistency of my days, you know what I mean? How I am daily, you know what I mean? Which is amazing. But I can also see how that's kind of unsettling, because then I have all this space in my mind (chuckling). [0:05:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that used to take up so much energy and space and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. I've... I was just reading... I always go back to this Julia Kristeva book about... have you read this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Which one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Depression and Melancholy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I read parts of it, not the whole book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Okay. But anyhow she's French, so half the time who the fuck knows what she's saying? But I did notice though that... I was reading some sentences. And I do have trouble... I still have trouble kind of concentrating or focusing in the moment (pause), but less so. So there were some sentences <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">where I was like, oh, I think I know exactly what that sentence means (chuckling). That's a good feeling, instead of just reading it and being like, wait, what? What did I just read? I don't know what I'm reading. It's getting a little better with stuff like this that before I'd be like, I just have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">no idea what's going on here. [0:06:57] I don't know what these words are. I don't even get the... and I even have moments where I can't follow the grammatical structure of the sentence, which is really disconcerting. But now I don't get upset about that. I just... I'm like, fine, just keep going, don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D3\">stop and get all stressed about what that... and then eventually I pick up one sentence that I really get. And it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Because also, Artuk (sp?), you're talking about reading some pretty heavy-handed authors who a lot of people don't... I mean, people spend entire careers trying...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560564\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. But you know how it is. If you're both an artist and you've also been in school and then grad school and then... I mean, you know how it... people talk about this shit as if they... some of them are faking it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Right, no, I'm with you. But still, if you're someone that is like me, that's really intimidating. [0:07:56] Then it makes you feel shitty that you don't... how come you can't talk about things like that, or...? Even if they're pretending, why am I not able to read that and then pretend some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">very intimidating articulation about that or something? You know what I mean? I'm just not... it's not in me. That's one. And two is I just... I mean, then there are people who do have substantive things to say about stuff that they read. And I think I'm in that camp, so it just... it bothers me, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">it has bothered me when I just feel like I'm just glazing over (pause), because I know that some of that is definitely... yeah, you're totally right. Who knows what the hell they're talking about? But some of that also... I think it is just my situation. When there's so much static constantly, just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200653\">you're being barraged by negative thoughts and this, worries, and whatever. [0:08:55] Even reading Danielle Steel would probably be... I'd probably forget the paragraph I just read. There's a lot of that. Sometimes I do get what I'm reading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah, (crosstalk), that's different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I'm just forgetting immediately. I can't retain information. So that's gotten better. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, now it's sort of moving towards where there's more freedom to say, okay, I didn't get those sentences, and not be so critical of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, now I don't care so much. Like this book. I don't care now that I'm reading it... I flip through it. I read different chapters. And I go back to the beginning, and I read that again. Who cares? In the past I was just... I'd be very dogmatic and hard on myself about that shit. Like, no, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">you pick it up, and you read it, and you make notes, and rrrrrrrrr (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was really hard on myself. But again it's because I projected. [0:09:56] I assumed or I imagined that there are other people who get these things, and they make little notes. What are those notes that they're making? What's the...? What are the insights they're having when they read <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">things, and...? Yeah. It was really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Other people. Because I hear your notes all the time about the things you're reading. You have notes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Right, but again...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: I don't know whether you're writing them in the margin or not, but you have things you're thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, but you know what I mean. It's like with everything else, written (ph) music, just that projection that I always have that some... even though I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, other people somehow...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Are doing it better, or they're more together, or they're the real thing, or they're something. I don't know what... how to describe it. But yeah, I have a great band, and I'm a good songwriter. But somehow I'm not cool enough, or I'm not whatever that thing is that I'm perceiving that other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">people have (pause), that now I know is just exactly that. [0:10:59] It's just what I'm projecting or thinking that I perceive. It's just another way to kind of put yourself down or to think you're less than other people. (Pause) So yeah, now that I don't feel that as much, it's much easier now. I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">pick up a book, and who gives a shit? I just want to read a couple pages of this, and I'm done. I don't have to write a paper about it. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560564\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Or if you want to read more because you want to read more you'll read more...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: But not feeling like you have to in order to feel good about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Or that, even if I read it from cover to cover, not caring whether I have major insights or whether I get everything she's talking about or... so... (Pause) But yeah, I think just in general that's the big... yeah, I really kind of... yeah. [0:12:01] Today I was kind of just walking around, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">just kind of feeling the feeling of (chuckling) not having extreme feelings. It was just interesting. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Feeling the feeling of not being manic or depressed in a way, having an ordinary emotional life, which has feelings. [There are going to be] (ph) feelings, good, bad, ugly. I mean, they're all there in ordinary people. But they're not... it's not just waiting for this terrible darkness all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">the time, being on top of the world, it's not... [it just hasn't been like one of those] (ph). But I think that's... you're saying it's really disorienting. [0:12:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, just... yeah, it's just very... (Pause) Yeah, it's just so new. It's like, I don't... (Pause) Yeah, I guess it is disorienting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I also think another piece you're talking about, as we were talking about all these authors and philosophers and theoreticians... that it's starting... is, what if these aren't the other who have all the right answers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Right, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Because I think that's been a comfort for you to sort of... the people who know what they're talking about and who are really smart and write a lot and are... sound like they know what they're talking about. And it also is a way of feeling bad about yourself, that there's this whole body <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">of people like that. [0:13:57] And what if they have some things to contribute? But what if you disagree with some of...? What if you think they're wrong? Or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Right. What if they're just regular...? At the end of the day they're just people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Who had a view that were entrenched in their own histories or their own time, their... that's kind of disorienting, too, because there's no one on the pedestal anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Right. That's true. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: You could be reading something and start saying, what a crock of shit, or she doesn't know what she's talking about (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, I think that a lot of times when I read this I'm like, it's just this typical French... I think there's something there. But I bet you she could say it in ten pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:15:00] But, I mean, at the end of the day, all this stuff is... (Pause) Now it's about kind of doing something constructive with... you know what I mean? (Pause) I think that's the next step, is being more productive day in and day out, because I'm still not. But it's much better. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">But... (Pause) I mean, that's why I'm really glad I did this. I feel really nervous about the business. But see, now, I was just washing my hands down... I suddenly just remembered, oh, I have an office. And the good thing... now it's fucking real, you know what I mean? I can't be talking about, yeah <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D2\">(ph), I wonder how I'm going to market to... it doesn't matter. It's just got to get done. I need to figure these things out and pursue them and do them and... (Pause) [0:16:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560564\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">So that's a good feeling. That's a really good feeling. If nothing else I'll have those blocks of time (chuckling) in the beautiful office to gather my thoughts and write or read or study for being a life coach or doing my... maybe... whatever. I don't know. I was like, maybe I should just take... I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">should just start taking some psychology courses anyway. I mean, I could just go to U Mass or whatever and just take some courses. Or online it's so easy now. But anyway, that... there's this... things are getting a little more... I'm forcing things to get more structured and... you know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">[0:16:58] (Pause) Because that's a big part of it, too. When you have time to be scanning how you feel and think all the time, that's not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Everybody gets cranky (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. So you need some kind of... I mean, I want my flexibility. I want whatever, whatever. But the reason I want all that is so I can have the kind of structure I want. It's not that I don't want structure or work, you know what I mean? But... so now it's time to enact that, put that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">together. (Pause) [0:18:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: When is your first day at the office?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Monday. I didn't know if it started September 1st or October 1st or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess I could... yeah, no. I mean, I guess I could have used it yesterday. I have it Mondays and Wednesdays. 12:00 to 4:00. But yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So you could have used it Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I could have used it Wednesday I'm pretty sure, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Not yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Wait, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, Wednesday. Right, today's Friday. Sorry. Yeah. I suppose I could have, yeah. But... (Pause) [0:18:58] Yeah. So Monday I'll just go and start kind of figuring out what it's like, if... what the deal is and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Do you have set hours? I assume that there are blocks. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: They do it by blocks. 12:00 to 4:00 Mondays and Wednesdays...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Which is also why I had to move fast. They had other... I mean, I think that's a pretty good... it seems to be a lot of the time that people want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: And I had a feeling no one wants to see a life coach at 9:00 AM or... I mean, I don't know. I think later in the day is... I mean, I still worry a little bit. I don't... (Pause) What about everybody that's working 9:00 to 5:00 or whatever, things like that. But whatever. I mean, obviously I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">here. People are here seeing therapists and whatever. So... but yeah. And then I wonder, I don't know if there's flexibility with that once you get going or... I don't know. I don't know how that works. [0:20:00] But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, if I had some clients where they were like, I really can only come at this time, at that point I'd have to figure out what the deal is. But... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560564\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: That will interfere with our Wednesday time then. 12:00 to 4:00?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Not right now, but yeah, at some point if it did then... because right now it's all open. So I could just tell someone to come at 2:00 or 3:00 or 4:00, whatever. But... oh, that's the other thing I don't know. Does 12:00 to 4:00 mean the last client... like, do you need to be out by 4:00?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) yeah, because it's a four hour block, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: It does, right? Four hour block. Okay, that's what I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So you have a 12:00, 1:00, 2:00, and 3:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Right, okay. Oh yeah, that's interesting. So wait. [0:20:56] 12:00 to 1:00, 1:00 to 2:00... oh no, you could still see hour people, but chances are (inaudible at 0:21:03). Yeah, no, I mean, I'd have to have people conflicting. I mean, I hope I have that problem at some point, but... (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">Yeah, that's... I mean, I'm a dumbass if I don't take advantage (chuckling). You know what I mean? If I'm not there at least writing, reading, working on the business, you know what I mean, that could be my time to just... see, even that. Instead of constantly... if you don't have something structured, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D32\">then you can always be thinking about it and not... this way I'm like, all right. Well, until I have the clients, those hours are for business, marketing, networking, e-mail people, I don't know, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I think that's why I raise our appointment time, because that already's going to interfere. [0:21:57] Will you go there for an hour and then come here and then go back (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Probably. Yeah, I mean, it's right here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You'd lose an hour of your time that you paid for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's... well, that's okay. I mean, that's okay for now. It's... but yeah. I mean, yeah, it's... it gives me that... or even with writing, you know what I mean? Okay, I'm going to work on the business a little bit, but then I'm going to... there's just no excuse now, you know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">It's a beautiful place, peace and quiet, nice sunny vibrant place. It's on me now. So I think that's... I could tell I needed something like that to kind of... you need a good kind of pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: So what will stop you now come Monday? Do you think you'll be there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don't think anything, no. I mean, I'll be looking forward to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You didn't go Wednesday. I wondered why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well, Wednesday was the day I gave the lease to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: I felt like it'd be kind of weird. Like, here's the lease. I'm going upstairs. [0:23:05] So yeah. (Pause) Definitely have to figure out the marketing thing though. Now it's... you can't just be sending out e-mails hoping to get clients or whatever. I've got to figure out a way to... a more specific <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">kind of marketing. (Pause) [0:24:00] I was just thinking about Cecelia? (Chuckling) And I was thinking, today was kind of chilly in the morning. Even little things, like when I wake up, she has a habit of... at least every other day, when I wake up, I'll feel her (chuckling). I mean, it's just ridiculously <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E72\">cute. I sleep on my side? And I will literally feel her crunched up and mashed in this part of me like this? [0:25:00] It's like we're spooning (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: And I was thinking about that. I was like, that... even that is... I almost don't know what to do with it. It's so... every time it happens I can't... today I was... (laughing) and she also kind of took some of the blanket. So I was pretty cold. And I was not... but I didn't want to... I didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">want to scare her away or get her off the bed (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560564\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: So I was just laying there. But even stuff like that is... I'm just not used to it still. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: What's the feeling? [What's it like] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: It's just beautiful. It's like, now I get it. Animals are... you're not really human until you can connect with a pet. It's just such unconditional love. [0:25:56] And it's so peaceful and sweet. It's just an amazing thing. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: And safe. I mean, she feels so safe with you to be able to nuzzle her way in and curl up wherever she wants to, and take up whatever space she wants to, and know that it's okay (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Right, yeah, it's very sweet, yeah. And then when she does get up she'll just come up, and she just... they just know not to scratch you or... so she just puts her paw... she'll just go like this or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Or she does it on my head, or she just licks the pillow right next to me. It's... that's just crazy. It's such a beautiful thing. She somehow knows, okay, I'm not going to use my claws for this one. It's so amazing. [0:26:56] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Well, she's attached. I mean, she's feeling loving affection. She's not wanting to attack. It's not even in the realm of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, rag dolls are like that anyway. But then, when they do get attached to their owners, I think it's even more like they're just very affectionate, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: So affectionate. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: I mean, it's crazy, but now I can see why my crazy advisor here... especially someone like that who is a lunatic, now I get why his cat is his best friend, I mean, because he's so fucked up that... (Pause) It's... I'm not comparing me, but I see why some people who don't have friends, who don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">have... (Pause) [0:27:59] It's sad, but at least there's comfort in... of having this living creature with you who depends on you and who... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: Well, around him (ph) you feel safe, too. If he's that vulnerable or has that many defenses up or (crosstalk), there's so much self-protection going on [because he's been] (ph) so hurt somewhere or (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: That's right, yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: You know you're safe with an animal.

But I think, because of the way I've been feeling, I almost don't care that much. It's a weird feeling. It's not that I'm not looking forward to it. I just kind of... I don't find myself caring the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">I used to. I care about making music, releasing, whatever (ph). But I just kind of don't care about the shows as much, I guess. I don't know. [0:30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: So it's connected with the feeling you're having wandering around (crosstalk) what is this in between...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's not extreme.

But everything was right on, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">everything sounded right, everything... I don't know. [0:31:01] Maybe that's why, I guess.

I mean, just the weather's nice. I was just... and I was just aware of the fact that I was (pause) fine. That was basically... I was like, it's a beautiful day. I'm fine. I can't think of anything that's really... I'm not really depressed, whatever. But I also don't feel amazing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">you know what I mean?

(Pause) It's not stopping me from also feeling pretty good. You know what I mean? So yeah, I was just kind of like... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: And I wonder, I guess, how that then... so then you come in here. Does that also throw you off here, [what do we talk about then] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: I get a little more anxious here, yeah, because I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: Because I can imagine that, if you're feeling depressed, you know what to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: Right, yeah, I do... not anxious, but yeah, I do feel more... a little more jittery or like I'm not sure, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Or like, almost what else is there then (ph)?

I... yeah, I don't know... <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">yeah. (Pause) But that's maybe exactly it in a way. Those themes lead to deeper (pause) feelings, actual... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: In a way, Artuk, one of the things you're saying is there's something then you get to start to know about what comes up inside of you isn't some extreme problem going on that's very easy to identify and talk about... is not trusting yourself, not trusting that what will come up will come <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">up, even if it's a surface thing that is the first thing that occurs to you, that it comes up for a reason. [0:34:16]It connects to other things, and nothing comes out of nowhere, and everything has a meaning. There's not... you're not trusting of... just trusting of your mind, so you get to relax and just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: I think it's partly that, yeah. But it's partly... it might be more that I just... when you're so used to extremes, it's almost like I don't even know what I'm thinking about, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: I... yeah, I guess I feel lonely. But yeah, I don't know. You know what I mean? So that's why I'm saying maybe that is... for at least maybe it is good to be like, yeah. I'm not sure if I feel that lonely right now, but let's talk about loneliness, you know what I mean? [0:34:57] Because then <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201371\">that does lead to... (Pause) And I think that's kind of the whole point now of coming here.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560564\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: It's not about, today I feel like shit, or yesterday someone looked at me funny or whatever the fuck, or I feel amazing. They're not these extreme things that have to be worked out or whatever. They're just... now it's a much more... (Pause) I don't know, it's a much more nuanced kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Now we really get to know you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: Which is really different than knowing your problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: But I think it's partly what you're saying. You're still getting used to the problems? [0:35:58] What's going to be there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's all been either problems or inflated kind of euphoric kind of stuff, you know what I mean? So... but yeah, mostly problems. So... or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: I'm even including that in problem, as something that's not as grounded in reality trying to [sort out] (ph) who you really are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, right, it's not grounded. Yeah, it's not stable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: If nothing else I've just been used to a really high state of anxiety all the time, good or bad. Now it's like, yeah. Last week, the last few weeks... now I feel... I think now that I did this I feel... whatever anxiety I feel now, it's anchored to something. It's like, well, yeah, no shit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">I mean, I just signed a lease. So now it's about work and that kind of... whereas before last week, it felt abstract and just a more existential anxiety of, I'm doing... what am I doing? [0:36:58] I think it's when you anchor things into either a lease or whatever, a job or whatever it is, then you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F2\">can feel anxious. But there's comfort in the fact that there's a concrete thing that you're thinking about. What was my point? Oh, but yeah. But in general yeah, I just... I don't feel that same level of nonstop anxiety at all. So yeah, it's just kind of... (Pause) It's like when the ocean is super <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F3\">stormy and fucked up and that's just what you're used to. And then suddenly, if it's calm and there's beautiful sunlight and... you're like, holy shit. Look at all the stuff in the water, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: Ooh, that's a good one. I'm going to write that down. Suddenly you're like, there's a whole world in the water. [0:37:58] (Chuckling) Forget about what's going on up here. So that's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's so different than trying to survive the storm. It's so different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. Survive, or thinking that, well, this is just it. This is just the weather. It's not a storm, it's just... so... (Pause) [0:39:00] It's a perfect metaphor. That's the one. It's even better than the coma one, because then it's like, not only is there a world under the water. But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201571\">even though it's beautiful, then you're kind of scared that you might fall in. (Laughing) You know what I mean? You're like, shit, I don't know if I'm that good of a swimmer or... (Pause) Or what if some of the stuff down there... certain things look beautiful but they're really not? Or what...? (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201572\">Or some of them look awful, but they're not. They're just all different creatures. They're just all different things.

It's strange. Or maybe there are. [0:41:55] But I can't... what's the word? I can't... my mind doesn't latch onto anything. I'm just kind of, I don't know, just (chuckling)... it's weird.

[0:42:59] It's funny because I wonder if subconsciously... because that's one thing I've... I love watching documentaries and stuff. But yeah, something feels really claustrophobic to me about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Going that deep, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">CLIENT: That deep, and the pressure that builds, and...

That's awesome. [0:43:58] Yeah. I guess when you think about it, it's not... I mean, what's the fear really? It's... you have your oxygen tank, you're down there with the critters, and... I don't know, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">THERAPIST: Well, it is such a metaphor.

For me it's those two extremes, either being really high up or being way below. I mean, I can go to the top of a building? But I don't really want to go to the edge or... I get freaked out if people go too close <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201971\">to... I don't get freaked out. But internally I start getting really nervous when people get too close to the edge. So that's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">THERAPIST: So floaties and a mask sounds good (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's awesome.

[0:46:07] But because I've had so much skepticism over the years. I don't know. Or things are such a clich sometimes. But... (Pause) Yeah, it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B71\">just all these little things. I mean, a lot of it's just superficial. All of it I think is just superficial for the most part. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B9\">THERAPIST: See, I don't know. It doesn't sound superficial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">CLIENT: That's... no, I mean my excuses are superficial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">CLIENT: But I think ultimately it's just... I don't know what I would say, or how's it going to feel, or... (Pause) Or what if it somehow changes our dynamic or something?

[0:46:59] It took so long to get to this point, I just kind of feel like, oh, this is nice. So... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Well, you can stand on the side of a boat for the rest of your life looking in and never taking off because it feels perfectly fine on the side of the boat (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">CLIENT: I know, right (chuckling).
