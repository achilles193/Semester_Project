I haven't been able to do any good stuff. And I can, you know, through bits and pieces if I occupy myself. Otherwise, sometimes I get my mind off of it. And it's like I ended having to, like I ended up not going to work at all last week. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000E1\">I was going to go in on Tuesday. It was like snowing and stuff, but once I (inaudible at 00:00:34) I also didn't make it in either because I just couldn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20010\">And I've been having, I guess Well last night was a Seder and I had alcohol and stuff, so I didn't have any trouble sleeping last night. But like the night before and I had trouble sleeping then. And just all this panic and I don't know where it's coming from and it won't go away. And I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200101\">my meds aren't working anymore. And I don't have any way to stop it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20011\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012\">THERAPIST: Well I know when we talked last week, the house stuff and the living situation was something that was a big deal and you think talking about it was important, but also brought up a lot of anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20013\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014\">CLIENT: I mean except that from Monday evening on I spent the entire week at my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20015\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016\">THERAPIST: How was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20017\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018\">CLIENT: It was better. It was nice to have my own bed and stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20019\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C\">CLIENT: And also I wasn't commuting so it wasn't like I could really see whether or not it was making a difference within (ph) me. I mean I knew I was going to be at my house anyways because my friend Nora was visiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001D\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020\">CLIENT: So it would be weird to not be staying at my house when my friend was staying at my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024\">CLIENT: So (pause) (sigh) So being at my house was better. But it didn't -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20025\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026\">THERAPIST: How did it change things between you and your boyfriend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20027\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028\">CLIENT: Um. (sigh) I'd think it would be we're less tense, though then on Saturday we got into a really big fight and almost broke up. And then we -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20029\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002B\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C\">CLIENT: (sigh) It's just so I couldn't - I kept on getting Like he was doing things that were making me angry and I got mad, and then he got mad, and he couldn't deal with my anger. And I was telling him that, you know, I was thinking that maybe we should break up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002D\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030\">CLIENT: Like we both were thinking it and then we both decided that we want to stay with each other. I realize that I overreacted, even though originally I had thought I was right, I don't even remember what the issue was anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20031\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20033\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034\">CLIENT: But I had thought I was right. But then I was like, \"Okay, this makes no sense. I shouldn't be reacting this way.\" And he was afraid that I had turned into this person who was always upset all the time and he wanted the real me back. (inaudible at 00:03:00), but it makes sense that I leave than <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200341\">having We've been okay and only minor problems that we feel like we can resolve right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20035\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036\">And I told him last night that I thought it would be helpful like if I'm upset, that will upset him. If he's upset, that'll upset me. But if we're like upset and not at each other and maybe telling each other, \"It's not you.\" So that we'd be less likely to internalize it if, you know, it wasn't something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200361\">that we were causing, and the other person was not mad at us. But (pause) I've still been breaking down.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20035-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099990\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20037\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20039\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A\">CLIENT: And, I mean, I'm running a little bit low on sleep and I probably need to take a nap this afternoon to catch up. It's like Sunday night I got out of rehearsal at ten-thirty but I couldn't get to sleep until like three-thirty. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E\">CLIENT: And well first we had to do some Passover things, like the finding the chametz and stuff like that took a really long time. But then after that I just couldn't sleep. And, oh, also we had dropped on Friday the car. The bumper, there was this part. Like the bumper had been dented for a while, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E1\">but there was a part underneath that started dragging on the ground and we couldn't drive the car like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20041\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042\">CLIENT: So we put it into the shop, so that There was a reason why I mentioned that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20043\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044\">THERAPIST: You were talking about the timing of why you went to bed so late and couldn't fall asleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20045\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046\">CLIENT: Oh, because the next morning, we were renting a car because the car is going to be ready either this afternoon or tomorrow, so we were renting a car and we had to pick it up yesterday morning. And we had to do the Passover shopping. And so Sydney hadn't been clear about the fact, like I asked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200461\">him if I needed to be along for the car and he said he would strongly prefer it. Which I thought meant he would strongly prefer it but it didn't mean that I actually had to be there. It was like, \"Do I have to be there?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20047\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20049\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A\">CLIENT: And that he would have said, \"Yes.\" And so then the next morning he was all like, \"You have to be there.\" And I was like, \"I asked you.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E\">CLIENT: So it turns out that \"strongly prefer\" actually means \"yes.\" (sigh) I don't thing he's being Like he thinks it's a politeness thing. I think it's like, if you don't say what you mean you are going to cause more problems to be, and then that's not really very polite at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20051\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052\">CLIENT: But at least I got him say at least [for the most part of the time] (ph) if he is going to say, \"strongly preferred,\" it does mean \"Yes, you do have to do this,\" or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20053\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20055\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056\">CLIENT: And he just doesn't want to come out and say it. At least if it's consistent I can deal with that. But, yeah, because we were going over the Haggadah and I probably would have tried harder to fall asleep if I knew that I wasn't going to have a chance to catch up on any of that sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20057\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058\">THERAPIST: Mm. So it wasn't that you were necessarily trying to go to sleep. (cross-talking at 00:06:21)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20059\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A\">CLIENT: Well I was at first. We were both at first. And then we both couldn't sleep. And then we were like, \"Okay, why don't we go over the Haggadah and stuff for your Seder.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E\">CLIENT: We tried at first. So there was a period where I couldn't get to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20061\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062\">CLIENT: So, yeah. Everything is a mess now. Like I'm worrying about all the days I've missed at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20063\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064\">THERAPIST: Everything is a mess. What is all a mess?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20065\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066\">CLIENT: Well the fact that I can't keep myself together. Like I barely made it to the services today. I had to be there because I was leading the service. You know, well I was fine while I was there but started panicking again as soon as I got out of services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20067\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20069\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A\">CLIENT: You know, and could barely get here. And Sydney dropped me off and Sydney is going to pick me up because I don't even think I can make it home on the T.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20069-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099990\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C\">THERAPIST: What are you afraid would happen if you went home on the T?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E\">CLIENT: (sigh) Well I'm just not sure that I'll have enough will to force myself to walk to the T station and get on and do all those things. Like those things all seem really, really hard to do right now. (crying) Like there's these tasks that I would take for granted as things I can normally do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20071\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20072\">CLIENT: Like there's no good reason why I shouldn't be able to walk over. It's not like I'm carrying lots of things or anything. Like there's no good reason why I couldn't take the T.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20073\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20074\">THERAPIST: Although it feels like it's something that is too hard right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20075\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20076\">CLIENT: (crying) Like even getting up off the couch an hour ago or something was too hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20077\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078\">THERAPIST: How did you get yourself to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20079\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A\">CLIENT: Um. (sniffling) I don't even know. I think eventually Sydney was like, \"We should go back upstairs.\" And I was like, \"This is really hard.\" And he was like, \"Do you want to come to the room or not.\" And I was like, \"Okay, fine I'll come in.\" Then I just followed him and I don't really know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A1\">I did. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007C\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E\">CLIENT: But it just feels like it's going to be so much mental energy to force myself to do all these different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20080\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20081\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20082\">CLIENT: Like we still have to cook for Sydney' Seder. And, I mean, he might be able to do it all without me, but I'm not sure. And, (pause) like (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20083\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084\">THERAPIST: Mm. You say you've been panicking but in some ways it sounds more like a depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20085\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20087\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20088\">THERAPIST: Feeling like things are really hard and overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20089\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008A\">CLIENT: (still sounds like crying) Yeah. I think it's both depression and anxiety right now. (pause) And I can't do anything. Because when I called the doctor (ph) and stuff, she called me back last Tuesday because I had called her on Monday to let her know about how I'm feeling with the drugs. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008A1\">she said that I shouldn't have even gotten the serotonin reaction in the first place that I got. But I got it. And it happened. And also that I shouldn't have been feeling any withdrawal. But like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008C\">THERAPIST: But you feel like you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E\">CLIENT: But I feel like I am. Or maybe it's just coincidental timing and I was going to break down anyways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20090\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20091\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20092\">CLIENT: But I can't even be on mood stabilizers.

Like it gives me a certainly high level that I should not have been getting on such a low dose. And the Klonopin seems to be doing absolutely nothing. So I just feel like there's absolutely nothing I can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20097\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20098\">THERAPIST: Ah. So you're feeling like there's no possibilities anymore.

I like my job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009C\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009E\">CLIENT: I just am having trouble (crying) getting to it and stuff.

I might be able to get away with going back to sleep instead of helping cooking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BB\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BC\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BD\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BE\">CLIENT: He thought that me getting sleep, catching up on sleep, would be a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BF\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C0\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Okay, so he's going to pick you up. So he's going to pick you up and take you home back to his place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C1\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C2\">CLIENT: Yeah. The problem is also we're waiting for, he ordered a Seder plate from Israel and it's being delivered today and he has to sign for it and he's not quite sure when it's coming. So I might have to wait awhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C4\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C5\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C6\">CLIENT: Well also keeping myself together enough to leave for him to pick me up whenever that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C7\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C8\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C9\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CA\">CLIENT: And then possibly cooking and then being at the Seder and helping him lead it because, I mean I guess I could, in theory, flee and hide in the room if I really, really have to. But I'd rather not go there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CB\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CC\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CD\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CE\">CLIENT: But if it becomes my only option then I'll do that. (sniffling) And, you know, also have to get myself to eat food. Well it wasn't a problem earlier, but I don't know if that will be a problem later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CF\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D0\">THERAPIST: Okay. Why would it be a problem if it wasn't before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D1\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D2\">CLIENT: Because I'm more panicky now, I think, than I was when I was making [matzoth pizza] (ph) earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D4\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D5\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D6\">CLIENT: So there are like those things. I guess Wednesday, most of the day I could just stay at home and then after like the holiday ends I need to go to rehearsal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D7\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D8\">THERAPIST: Let's take one day a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D9\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DA\">CLIENT: Okay. (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DB\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DC\">THERAPIST: And I know I said the next few days. But I think probably it makes sense to revise that and think about getting through one day at a time right now until some of this panic subsides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DD\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE\">CLIENT: (whisper, labored breathing) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DF\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E0\">THERAPIST: Panic is like a wave. It has a peak and it always comes back down. You don't know exactly how big that wave is going to be, but panic always does start to subside at some point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E1\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E2\">CLIENT: And probably I think I still would have a higher base line than normal. (crying) You know? And it will subside, but I don't know if it will subside enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E4\">THERAPIST: Enough for what?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E3-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099990\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E5\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E6\">CLIENT: (sniffling) Enough to not feel so uncomfortable all the time and wanting to hurt myself and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E7\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E8\">THERAPIST: Mm. You need to tell me about those thoughts of self harm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E9\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EA\">CLIENT: I mean they don't happen that Like it's usually only when it's really bad. Like right now it's just like how I was feeling. Well the Wellbutrin wasn't working where it was like this feeling is so uncomfortable there is no way to end it. I need to end it. (deep breath) You know, also starting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EA1\">to get hopeless with the whole like (deep breath) fear that I won't be able to function enough to work. (sigh) And not wanting to lose my job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EB\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EC\">THERAPIST: Is there any indication that you are going to lose your job?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200ED\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EE\">CLIENT: No. Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EF\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F0\">THERAPIST: When you didn't go to work, did they say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F1\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F2\">CLIENT: No. I mean I even sent an e-mail being like, \"Hey I know that I missed a lot of days. I was thinking of coming in Fridays to make up for those days over, once Passover's over.\" And they were like, \"Oh cool. Come in Fridays (laughs) if you want to.\" (sniffling) So <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F3\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F4\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F5\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F6\">CLIENT: It's just sort of a fear that got planted into me with like originally Sydney and I were planning to do the trip right after Passover. My Mom was all like - I called her and asked her about it because she has miles on Southwest that can be used towards those flights.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F7\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F8\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F9\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FA\">CLIENT: And she was all like, \"Oh you're missing so much work.\" And like, \"For Passover you can't just go and take a vacation like that.\" You know, even though I'd probably only be missing a day of work for the vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FB\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FC\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FD\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FE\">CLIENT: Because I'd do it over, you know, if I have a four day weekend then I have a four day weekend. But, um, (pause) it means, but that sort of got me thinking, \"Oh wow, I am missing a lot of work.\" And then I missed more work for being sick. And I've missed snow days. And also because my Mom was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FE1\">all like, for the snowstorm on Tuesday, I had originally planned to come in late when the report was just like, \"Oh, it wall end by eleven.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FF\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20100\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20101\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20102\">CLIENT: And then when they were like, \"Oh it's actually going to start up again in the afternoon,\" you know I told work that I wasn't going to come in after all because I didn't want to risk my safety on the drive home either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20103\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20104\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20105\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20106\">CLIENT: And but I had called my Mom because it was her birthday and I called [her out for it] (ph) and she was all like, \"Oh, you're not at work.\" And I'm like, \"No. The snowstorm got worse.\" And (inaudible 00:17:22) at she was that surprised about it. Like just reinforced the whole, I could lose my <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201061\">job if I'm not going to work all the time. Even though I have a really relaxed boss. And my job does not at all effect the running of the place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20107\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20108\">THERAPIST: Mm. So you may have a better idea of work's response -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20109\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010A\">CLIENT: (cross talking) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010B\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010C\">THERAPIST: than your Mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010D\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010E\">CLIENT: Possibly. (ph) (sniffling) You know, it's not like I'm not a hard worker. It's just, it like really it's not like this project, it's more like (sniffling) this project will take about a year and the funding is, like I think, I guess the grant probably has to be finished by a certain point. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010E1\">I think if goes a little bit over it's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010F\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20110\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20111\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20112\">CLIENT: (sigh) And you know, I'm getting paid by the hour so I'm not costing them any money for the days I'm not coming in.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20111-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099990\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20113\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20114\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20115\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20116\">CLIENT: So I think it's all good. But now I don't know. And my Mom, has caused me to doubt that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20117\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20118\">THERAPIST: Mm. And those doubts lead to anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20119\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011A\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh) I don't think that's the underlying cause of all of this anxiety though, because I was feeling anxious before that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011C\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. But it seems like it added to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011E\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20120\">THERAPIST: It gave you something to worry about that doesn't really have a clear answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20121\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20122\">CLIENT: True. Though I feel like eventually I would've on my own gotten to the point of worrying about missing so much work. You know I was okay with telling them all the days I'd miss for Passover and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20123\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20124\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20125\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20126\">CLIENT: But if I keep on having these sick days then I, you know. I don't want to lose my job. I wish, like if I could work from home, which -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20127\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20128\">THERAPIST: It's not a work from home job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20129\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012A\">CLIENT: It's not a work from home job. It's one that could. I mean the thing is that they do have the PDF scans of the log books I'm working with. But sometimes things are hard to read and I need to look at the actual log book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012C\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012E\">CLIENT: And it's better, it's easier, well it goes back and forth which one is easier to read depending on what page and how it go scanned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20130\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20131\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20132\">CLIENT: But if I just work from the PDF I could still probably get it and then the software that I'm using for the, you know, writing the [finding in] (ph) to the software that I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20133\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20134\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20135\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20136\">CLIENT: So like I could, in theory, actually do some of the work from home if I were to set myself to (inaudible 00:20:01) and stuff. But, in general, it's (inaudible). Like I don't know if I could, especially because they're not going to be here to see me working and if I want to keep track of my hours and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20137\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20138\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20139\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013A\">CLIENT: I think it's easier just to go. But I Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013C\">THERAPIST: So rather than focusing on how much time from work you might miss or whether or not you could create the ability to work from home, let's focus on getting you back to a place where you can go to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013E\">CLIENT: I just don't know how to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20140\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20141\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20142\">CLIENT: (crying) I don't know that it's possible. And I had seen doctor Hoeg (ph) on Friday, so that, or a least soon, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20143\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20144\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. And when was the next day that you were scheduled to go in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20145\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20146\">CLIENT: Thursday. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20147\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20148\">THERAPIST: Okay. Then it's very possible that you can take yourself to work on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20149\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014A\">CLIENT: Yeah. (whisper) (sigh) Sydney doesn't have anything going on, but it would probably be unfair to ask him to drive me to work and hang around so I could be less -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014C\">THERAPIST: Mm. [Tomorrow maybe.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014E\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh) So it's not completely outside the realm of possibility. But I think given his mental status, I'm not going to, like I wouldn't want to put that burden on him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20150\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20151\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20152\">CLIENT: But I don't know whether or not I can drive safely. (sniffling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20153\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20154\">THERAPIST: Mm. Well, you'll know much more on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20155\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20156\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20157\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20158\">THERAPIST: And it's hard to predict from today to Thursday. A lot could change by then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20159\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015A\">CLIENT: It's true. I don't know if the - I don't know and just don't want to be missing the work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015C\">THERAPIST: You don't need to know now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015E\">CLIENT: I guess I don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20160\">THERAPIST: I don't think you need to make a decision on Tuesday about what you're going to feel on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2015F-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099990\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20161\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20162\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20163\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20164\">THERAPIST: You just don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20165\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20166\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20167\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20168\">THERAPIST: Right now you take it one day at a time and do what we need to do to get you through the things on your list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20169\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016A\">CLIENT: (sigh) Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016B\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016C\">THERAPIST: Because it does, I think your experience is showing you that staying active and doing things usually does help you. Distraction is one of your best techniques for getting through the anxiety. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016D\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016E\">CLIENT: It's just hard to even get myself into a distraction in the first place. I'm just not going to do it.

So eleven other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20183\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20184\">THERAPIST: Mm. That's a pretty good size group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20185\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20186\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which is why I am kind of wanting to hide and run (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20187\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20188\">THERAPIST: Are there any things you like about Seder? Are the positive things you can focus on? Songs or foods or rituals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20189\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018A\">CLIENT: At this point, in general, yes, there are things I like about Seders. Right now all the things I normally like about Seders would be (inaudible at 00:23:59) except for the food, which I'm kind of hoping I can eat. (inaudible) at the Seder then hide in Sydney' room and go to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018B\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018C\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018D\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018E\">CLIENT: But he wants me to help lead the Seder. Just I think leading is going to Well at least he's Well he was at a Seder last night, therefore, he (inaudible at 00:24:20) most things that I (inaudible). You know, we used the same goblets last night that we're using tonight. So there should be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018E1\">nothing in there that's a surprise to him. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018F\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20190\">THERAPIST: So what do you feel like your responsibility is in helping him lead?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20191\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20192\">CLIENT: I guess it's just I'd like to be able to help him if I can. I really don't think I can though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20193\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20194\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20195\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20196\">CLIENT: Like I really think the best thing for me would be to, you know, get a bowl of the lamb stew and stuff before people come over and just, you know, don't even hide, just go to bed early and skip the Seder altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20197\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20198\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20199\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019A\">CLIENT: So that way I could not have to deal with lots of people and having to stay.

I could get a seat closest to the door. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A3\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A4\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A5\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A6\">CLIENT: But it would be awkward, I think, is the other thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A7\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A8\">THERAPIST: Mm. To excuse yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A9\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AA\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I ended up doing it last at eleven.

And I, because it was getting late and I had to wake up at eight thirty so I could get ready to [lead this off] (ph) today and just was falling asleep. And since I was operating on three hours of sleep, you know, everyone <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AE1\">was fine about me leaving.

And neither one of those really seems like a safe option. Feeling like you have to hide is not a good safe feeling, because you still feel trapped and you're stuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C01\">in your room the whole time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C1\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C2\">CLIENT: I guess if I were going to be in my room, I think I'm tired enough that I'd really be sleeping for most of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C3\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C4\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C5\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C6\">CLIENT: So I don't think I'd be too trapped by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C8\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C9\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CA\">CLIENT: I think the Seder is definitely the more trapped option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CB\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CC\">THERAPIST: Mm.

Because the other thing is if I do, you know if I am going to work, I always have to at least make the decision the night before to the extent of getting, going to bed at ten so I have the ability to get to work the next day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FB\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FC\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

Even though he was in my room when I was in the kitchen making all of the soup yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027D\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027E\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027F\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20280\">CLIENT: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20281\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20282\">THERAPIST: It seems that some of this feels kind of like tit for tat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20283\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20284\">CLIENT: Well, more like I feel more justified then in being a little bit less supportive than I would otherwise be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20285\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20286\">THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20287\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20288\">CLIENT: Because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20289\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028A\">THERAPIST: You don't feel like you got that support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028B\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028C\">CLIENT: Well not in that so much as like if you felt that panicked about it, he should understand why I'm feeling that panicked right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028D\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028E\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028F\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20290\">CLIENT: And therefore, you know, I'll do stuff if he really, really needs me to. Or at least I will try to and if I fail then that will at least be a good indicator that I can't do things. But I think when I get back I'm just going to hide in the room and not help out with things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2028F-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028F-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099990\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20291\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20292\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20293\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20294\">CLIENT: (sniffling) If he's okay with out. I mean it's also because he's, if the Seder plate didn't get there in the past hour, after he picks me up I think I'm going to stay while he goes shopping. And I at least I'll be there to get the Seder plate when it arrives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20295\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20296\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20297\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20298\">CLIENT: If nothing else. I won't be completely useless, but I can't be as useful as I normally am.

Anxiety is also very exhausting because your body goes through a lot to be this anxious. To ride these waves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029C\">CLIENT: So I really can't stop being anxious right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029D\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029E\">THERAPIST: But you actually have.

That helped you to take some of the edge off. And that's much more bearable than being at that really high intensity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A7\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A8\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A9\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AA\">THERAPIST: And you can continue to do that outside of this room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202AB\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AC\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Though I don't It's just so hard to just get control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C1\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C2\">THERAPIST: It is hard. It's hard work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C3\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C4\">CLIENT: (crying) I don't know if I have it in me.

Well I don't know if we have enough time to take breaks before the Seder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D9\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202DA\">THERAPIST: But you can.
