(inaudible at 00:02:59) I looked it up that (inaudible at 00:03:01) looking up was just going to bring me down again. So I asked Karl if he\u2019d check it out and he found that it \u2014 basically, there were a lot of women that were talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">it online, (inaudible at 00:03:22). And that definitely made me \u2014 and then I could tell, you know, after \u2014 the next day I was feeling a bit better and then the day after that I was feeling basically normal again. So yeah, it was obviously, there was something \u2014 something hormonal going in there and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">that was (inaudible at 00:04:00) was sort of triggering that sort of response. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">What was interesting is that yesterday I started to get \u2014 I got one of my more normal sort of periods of lowness. And I think because it came so soon after I was able to compare what was going on. And the things I noticed was, I was at home in the afternoon when I was starting to feel it already that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">\u2014 in the morning. But when I was at home with Genevieve in the afternoon, Karl was out and Genevieve is great, but she\u2019s not much of a conversationalist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I was sort of, I guess, focusing and thinking on it and I realized that I \u2014 I really needed to go for a walk. I needed to take her and go out for a walk, and that it would make me feel much better if I could just take Genevieve and go for a walk, which we did. We walked to work because it was a half <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">hour walk and that was around the time when Karl usually comes home, so we walked there and then walked back. And it was \u2014 and I saw (inaudible at 00:05:33) and yes, the sort of the exercise and fresh air and pushing myself to go out was not solving any problems, but it did help to sort of bring me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">back into perspective, I guess in a way. Which was totally different from when I had that sort of \u2014 that issue earlier with the \u2014 and when I got my period and I was going outside and it\u2019s what I remember from before when I was in high school, or going outside and walking was something that \u2014 it didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">help anything. I just \u2014 it was going on and I just had to sort of ride it out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">If I was outside then it meant that I was trying to prevent myself from crying in public as opposed to crying at home. And it probably wasn\u2019t very helpful because, you know, then my (laughter) what I want to do is just sort of hide at home, so I won\u2019t go outside and cry in public. So it was \u2014 that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">just sort of an interesting \u2014 was an interesting contrast for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I guess in a sense just sort of think about what\u2019s something that I can \u2014 what areas are the sorts of thing to work on or dwell on in a way, and what sorts of things that are obviously just \u2014 well, that\u2019s a physical thing that\u2019s not really in my control right now, and I can\u2019t really go in there and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">manipulate what my cells are doing. I guess what was coming out from \u2014 I don\u2019t even really know exactly what was either triggering or just going on yesterday. It sounds funny, but I think part of it was just \u2014 it was gray, so I felt gray. I don\u2019t think I was the only one. There were only four students <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">who came to reception yesterday. So normally, I have 10 to 12. But it was \u2014 (inaudible at 00:09:40) it\u2019s been sort of dwelling a lot in my life since last week was the \u2014 was (inaudible at 00:09:51) thinking about the \u2014 that if you\u2019re feeling \u2014 feeling bad about feeling bad, I guess. And I was, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">I think one of the funny things about it is that it doesn\u2019t really feel like it\u2019s a trait that\u2019s inherent or natural to me. It feels like it\u2019s sort of, I guess, colonizes part of me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562638\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">(inaudible at 00:10:52) funny cause it \u2014 you know, it is sort of a \u2014 it obviously is a response that pops up. So it\u2019s \u2014 pardon me, I guess \u2014 and just another way to twist it around is, it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t really like. And it\u2019s just another way of putting it, but \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">I think that one of the \u2014 (inaudible at 00:12:14) one of the interesting aspects, but when I was thinking about it before was that connection I made with, you know, that I am very conscious that it does come from \u2014 that it does come from growing up with Leah who is very, very focused on the shoulds <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">and ought tos and that kind of ideal of personality. And well, it sort of got me thinking a little bit about these \u2014 and not just of the if personality of (inaudible at 00:13:19). Leah is very much \u2014 she\u2019s very particular, which means that she often times ends up with a lot of, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">carries it far, but she does end up with a lot of things that produce a lot of really great things. So \u2014 well, you know, it was \u2014 but I could tell that that\u2019s where in me, a lot of this sort of (inaudible at 00:14:04). It would definitely have an enormous influence over me growing up. She\u2019s my big sister <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">and \u2014 I mean, my parents point out that as of a certain age when we were kids, if you look at us in pictures, Leah is always looking at the camera and I\u2019m always looking at Leah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">I \u2014 we were just \u2014 we were very close and I adored and do adore her. She\u2019s my sister and I love her. But at the same time, that \u2014 I fully know that that influence had \u2014 in some respects it led me into great places and I read great things. And I tried out things and so on. But in other respects, it \u2014 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">I know that some of the \u2014 a lot of those aspects of myself which hold myself back come from her ideas and ideals, and the sorts of rules that she sets in place for herself, which carried over into me. It sort of \u2014 I\u2019m not a person who has a lot of very clear memories from when I was a kid. So \u2014 but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">when I look back at when I try to sort of cast my mind back, I get more impressions. And a lot of my specific memories come from when I was a little bit older. Usually after (inaudible at 00:16:32) when I was in grade three we moved to Cleveland for a year. My father had a sabbatical year and we moved <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">back to Frankfort, which is where I grew up, and it runs, like, for grade four and five, and then when I was going into grade six, we moved to Cleveland permanently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">And around then is when more specific memories really start. And I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s because when I was a little kid, I was basically just sort of zoned out pretty heavily. I didn\u2019t have a huge number of friends or anything, and I didn\u2019t care because I didn\u2019t really need them because I had my friend, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">Jen, I had Leah. And so, I said when I was at a friend\u2019s house (inaudible at 00:17:27) I often would end up sort of quietly with the parents because I wasn\u2019t very rambunctious in my personality. And I was just \u2014 I was pretty happy. Moving to Cleveland, although ultimately, (inaudible at 00:17:47) had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">a lot of good for me. I don\u2019t think it was much short of traumatic for me in either grade three or in grade six. I was very unhappy. And I\u2019m pretty sure my parents didn\u2019t really realize how much because I wasn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t very talkative about (inaudible at 00:18:29) things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">I just \u2014 I more or less left that to Leah again, you know, I \u2014 she\u2019d know what things were right to say, so she would do the talking. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562638\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">And I\u2019m not \u2014 they knew that grade three wasn\u2019t my best year. But I don\u2019t think that they recognized when we moved to Cleveland in grade six \u2014 they knew I wasn\u2019t happy about it. They knew that I really didn\u2019t want to leave Jen in particular. Jen was my best friend, still is. I don\u2019t think they realized. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">I\u2019m \u2014 in fact, I\u2019m sure (inaudible at 00:19:11) that they didn\u2019t realize that grade six was going to be the year it was for me. It was an incredibly painful year, in fact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: What made it painful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: First of all, I just really, really missed Jen. (inaudible at 00:19:44) Jen. She\u2019s \u2014 you know, she\u2019s \u2014 there are two friends in my life who have meant the most to me, Jen and Lucy. Jen \u2014 I think of her, I (inaudible at 00:20:00) it\u2019s funny, I usually have these ideas, but what comes to mind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">with Jen is yellow. Golden sunny yellow. When Leah got married, I had this idea, at first it was going to be a Sunday afternoon wedding. I\u2019m not usually all about the clothes for sure. But I \u2014 first, it was going to be a Sunday afternoon wedding and I thought that I had this idea of wearing a nice yellow <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B2\">dress. And then everything (inaudible at 00:20:47) changed, upside down, and then it was going to be an evening wedding, and my mom thought I should get a fancier dress. So I got a fancier dress. I wasn\u2019t so thrilled with having a fancier dress, but it was nice cause I got a green one and I like green. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">But when Jen came I just looked at her and I saw just \u2014 I went to my closet and I gave her the dress cause I realized I\u2019d gotten her \u2014 I\u2019d gotten \u2014 I hadn\u2019t gotten this dress for me, I\u2019d gotten it for Jen and she wore it and just sunshine. It\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s \u2014 I mean, a very \u2014 a laughing person. She\u2019s one <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">who \u2014 what she \u2014 she always had pets growing up. And I loved that cause when I went to her house I got to play with her dogs, with her cats. We couldn\u2019t have pets because my parents and Leah were all allergic. So I got them sort of vicariously through Jen and it really, really hurt me to leave \u2014 leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">her because she\u2019s just \u2014 on top of just being so cheerful, making the best of things, very accepting. A little bit more \u2014 I guess more impulsive, less, less held back by things than was my personality. It was something that I liked to see. So it was a pretty big wrench to leave her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562638\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">Also, I just \u2014 it\u2019s funny, when I lived in Frankfort \u2014 either fewer people and it was quieter and all of that, which is more in line with my personality to begin with. But I \u2014 and it was an emptier place, but I never felt really lonely there. When we moved to Cleveland, which was full of people all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">over the place and you could never be alone, I felt very lonely being surrounded by business and noise and people all the time. And then, what was really hard in grade six was I started in a school which my parents just said there was a language emersion school system. I started in language emersion. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F2\">(inaudible at 00:24:18). I\u2019m sorry, a (ph) school system.. And so, I thought it was the best way to continue our culture. It was also a private school where my mother was teaching. But it was going to \u2014 it was \u2014 first of all, they weren\u2019t sure about putting me into school where my mother was teaching. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s called culture emersion school and Anglophones school. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard those terms before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">CLIENT: culture emersion is a \u2014 sort of technical terms in Mid-West. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">And this school was where \u2014 in a more cultural neighborhood of the city farther north. Sort of getting into the more cultural territory, and they were hoping that that would be \u2014 that would continue my language education, which is something I was definitely gung-ho about as well. I\u2019ve always loved languages <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">and I certainly ardently loved French literature, still do. Half of what I work on now are different languages. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">So it was all sort of (inaudible at 00:26:30) for a very good plan. In practice it turned out to be really, really awful. The students were \u2014 it was not a good fit for me at all. The \u2014 it turned out that my class was run by a student (inaudible at 00:26:49) who \u2014 my memory from the first day of class <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">was she rounded up all of the girls in the class and put us around in a circle and she stood in the middle. And based on shoes, she went around and said, you\u2019re \u2014 basically, you\u2019re in, you\u2019re not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: I remember you telling me this story. So this was in which school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: (Speaking in French) it was called \u2014 it was in grade six in Cleveland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So this was the school that your mother taught at?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: This was the other one. My mother taught at the (inaudible at 00:27:20) French school, which is a private school. This was public \u2014 part of the public school system. Yeah, I thought (inaudible at 00:27:26) be that bad, this one before I was sort of \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: And you moved there for your dad\u2019s job? Or you moved there for you dad\u2019s job?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: We moved to Cleveland not for his job. We moved there because \u2014 in grade three we went on sabbatical. Then my father, he left his job in Frankfort. He was a professor at the university there. And he left it for a number of reasons (inaudible at 00:27:58) that year, they had been planning on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">it already. They wanted to move back to Cleveland because they wanted to \u2014 from my perspective in grade six, it was an (inaudible at 00:28:09). But they wanted to move there for our education. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">They knew that the quality of education dropped after elementary school in Frankfort. And they wanted us to have a better education. Also, a Jewish community which just didn\u2019t exist in Frankfort. So it was really \u2014 in a funny way it was for (inaudible at 00:28:45) funny to me now. It was for us. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">definitely didn\u2019t feel that way at the time. I had really loved Frankfort and I missed everything about it. Leah had a much easier transition. And I think a part of what was sort of Frenching for me was that before then, I had really been fairly in synch with Leah. You know, she was much more social <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">than I was. She had more friends. She had more \u2014 she was more of an extrovert. She was just more \u2014 out of there she had the ideas, I went with her plans. But \u2014 and she missed Frankfort and to this day, she has this kind \u2014 she also has this kind of ideal view of Frankfort.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562638\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">She\u2019ll sometimes e-mail me that she\u2019s feeling homesick and she misses the sort of simplicity and beauty and niceness of it. Almost to me, sometimes when I read those e-mails, it feels like I\u2019m reading a fairytale. It\u2019s not how I remember things. I don\u2019t remember, like \u2014 yes, it was beautiful. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">really \u2014 I loved it, but I remember winters being extremely hard. And we had that six foot snowstorm, sure, it was pretty and it\u2019s something to sort of talk about looking back. But at the time it was pretty hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">A lot of mosquitoes in the summer, insanely painful. There are not mosquitoes like that anywhere else. But I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s something about it feels a bit unreal. And it certainly \u2014 like, for her the transition was she had an okay year at school. Then she went to (ph) the high school which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">we both attended (inaudible at 00:31:55). And she had made a lot of friends there, and her husband now is one of somebody who was in her class at high school. It was all fine ultimately for her. I had a real struggle. Until I \u2014 grade six, if I could erase it, I would. Grade seven, I went to a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">school. It was just a grade seven, eight school, so it was smaller. I\u2019d had teachers who were a little bit more specialized in dealing with that rather difficult age group. And one of my \u2014 I\u2019m still sort of halfway in touch with some of my teachers from there who is extremely patient and sweet with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B3\">me. And that\u2019s where I met my friend, Lucy, who like Jen, she \u2014 you know, both of them interestingly, they never went to university, or Jen did a couple of years and then went to work. Lucy never went to university. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">They\u2019re more \u2014 they\u2019re people who both to do what they love, they do it. They\u2019re both very much creatures of the place where they live. Jen tried to \u2014 has tried a number of times to leave Frankfort or the East Coast and she never could. She never could live elsewhere. Now she\u2019s living in Iceland. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">about as much of a deviation as she could make from there. And I cannot imagine Lucy anywhere other than Cleveland. And it\u2019s kind of interesting to me that the two friends I needed to sort of anchor me in a way, are both people who both sort of move to their own rhythm. Are not so concerned about conventions <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">or making \u2014 or what\u2019s perfectly right all the time. They don\u2019t worry about making mistakes because they\u2019ll just try again later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">(inaudible at 00:35:53) just sort of getting \u2014 trying to think back. Because a lot of what I, you know. A lot of what I \u2014 it\u2019s funny, a lot of what I know about my growing up with Leah and (inaudible at 00:36:18) is what I heard from my parents or other people in a way. Because as I said, my own memories <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">are kind of sparse from when I was younger. My mom, my dad (inaudible at 00:36:45) would all comment on Leah being kind of bossy. (inaudible at 00:36:50) kind of (inaudible at 00:36:53). My mom remarked many times to me that, although you\u2019ve always been very protective of David. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562638\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">Or her telling me that she remembers that I would always be very excited when Jen came over to play. But I\u2019d usually end up sitting someone else while Leah played with Jen. And then I have a memory which is, I was always very excited to go over to Jen\u2019s house to play. Partly I think because of the animals <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">(inaudible at 00:37:40) the cats. And it\u2019s also partly because I did \u2014 I don\u2019t remember from when I was littler, but when I was older I definitely remember certainly (inaudible at 00:37:54) back, that I had this sense of Jen because we were the same age, being very much my friend and then Leah wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200532\">to play with us all the time. And I sometimes felt a little bit left out, I guess, in a party of three instead of a party of two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">I think I had a sense that I wasn\u2019t very good at having friends when we came back from Cleveland. I think that\u2019s when I began to sort of feel that difference between Leah being quite good socially, and me being sort of awkward, bookish, on the outside. Not really knowing how to play. I feel that I wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">very good at being a kid. I had a \u2014 and, of course, like now, I look and I think there are all kinds of kids. I just had a feeling that I wasn\u2019t very good at it. That I seemed to get along better with many adults. Of course, now when I think about it, I probably just didn\u2019t \u2014 hadn\u2019t really found a good <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200552\">group of kids. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 or I didn\u2019t have a kind of chameleon personality which can fit in with very many people. I still don\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">But I remember when I \u2014 I guess this was around in grade four, grade five when we came back from Cleveland before we moved permanently, when I was on the \u2014 in the playground with girls at lunch or recess or something. And I wanted to play at the only things I ever really wanted to play were something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">about fairies or myths or something like that. I read fairytales, I\u2019d read mythology. I was obsessed. And (inaudible at 00:40:20) and who grew up on a farm nearby. And sure, she was very nice, but we tended to butt heads (inaudible at 00:40:34) as much as I could. I wasn\u2019t really very good at that sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200572\">of thing. But she was (inaudible at 00:40:43) she wanted to play horses because she grew up on a farm, she loved horses the way that I loved cats and mythology and (inaudible at 00:40:52). She loved horses. She loved the things that (inaudible at 00:40:56) she saw every day. And I said okay, yeah, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200573\">fine, we\u2019ll play horses. I don\u2019t know a thing about horses, so I wanted to be Pegasus because that was the horse I knew. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">She was furious. She was so angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">Because (inaudible at 00:41:18) I still don\u2019t really know very much about horses. It could be a black horse or a white horse, I don\u2019t really know anything about horses. A mare, a stallion, I guess, but horses don\u2019t have wings.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562638\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">There wasn\u2019t a horse on her farm who had wings, so can\u2019t do that.

It\u2019s just that sort of \u2014 that\u2019s where I was, like, with other kids. And so, I just \u2014 and the great thing about back in Cleveland was when I (inaudible at 00:42:20) her, it was sort of like, she read every \u2014 she just \u2014 there\u2019s a reason, I think she didn\u2019t go to university <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">because she\u2019d read everything that was in all of the course textbooks. And she just read everything. And my \u2014 the way I felt at that point was that that it gave me enough of somebody to hang out with that just let me mark time until \u2014 until I guess I reached the more \u2014 it\u2019s (inaudible at 00:43:24) I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200672\">wanted to go to university. I wanted to go to university, not just because I wanted the courses and the more \u2014 you know, being able to write about what I wanted to write and choose my classes. And I wanted to go to university because you didn\u2019t have lunch hour. You didn\u2019t have recess. You didn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200673\">a cafeteria where all of the kids go and you have to find a table to sit with other people, I found extremely stressful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">You had \u2014 I tried to live in the dorm for two years, but then since I was in Cleveland, I just \u2014 I lived at home for the next two years. Because I didn\u2019t \u2014 the messiness just got to me too much. And after that (inaudible at 00:44:28) was just these greater degrees of sort of independence, I guess. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">of course, the thing is that all of those stages in between are supposed to teach you about getting along and making compromises and so on. And I guess what\u2019s really the \u2014 something that wasn\u2019t \u2014 I guess it\u2019s not an issue of getting along and making compromises. I do both of those things extremely well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200692\">I\u2019m not the most social person in the world, but I definitely don\u2019t mind, you know, people who are different from me or whatever. No, my issue that I didn\u2019t manage to work out in those stages was how to say in (inaudible at 00:46:16) that (inaudible at 00:46:17) that, okay, you don\u2019t have to like my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200693\">shoes. Why would I care whether you like my shoes or not? They\u2019re comfortable, they work, they provide that layer between my feet and the ground that they\u2019re supposed to do. If you don\u2019t like them, fine. You don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s not your business. That\u2019s the problem that I didn\u2019t manage to work out in <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200694\">those stages, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019re doing it now under fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And in the emersion \u2014 the emersion experience of having to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: Feeling less equipped than you\u2019d like, but defining the issue, which is half the battle and understanding the issue.
