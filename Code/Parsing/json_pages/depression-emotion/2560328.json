So where are you? [I\u2019m in] (ph) a lot of different places. I wonder what\u2019s top of mind for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I guess in a couple hours I\u2019m leaving with my sister? My mom called Tuesday. There was a cancellation in her surgeon\u2019s schedule. So our surgery is tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: And they won\u2019t know until this afternoon what time surgery is. So Emma and I rearranged\u2026 scrambled and rearranged stuff (chuckling). And we\u2019re driving so that we\u2019ll be home around midnight. And then whatever time it is tomorrow it is. So (pause) yeah, that\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But you wanted to be there to be at her kind of bedside, or to help out at home? What\u2019s the\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Both. Be there before, during, and after the surgery. She\u2019ll be admitted and then hopefully come home Saturday. So I\u2019ll be there for all of that, especially since we don\u2019t know that my dad has any coverage. So\u2026 [0:01:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: So he might not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t\u2026 he didn\u2019t say. I would assume he doesn\u2019t have coverage, because that\u2019s short notice. So\u2026 (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: His wife\u2019s having urgent surgery. He won\u2019t shut down for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I think he\u2019ll try to get coverage? I don\u2019t know how feasible it is. He has quite a heavy, heavy, heavy animal (ph) load. And there aren\u2019t a lot of large animal vets period (chuckling), let alone in the area. So he does have people that he\u2019s covered for a lot. And hopefully some of them\u2026 but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">when they cover I think it\u2019s almost exclusively for emergencies, and then he cancels regularly scheduled things. Today is always his\u2026 Mason Dixon farms, he does them. And it\u2019s like a huge farm. So that\u2019s out of the way. But yeah, that\u2019s a big thing for him. So we\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s mostly\u2026 when you say large animal, is he most\u2026 exclusively large animal? [0:03:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Exclusive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Okay. So farm animal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: So (chuckling) dairy. He does a lot of dairy. But he also does llamas, alpacas. He does deer. He\u2026 I mean\u2026 goats, swine, all kinds of\u2026 he\u2019s primarily dairy. Anything large (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: He did an elephant once. There was a circus animal that needed\u2026 he took\u2026 needed stitches and [made them large] (ph) (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Wow. So it\u2019s a real specialty then.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560328\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes (laughing). (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: So anyway it\u2019s all the anticipation of this weekend then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s bad. And when I talked to my mom on Tuesday she\u2026 (Pause) [0:03:56] I shouldn\u2019t have felt anything maybe, but she was saying how\u2026 I said, well, you know we were planning\u2026 Emma and I already made all the plans to come home at the end of the month. We\u2019ve been planning on that since you told <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">me. I wrote the date in my planner. I\u2019ve been\u2026 she\u2019s like, I never knew you were coming home. I didn\u2019t think anyone was coming home. I didn\u2019t think anyone was\u2026 I never heard that. I said (chuckling), Mom, I\u2019ve gone over this with you multiple times. No, I never thought anyone was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so pretty much acted like nobody cares, nobody was going to come anyway. I\u2019m just... she was like, I just wanted to let you know, as if it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, a really small thing. And it\u2019s frustrating because I know she\u2019s in a vulnerable place. And she\u2019s really worked up about the surgery. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">It was just hard to hear that it was almost like\u2026 she almost keeps pushing away, asking if she can drive herself home, all that kind of dramatic stuff. It\u2019s just hard, because I don\u2019t think she\u2026 not that it really matters very much. [0:04:59] But I don\u2019t think she realizes we\u2019re coming to take care <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">of her, but we\u2019re also coming because we\u2019re concerned. And this is upsetting to anyone who has a loved one. And it\u2019s just\u2026 it feels like, I don\u2019t know\u2026 almost like a slap in the face, like, well, I didn\u2019t think you were coming anyway (chuckling). I told you we were coming so many times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve had that conversation (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: We\u2019ve had that conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Do you think she\u2019s just playing it off characterologically (sp?)? She doesn\u2019t actually forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think she actually... I mean, we didn\u2019t\u2026 we knew that her surgery was on the 28th. And I had said, I didn\u2019t know if we were going to come in on Tuesday or what time exactly we were going to come in, but that we were planning on it, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So she knew she could work that as, they might not have come anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: (Laughing) I think she knew\u2026 it was pretty clear, and then that she\u2019d never heard about that, it was just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: So she really plays the kind of woe-is-me martyr. No one cares about me and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Which is hard, because I\u2026 again, I legitimize that my dad\u2019s not around a lot. [0:05:58] And that is real, and she\u2019s not making that up. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re not your dad, and your sister\u2019s not your dad. You\u2019re separate people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: No, and she\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s experienced that with my dad. I really do get it (chuckling), in a different role, but I really do get it. And it\u2019s just hard because what she\u2019s going in for is obviously very serious. So I can\u2019t say that she\u2019s overreacting or she\u2019s\u2026 but it\u2019s just\u2026 it hurts <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">to be pushed away to be kind of insulted with, well, I didn\u2019t expect you to come home. You can just come home later in the month, and we\u2019ll do fun stuff instead. It\u2019s just, she has to know to some extent how that comes off? And then my sister called her back later, because my mom hung up on me. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200652\">like, I think I caught you at a really bad time, Ramona, that you\u2019re upset about this. And so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: She doesn\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560328\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Because I was just thinking, let\u2019s say\u2026 I mean, maybe she\u2019s saying to herself, this isn\u2019t that important to me that you\u2019re there. [0:06:56] I\u2019ll be fine. She could just say, let\u2019s talk about it, because it doesn\u2019t feel that important to me. Is it important to you? What does it mean to you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">to be here? Have a more direct conversation about it. But it\u2019s all very passive. It\u2019s like there\u2019s passive aggression (inaudible at 0:07:10).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but this is not something new. And it\u2026 and then my sister called her later. And she said Mom was very relieved that we\u2019re coming home. And so I think she\u2019s just really worked up and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: She says one thing and means another actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: And her saying that she thinks that my dad was planning on how to get all her stuff out of the house\u2026 because clearly she\u2019s going to die from this surgery? That\u2019s what she\u2019s implying. It\u2019s like, she doesn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think she means that. I don\u2019t think she thinks that. I don\u2019t think she actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">believes that there\u2019s a high chance of her dying from this surgery that her surgeon does at least twice a week. I think it\u2019s more she\u2019s really upset. And unfortunately it doesn\u2019t come out in an appropriate\u2026 her comments aren\u2019t very appropriate. [0:07:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">So it\u2019s just\u2026 (chuckling) it sucks quite frankly, because it\u2019s hard. I really want to be compassionate, and I really want to go home and pretend like I\u2019m not upset that she pretended we were never going to come\u2026 like, nobody cares about\u2026 so I\u2019ll pretend like none of that\u2019s going on and not respond to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">any additional comments and want to be compassionate. But at the same time it\u2019s just hard to hear those things sometimes. And\u2026 (Pause) It\u2019s just hard. I get that she\u2019s mad at my dad? I get it. I really do. But saying something like that and having that picture in my head is not\u2026 it\u2019s not helping her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">It\u2019s not helping me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah. The feelings you understand. The root feelings, I think, make a lot of sense to you. But the way she handles them and expresses them is crazy. It\u2019s not helpful to either one of you. It\u2019s very passive, or it\u2019s very aggressive. Or it\u2019s very distortive. It\u2019s not direct communication, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">it\u2019s not communicated through the right people, to your dad instead of to you. [0:08:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: No, and\u2026 but, I mean, this has been the norm.

It\u2019s the same thing, some of this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: But I do feel bad, because I do\u2026 she\u2019s already\u2026 my mother has been depressed for the\u2026 if not all of my life, and pretty significantly so, debilitatingly so. And it\u2019s hard\u2026 I\u2019m sure that this is not\u2026 I mean, anyone would feel depressed if they got a cancer diagnosis? That would be a normal, healthy\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">for someone who\u2019s already depressed and already isolated in the house all the time and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and what a healthier response would be to that is to say, I\u2019m so\u2026 I\u2019m having a really hard time, I\u2019m so depressed.

And that\u2019s Ivan, too. I don\u2019t need anything, I don\u2019t want anything. It\u2019s all my fault. You don\u2019t even deserve to be with me, don\u2019t worry about me, when he\u2019s actually secretly then taking anyway. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t need or want anything. It\u2019s just underground. Your mother\u2019s doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">the same thing. Don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t come. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll drive myself. But secretly she wants you there. And she\u2019s going to take it once you\u2019re there. And she\u2019s sort of\u2026 she knows you at some level\u2026 that you\u2019re going to come. [0:11:00] She knows that. But she does it in this very passive way instead <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200892\">of being more direct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I know. It\u2019s just hard to filter out\u2026 (Pause) She really is scared.

More direct about the feelings. The feelings are so understandable, so understandable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I get that it\u2019s not okay. It just hasn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s only helpful after I hang up the phone or after I\u2026 to take some space and say, I\u2019m not going to get worked up over these comments. [0:12:02] Or I\u2019m not going to\u2026 that\u2019s her. It\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s okay to not\u2026 it\u2019s just really hard. And I\u2019m really hoping <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">that this weekend I don\u2019t respond and I don\u2019t get drawn into trying to engage in\u2026 when she says something like, your father\u2019s going to move my stuff out.

This is what your mom does. This is how she distorts her world. It has nothing to do with you actually. And so how do you get enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">distance in a way to start seeing (ph)\u2026 what you\u2019re doing with Ivan is, wow, these are his deficits. It\u2019s very sad and disappointing. [0:12:58] And you\u2019ll come back here when you\u2019re back and be able to sort of just sit with who she is and how this all went, and how sad it is that you have to get some <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D2\">distance, even when you\u2019re there, in order to tolerate her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just (chuckling)\u2026 it\u2019s always hard. Even if something like this wasn\u2019t going on, it\u2019s really hard to not get drawn into the same thing I\u2026 and as it is Emma and I are fully planning on taking care of all 20, 21 now, of the pets, while\u2026 because now she legitimately will need that. And my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">dad\u2026 I told Emma, what is going to happen when we leave? She\u2019s like, well, he\u2019s going to have to step up and take care of them. And I secretly thought to myself, or they could not have 21 pets. Wouldn\u2019t this\u2026? (Chuckling) And I hate\u2026 I really do hate this about myself. But\u2026 because this should be the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F2\">farthest thing from my mind with my mom being sick and with everything going on. [0:13:54] But I thought, what if she could finally think for a minute, given this, this could be a bit of a... she needs to prioritize her health care or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560328\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Maybe (ph) this would be a wakeup call, instead of 21 pets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Or I thought, I wish she could find some really\u2026 spend some time and find some really great homes for some of them.

And I know that shouldn\u2019t\u2026 but it\u2019s just something that\u2019s been so\u2026 something I\u2019ve always hated that I really\u2026 I think it\u2019s inappropriate for me to look at this as a way to change that. But it\u2019s just, it still drives <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">me insane that I will go home, and I will clean, and I will take care of the pets, and I will mow the lawn, and I will\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You are so judgmental of your thoughts and feelings. So judgmental of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: But I think it\u2019s important to keep yourself in check. I think it\u2019s important to realize that, even if my dad is always a workaholic or my mom always has 20 some pets or the house is\u2026 they think they still stay in this huge house with all of that? [0:15:02] And they don\u2019t take care of it. I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">love them and try to have a good relationship with them regardless and try to let go and try to stop changing it, because ultimately they would need to do that. It\u2019s just, I hear this rational side. And I really get it to an extent. My sister has had this talk with me about a million times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Saying what? What\u2019s the rational side?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: We can spend all our time cleaning while we\u2019re home, doing projects, working nonstop, we can spend all our time doing that. When we leave, it\u2019s up to them. And when we go back it\u2019s always\u2026 with the exception of two visits in the past couple years it\u2019s always gone back to exactly the same. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">Emma said, maybe it would be wiser even if it\u2019s difficult to just try to have some quality time with them, even if my dad\u2019s not home or my mom is hiding in her bedroom. [0:16:04] Just try as much\u2026 or, if they\u2019re not interested, go out on our own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: With her, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just not easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Because it doesn\u2019t sound like it makes too much of a difference if you clean and do all these projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: I think it\u2026 Emma is trying to say, and I think it\u2019s important to me. I really genuinely hate that my parents live like that, and I of course want to do it for them. But it\u2019s psychologically painful to be in that environment and think about that environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s almost what you do to manage your feelings when you go home.

[0:16:59] And if I had been able to ever\u2026 one of the summers that\u2026 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">spent every summer doing the same thing and taking care of the house all summer long. And, if I had ever caught up enough or got a good enough plan or strategy or way to manage it all, that it would have been different. And I know that that\u2019s not reality? But it really\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you how strongly\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: That feeling (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yes, and it felt like, if I could change that, that then my parents would get along. Maybe my dad would come home, maybe my mom wouldn\u2019t\u2026 I think I magnified it so much. And it\u2026 I mean, it felt important for very legitimate reasons. It\u2019s important to have a clean place to go home after school. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">It\u2019s important for everybody to have a clean, safe environment, a sanitary one at least. So that feels true. But it was more\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a whole fantasy in a way, that if only you could get it clean enough and in enough order, everything right for a second, that maybe the whole system would change. [0:18:03] Maybe your dad would start coming home more (ph). Maybe your mom would feel less depressed. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a tremendous sense of responsibility. When we go home, we will more than likely talk to my dad yet again about the fact that he is diabetic and gets fast food on the run in between calls and has gained\u2026 he lost a lot of weight. Now he\u2019s gaining weight back, and how we should talk to him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">And it\u2019s just always\u2026 talk to him about cutting back, talk to him\u2026 it\u2019s just, it feels like so much responsibility and I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Like you and your sister are the parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s\u2026 that role reversal has been in place for many years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Always.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: And now it feels like trying to undo that is almost stupid, because they\u2019re actually getting to the point where there would be a natural shift. [0:18:58] There would be a natural shift for the adult children to take care of them. (Chuckling) So it feels like we\u2019re getting there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That, I think\u2026 still the reality of that sometimes (inaudible at 0:19:10) when you reach that turning point where you\u2019re taking care of your own parents more, I think for you could still feel different than the feeling of it being compulsive. Do you know what I mean? It sounds like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">you still feel at some level like you just have to almost. You can\u2019t not clean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: You cannot\u2026 it doesn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s not an option psychologically to not do those things. Your parents, when you\u2019re not there, are somehow functioning. (Chuckling) (Pause) Do you recognize that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: They\u2019re surviving. I don\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re surviving. I\u2019m not saying their functioning level\u2019s very high. But they\u2019re going to do\u2026 they\u2019ve been doing that. [0:19:55] They\u2019re going to keep doing that. They\u2019re not going to change by your getting it cleaner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: No, but it just\u2026 I know this is a problem. But I can\u2019t let it go. And I know that\u2019s something I need to work on. But it\u2019s not that simple. Not cleaning the house sounds like a really simple thing to do. Psychologically, that\u2019s not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560328\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so I hear you saying\u2026 you\u2019re sort of saying to me, not even a chance (laughing)? I don\u2019t even want to talk about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: What would happen if you didn\u2019t? What if you went home, and you couldn\u2019t clean, you were not allowed to clean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: I couldn\u2019t stay in that house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what\u2026? So you\u2019d start getting so anxious or antsy or mad or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: So anxious, so worked up, so upset. Every time I walk in that house I am so upset and so devastated and so disappointed and so\u2026 I hate\u2026 I just\u2026 it brings it all back. And immediately I am right back where I was. And it\u2019s like I never left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So it really triggers you and pulls you back into being like a child, how it felt as a child. [0:20:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s completely\u2026 I\u2019m right back there. And I\u2019m just as vulnerable. And no matter how old I am it feels like I\u2019m right back\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So here\u2019s the only thing. You\u2019ve found now in your marriage, much to your surprise, that you\u2019ve been playing out the fantasy of, if only I do enough, if I clean enough, if I take care of everything, then somehow that would make things better? It isn\u2019t true, right? You end up so resentful, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">angry, falling out of love if you\u2019re doing everything. It actually doesn\u2019t solve the problem. The fantasy isn\u2019t true, is not going to change your parents. It\u2019s not, I don\u2019t think, oddly (ph) going to make you happier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: No. [0:21:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re any happier. So you get it clean, and then you hate them, and you\u2019re resentful. And now your weekend was spent cleaning all weekend long instead of actually spending quality time or doing some things you might want to do yourself when you\u2019re down there. (Pause) I actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">don\u2019t think you feel better at the end of it all. You might in the heat of the moment feel good. Like, it feels better to get the counter clean rather than stare at those spots (chuckling). But at the end of the weekend and it being now clean, and you know it\u2019s going to go back, and you know nothing\u2019s changed\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s never the belief. I know it sounds crazy. But there\u2019s never the belief, once it\u2019s cleaned up and once\u2026 or once I\u2019ve tackled a big project, there\u2019s never the belief. I never think about that, that it\u2019s going to go back the same way, that no one\u2019s going\u2026 I never. I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">tell you how many times my sister and I have both begged and pleaded with my parents, hire somebody to come in and clean the floors at\u2026 anything. [0:22:57] And of course my dad would say he wasn\u2019t going to pay for it, which, if my mom\u2019s not working or volunteering or anything under the sun, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF2\">I could understand that would seem silly. (Chuckling) But\u2026 and she\u2019s not been able to\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 I can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s so deeply disturbing. And it almost feels\u2026 it feels good to go home and see\u2026 not to see the disaster, but to dig into it and to take it from that and make it clean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">And on some level it\u2026 parts of it feel absolutely necessary. If we\u2019re going to actually have dinner together at\u2026 (chuckling) in the home, I really do need to clean the dining room floor and the dining room table and clear off so there\u2019s a place to sit. That really does have to happen. And it\u2019s hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">to stop at the basics. It\u2019s hard to not look around. It would be impossible. [0:23:54] My sister always tells me, just tidy up your room if stuff has been left in it or whatever. Clean it up? And you can stay in your room. You can have a clean place to stay, and that\u2019s all you really need. It feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F12\">hellish to stay in there. It just\u2026 (Pause) I had a nightmare last night that the end of the weekend came, and my mom said, you haven\u2019t been here long enough, you haven\u2019t done enough. It\u2019s not long enough. And I\u2019m\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560328\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: I am something of a rational person to some extent. And I can say (pause), I get it. Cleaning the house isn\u2019t going to fix things. It might be important, but it\u2019s not going to stay that way. It\u2019s not going to fix the\u2026 that was never the underlying problem. My sister has tried to teach me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">a million times. That\u2019s\u2026 the fact that the house is clean is just a symptom of much bigger problems? [0:24:57] It\u2019s one thing to get it, and it\u2019s another thing to accept it. And I just can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: See, I think the piece, the lynch pin that\u2019s missing in just challenging that cognitively\u2026 because it sounds, Ramona, like you can say what the distortion is, and you can say what the challenging counter-thought would be pretty\u2026 very accurately. But there\u2019s some\u2026 I think what feels like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">missing is knowing how much you are regulating your own emotions by cleaning. It\u2019s funny, because it can look like behaviors (inaudible at 0:25:29). But I think there\u2019s actually a lot of feeling you\u2019re having. And I\u2019m also struck today by\u2026 we\u2019ve been talking [a little bit] (ph) about the layers of armor <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F72\">and how much feeling even does or does not come up here with me, where you\u2019re, quote, allowed to and even supposed to have all your feelings, and how much your armor has protected you from being vulnerable and actually relying on another person to be accountable, to trust that they\u2019re going to do what <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F73\">they say they\u2019re going to do or not. [0:26:16] It feels\u2026 say, I can feel your armor a little thicker today? And it feels like the preparation for going home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: It has to be. I\u2019m already anticipating that it\u2019s not going to be a great weekend. It\u2019s not going to be pleasant. There will be those comments. I\u2019m sure the house will be a mess. I\u2019m sure that the new pet will infuriate me, and I will have to pretend like it doesn\u2019t (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: You know what you\u2019re in for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not even going to\u2026 there\u2019s no debating that. I think it\u2019s probably\u2026 it sounds realistic. That\u2019s not an aspersion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">CLIENT: No, it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what you\u2019re inching into this weekend. I don\u2019t think we yet have hit on the enormity of how much feeling there is for you in even just that, what going home is like for you. [0:27:02] There\u2019s so much feeling, that I think you thicken up. You get in that kind of lockdown (ph) clean <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201031\">mode because that\u2019s how you keep in control of all of the feelings that you are having. Do you know what I mean? And I think until there\u2019s some other way that we, you and I, figure out of allowing those feelings to be more a part of you and be safe in your adult life, even when you go home, or finding <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201032\">some other ways to manage those feelings\u2026 defenses are good to have. We don\u2019t want to have no defenses. They protect us sometimes. We all need them sometimes. Even going home, everyone needs some defenses going home to their families. No matter how long you\u2019re in this work, it triggers a lot of old <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201033\">stuff for people? But there may be ways that this particular set of defenses is so compulsive that it hurts you. [0:27:58] You come home really hurt and wounded over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560328\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">It may not be. You may end this work and say, nope, whenever I go home this is kind of what I\u2019ve got to do to take care of myself. That may permanently remain\u2026 I feel very respectful of whatever unfolds this weekend. You\u2019re doing the best you can do with what\u2019s inside you. But I think just the starting <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">point is, trying to think a little bit and let yourself feel, as this weekend unfolds, what you are feeling. And if there\u2019s any space to allow that to happen, to come out more\u2026 maybe you and Emma would go out to lunch or something, and get out of the house, share some time together. Even getting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201052\">the hospital might be a relief, right? Being away from your home. Cleaning your room where you sleep sounds totally reasonable. You\u2019re allowed\u2026 you want to create a space where you can feel safe and comfortable. Maybe there\u2019ll be little teeny places where you can say, you know what? [0:28:54] No. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201053\">going to let that one go. And I\u2019m instead going to go for a walk. Or I\u2019m going to instead go run an errand with Emma or something. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Of course for you you need to get the dining room table clean if that\u2019s where you guys eat, and have some clean dishes and some places to cook if you\u2019re going to be helping out with the cooking. That all seems like taking care of Ramona\u2019s psyche, you know what I mean, in a way that is reasonable? <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201091\">Maybe there\u2019ll be places where you\u2019ll start to notice that there\u2019s a little room to say, how else do I take care of me? Where are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just really anxious, when Ivan\u2019s getting home today, that I won\u2019t see him at all, because I\u2019m going to be leaving. And he\u2019s actually at Dr. Bourd, or he will be this afternoon. He\u2019s going straight from\u2026 and then he\u2019ll go straight from there to work. And so I won\u2019t see him at all? [Right <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">now] (ph) he\u2019s not really talking to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t been talking on the phone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: He called on Sunday. [0:29:58] And I had told him I wasn\u2019t up for talking about the day. I wanted\u2026 [was ready] (ph) to talk?

He called yesterday morning, and I said\u2026 I reminded him of that. And he said, no, I thought we weren\u2019t talking because you needed space. And I said, no, that\u2019s not fair. I told you, when you\u2019re ready to talk\u2026 (chuckling) so he put it on me, which he usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201171\">does. And when he goes home he usually is very busy, because they do a ton of family stuff, which\u2026 (Pause) Anyway, he said he wasn\u2019t sure how to find the words. And so he still hasn\u2019t. None of it\u2019s happened. And I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about separating. And I told Emma<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: You did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: How\u2019d that go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t cry, I didn\u2019t anything.

That is not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Good. Good. You two are witnesses for each other. You have each other when you\u2019re down there. (Pause) I\u2019m glad you found your anxiety, Ramona. And I think that\u2019s even a little crack in the armor, to say this is actually what you\u2019re feeling, terribly anxious. This is really scary, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201291\">weekend, for so many different reasons. [0:31:55] Where you are with Ivan, that\u2019s all up in the air and uncertain and not being spoken right now. You\u2019re headed home into the environment of your home, per usual, and with everything that that carries all by itself. Your mom\u2019s going into the hospital to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201292\">have surgery, major surgery. That\u2019s scary, whether you hate her or love her or whatever your feelings are about her, about the house. That\u2019s terrifying, she\u2019s your mom. So no wonder you\u2019re scared and anxious. And I actually think the more you get to have some of those feelings and just let them be, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201293\">and let them be ordinary and understandable and expectable right now, you might not have to get so compulsively, and even self-destructively, driven into the kind of clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: There\u2019s no room for any of those feelings.

I\u2019m supposed to be hearing back from people, and it\u2026 unbelievable amounts of anxiety. And there is no <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B1\">room to\u2026 there\u2019s just no room for it.

For working over time, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s actually true or <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201351\">not. But I hear that right now it feels like that\u2019s the only way to be.

It might not even cross your mind. So you\u2019ll let me know <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D1\">when you come back. Be in touch. You know I\u2019m around if anything gets really hairy. Okay?
