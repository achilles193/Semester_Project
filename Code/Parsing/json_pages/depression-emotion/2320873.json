Like she died of old age. But she died like in April when she died. (pause) She said that she's thinking about getting another dog, but you know it is kind of weighing whether she wants the taking care part of another dog versus actually having the dog. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">Yeah. I think I'm sort of like my mom's go to person to talk about therapy with at this point, which is okay. (laugh) I mean it's yeah, I also sort of have a one track mind these days and so like, I don't know how I feel about that. I don't know if I'm fine with it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I feel sort of surprised to hear you say that you didn't have a good sense of my mom. I'm not sure why, because I guess I don't really talk about her very much, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I don't know I felt like I had talked about her more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">(continued pause) It feels like when I talk to her it's (pause) (sigh) I feel like I'm just I feel like I'm very aware of how hard it is to be, I want to say be assertive, but in some ways it's just like be a person in the world. And so I feel like I get sucked into like being her cheerleader and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">that, and like I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">I sort of resent that I sort of don't like sort of don't \u2013 sort of wish that I didn't resent it. So like we were talking yesterday about like subway manners or \u2013 and she said \u2013 you know she was saying that she didn't take the subway anymore because I don't remember actually what she was talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">about, or what we were talking about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">But I remember I like \u2013 I disagreed with her, not in a big way, but I said well I take this approach when she said that she'd taken that approach. And she said well, yeah, I guess, I guess the way I was thinking about it isn't right. And I said well, and introduced a way that like reconciled the two. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">And said what about this, and she's like okay. And she's clearly like super relieved to be like okay, I'm not wrong here. Like I know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: (long pause) The angry was wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">(very long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I have before (pause) I don't know I feel like I have to take care of her and I feel like I should take care of her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: I mean I feel pretty okay about that a lot of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Like \u2013 (laugh) I was going to say, that's something that I'm pretty good at.

(laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I can see that. Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: (laugh) But I was like, this is something I need to drink.

(growling) (laugh) (pause) Yeah I just don't, I don't like Mother's Day because I don't like not being able to be happy for other people who have good relationships with their mothers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">You know most of the time I can be happy for other people. It's just like it doesn't, doesn't exactly work. (laugh) It doesn't work for everybody.

And I'm just \u2013 like I open the screen that I'm writing about and then I go and do something else on my computer. I'm like just find myself doing other things when I intend to be writing without even realizing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: (pause) You know I have a pretty good sense of like what I want to talk about. So \u2013 which you know usually I'm like a I'm at the stage where usually I kind of feel like a blog post, like something I can put out on the blog you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: I think about things and kind of mull over it in my head and figure out where I want to get to, or where I think I want to get to. And I don't necessarily like outline on paper, but I have a sense of it. And then I just sit down and write it. And like sometimes it ends up going someplace entirely <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200891\">differently than I expected, but I just go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">And I've been working on this for like three days and I'm not, you know, more even close to the point that I'm trying to get to. I've talked about it with James a lot. I think the ECT was about as hard or harder for him then it was for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: He \u2013 or at least I think at this point, he's angrier about it then I am.

(pause) What I want to get to is to (pause) I feel like one of the things that I wasn't prepared for and that the ECT psychiatrist didn't take into account was like how much I would lose myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: And how much I feel like I've continued to lose myself and like losing my memory.

And did not give some kind of informed consent to it beforehand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I gave I sort of pictured short term memory loss as like I would forget where my keys were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: And how much was so plain and simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Well, like memory disturbance that like disturbs the simple stuff, the way it sort of unravels a whole bunch of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Hum. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Like the sense of disintegration that goes along with it, and the difficulty of reintegration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Those things are like trauma, or like when it happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: Hum.

And you know it's like exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D31\">the perfect gift for me, and so you know, she really knows me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">CLIENT: And I remember it like the next day. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2320873\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So that was enough to help you remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it was like our tea kettle, our electric kettle just like appeared on our counter one day. Why do we have an electric kettle? I don't know.

Like actively not thinking about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">But I remember like James was asking me the other day about well about the memory loss and it occurred to me like I don't really remember anything about Brown.

But it's not, at least I have heard especially before the ECT, not so much yourself. Not like you would talk about things that happened at William and Mary, and it's like forgot, what classes you took, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF1\">what happened at all to your <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: All things being equal, or you know thing from, even from high school, or undergrad.

I mean there's not a quality of your having forgotten a lot of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201031\">as you talk about it, and with some people there is, and that's just whatever. It's kind of a tie off.. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: But it hasn't seemed that way to me with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: So in my \u2013 I'm conscious that it's more of the ECT then like the disruption of the discussion itself and the repression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Sure I mean there are times I guess where you like, you kind of forget what we talked about from week to week.
