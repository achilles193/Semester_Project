How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I'm doing okay. Let's see, a quick thing about insurance. So Blue Cross seems to be paying up over the rate they said they would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: You saw that too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: (pause) I don't know.

It's not exactly an error, I don't think, for various reasons. At least, I don't feel compelled to let them know. (pause) So, I mean, my thought was essentially just to credit you or write you a check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: That sounds great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Since I asked for it back, I can give it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: The day before you called them \u2014 (pause) I don't know what the order was, but there is the day that we got the letter that (pause) denied the request.

Yeah, so I'll write you a check for what they've done so far and (pause) and I don't know if they'll \u2014 I guess I won't keep doing it if they approve more visits, but we'll wait and see. And can I just have like my bank send a check to your house? Is that okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Or you can remove it from the check that I'm going to write you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I think you're actually ahead at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: I'll double check, but I think that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: That's a lot of money that they're giving you then.

(pause) And my speech was really great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Can I read it to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: (pause) I wanted to memorize it, but I didn't. (long pause) \"I wanted to offer some thoughts about what a special person my dad is. So as any scientist knows, I'm sure most of you will certainly appreciate this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">After observing a system for a while, you can start to form a model to understand and explain its behavior. I will try to lay out a model to describe some of the unique qualities that make my dad who he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">So when I was trying to get some ideas on how to separate this complex system into its component parts, I actually found myself drawing inspiration from dad himself. He's been building models for complex systems for most of his life. Ajuba [ph] tells stories of dad's constant tinkering, exploring and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200571\">building from a young age. Just this morning without my prompting him, he told me about his attempts to build an electromagnet made out of a discarded nail and a wire when he was eight years old and a crystal radio, and this was long before there were kits for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">This inquisitive spirit is captured by this undergrad thesis [inaudible at 00:05:05] for which he designed a model for an innovative harvester which he actually attempted to build. And from my understanding, most people didn't even finish their model much less attempt to build one.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099936\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">The acclaim for his accomplishments and potential followed him wherever he went. He aced his entrance exams without much preparation, and this is an exam that students now take a year or two off to study for. He graduated at age 21 and was awarded a full assistantship to study in the US in 1978. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">went onto to study the problem of non-uniformity in tobacco seedlings for his Master's thesis. His studies took him to the South to study coastal plains farming, and then back where he continued his winding road in graduate studies to the program in operations research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">His thesis was on establishing projection algorithms for specially-structured [inaudible at 00:06:05]. I have nothing to say about that. He was planting the seeds for an illustrious and successful career, and no doubt he loves his work deeply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">But most of what I want to talk about today is how my dad values relationships. Clearly he is a brilliant man who is a scholar at heart. But when you ask him about these times, you don't hear much about the fine aspects of his work. You hear about Southern hospitality, about his first date with my mom, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">his life-long fear of hiking and snakes, about his basketball games with mom's brothers, his involvement with the Indian students association. You hear about his wilderness walks and his Friday Chinese lunches with his colleagues and [inaudible] community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">You don't hear about how it was stressful that I was born hours before his Ph.D. defense. You hear about how he went to the hospital gift store to buy a hair barrette for his baby daughter, and how he passed out chocolate cigars to members of his defense committee after it was over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">So as most of you in this room have experienced, my dad as an incredibly devoted person. To experience his devotion is akin to being carried, not because he takes over or assumes the responsibility or does it for you, but because of the force of his single-minded focus and whole-hearted devotion to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">you and the task at hand really has a way of encompassing you. He takes it on as if it were his own, and he takes you on as if you were his own. And I'm not only talking about a devotion to things that are [inaudible at 00:07:52]. I'm talking about scrubbing down the trash cans in our local temple every <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200692\">time he goes. Tutoring high schoolers in Tom's River.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">I'm also talking about building a gorgeous wooden personalized temple for each member of mom's family, and a deeply special and important part of his life, hosting his [ph] weekly book club of 10 or so which is now in its 11th year. And the devotion part comes in his insisting on maintaining an elaborate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">tea serving ritual, and he doesn't even drink tea anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">And that's the thing. There isn't a lot of separation between mine and yours for him. He has a way of interacting with the world without a whole lot of duality. There's not me, you, self, other. Similarly, there's not a whole lot of happy or sad, angry or calm, frustration or fluidity. He has his share <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">of extreme emotions, but actually he brings a good dose of equanimity to his life. In this sense, dad's way is the middle way. In its great diversity \u2014 adversity, excuse me \u2014 dad has time after time found a way to find freedom and peace.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099936\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">These are all nice words about his free state of mind, but dad is a man of action. His freedom is really borne out of a lot of discipline. His day is a series of artful practices. The daily artful practice of meditation. The daily practice of reading The New York Times aloud to his dad. They both have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">a voracious appetite for reading. The artful practice of a disciplined work-out routine followed by the artful practice of a hot tub soak. The artful practice of preparing the morning oatmeal with the right proportion of raisins, nuts and dates. The artful practice of just about 35 physical therapy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">exercises for his back, neck and knees and this is just in the morning. There are 20 more at night. There is also the daily artful and loving practice of being with, caring for and learning from his father. While this world brings out some of his most tender moments, he also uses discipline to gain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200733\">freedom in this practice too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">He [ph] gets no slack in doing his 35 physical therapy exercises, taking his daily walk or not eating too many sweets, and dad always keeps his best interest in mind. This is not an easy thing for a caregiver. Not a day goes by when dad doesn't acknowledge how much he [ph] has given him and how grateful <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">he is to be together with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">So what's it actually like to spend time with him? Well, all of you in this room know this just as well as me. You actually spend a lot of the time laughing. He makes you smile and he really sees the humor and joy, the ups and downs, the littles and the bigs. He brings a childlike glee to the simplest <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">things, like learning a new technique for pomegranate seed extraction, digging a hole for our new fig tree. He loves digging holes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">Worrying about releasing mail-order ladybugs in his garden while he was sick with [inaudible at 00:11:08] in the hospital. And the big one, taking the time, resources and energy to ensure that each member of his family can and does prepare these two new innovative dishes for Thanksgiving [inaudible at 00:11:23].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">He approaches each experience as if it were the first time with a fresh look. So you spend a lot of time laughing and you spend a lot of time playing, learning how to solve problems. His curiosity and awe for the natural world abounds, and his deep intuition for how things and people work makes it really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">rewarding to go to him with a problem. You learn how to go through adversity. You learn how to treat others and importantly, you learn how to care for and be kind and compassionate for yourself as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">So finally, you can't acknowledge this great man without also acknowledging an extraordinary woman. The spirit, generosity, devotion, support and humor of my mom have helped bring out the essences of my dad, and my dad has done the same for the extraordinary qualities of my mom. So here's to both of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">you, and may your individual strengths continue to be in service of each other and your community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: [It's a nice speech]. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: You're such a loving and devoted daughter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I needed to say those things, I guess. It came out \u2014 it came out pretty easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: I had a couple \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: And joyfully.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. I had a couple of sitting sessions where I just sort of like used him as the object of focus and (pause) then I just like wrote it on the day of the party. I had written down like little notes from each session, and I used my grandfather and my mom for a couple of the examples. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">I spent a lot of time going through his Master's and Ph.D. theses, but what I really wanted to look at was his harvester thesis as an undergrad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099936\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">It's very funny, but we couldn't find it. (long pause) There were aspects of the party that were similar to my wedding, for me, in that \u2014 (pause) Well, some parts were really different, like it was kind of night and day the way that I was like physically not experiencing any anxiety or (pause) tension. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">I mean, I was a little bit playing [inaudible at 00:15:02] in front of everybody. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">Yeah, it was very fluid. But then like once all the people showed up, I found myself (pause) stretching myself thin right away socially, and in like my investment to like connecting with like every single person there. And it was exhausting and I felt \u2014 it was really similar to what happened at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">wedding, but I had the perspective to sort of, I don't know, take a step back and \u2014 (pause) I don't know. Like spent a lot of time with the same people instead of moving from group to group to group for hours which is what feels natural to me. And it also made a lot of sense that I was so tired after <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D2\">essentially like four days of this because I was so tired just after one day of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: That does make a certain kind of sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: It does, but it wasn't obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No, I understand. It just sounds like you worked very hard. I mean, happily, but \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: \u2014 but hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why other people don't work hard or like why it doesn't tire them out. Most people don't float the way that I do. (pause) I mean, one extreme is Jeremy who had people coming up to him all evening, and he was like sort of in the same general area the whole time.

(pause) Yeah, like in the best, most focused way that I can. (pause) So I guess I'm like always thinking about what's going on in other people's lives, like what I can ask them about.

It's not like I'm imposing myself. Like everybody else doesn't feel compelled to be \u2014 to go around the room and talk to everybody because they're only a few people who know every person. So they're like really happy to like engage in a deep meaningful conversation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">But to do that like 25 times.

But that was when I was quite a bit older. When I was a few months old, her [ph] family lived in Virginia at that time, and we would spend many weekends there. Especially during this time that my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201311\">mom was, from what I understand now, very depressed and it was very hard for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: They had just moved there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah, just moved.

I was three weeks old when they moved, and then my mom had never lived away from home and had this new daughter and was like totally depressed for about a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">This is part of my questioning to her, like why \u2014 like she frames it in a way that doesn't focus on the feelings. It's like it focuses on explaining why she was feeling bad and then what she did. She couldn't really do much. It was like she was away from home, my dad was gone, I was like crying all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D1\">of the time. Her parents were very preoccupied. My grandfather had started a business like as a second career, and it completely failed and they were losing a lot of money, so she couldn't \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: What was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: The business?

I mean \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know what his hours were.

So I was like looking at the university's web archive and \u2014 anyway, in the process, I found out that I can look at anybody's dissertation in the whole world, and I spent a bunch of time reading yours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT: (pause) I had to disclose that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">THERAPIST: What were your thoughts and reaction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, okay, so I was like writing the speech so I wasn't really reading it for content.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20164-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20164-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099936\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">CLIENT: I was reading it for nuggets of deep insight about your personality \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: \u2014 and your life and there wasn't really a lot of those.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">So we would go to her sister's house and Selma [ph] was like nine, and apparently she would just like pick me up out of the car seat, like strap me onto her hip and carry me like that for the entire weekend. She would go from place to place to place, and I was really like her doll. We were inseparable <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201811\">and she was completely adoring and loving and like needed and wanted me to go everywhere with her. It wasn't like she necessarily played a whole lot with me, but (pause) just had me with her everywhere.
