He\u2019s (sigh) he like \u2013 he seems sort of talking about it since I guess like last week. And like, \u201cYes, come visit that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">week, right?\u201d I\u2019m dog sitting; it\u2019s just the only sort of commitment that I didn\u2019t feel like I could get out of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Right.

Then like Jason <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">and he were going to drive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And I was like, \u201cWell I\u2019m dog sitting.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell I could just like stay in that house.\u201d I was like, \u201cI sort of feel like I should check with my friend to see if it was okay.\u201d But then like I have to do that. Then it was like he was going to get in super late, and he was like, \u201cWell just leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">key under the mat or something.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cShe lives in (Charlotte) (ph), I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d (chuckle) Like, even if she lives in Andover, like we live in a city.

None of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. No. (laughter) Pretty much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: A little (hyperbole) (ph), that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: So the thing with this \u2013 so I was talking with Candace about this, and she was like, \u201cYep, that\u2019s your dad.\u201d She was like, \u201cRemember what he did at our graduation party?\u201d Which was \u2013 so she and I were living together, and we (inaudible at 00:03:32) and we\u2019re trying to throw this big party. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">made it; we sort of sent out e-mails to like all of our family, being like nobody is going to be staying with us. (laughter) I think that wasn\u2019t like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: So what you\u2019re saying is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: (laughter) I think that was at Candace\u2019s request, because she was like, \u201cI just can\u2019t handle it.\u201d And was like, \u201cWell, if you can\u2019t handle it, that\u2019s a really good excuse for me to not have to handle it.\u201d But so we\u2019re like, nobody\u2019s going to be staying with us; we\u2019re having this party; we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">not invested in anybody actually coming to this graduation, because graduations suck. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562280\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">But like, if you want to come, we\u2019re going to have a party, and it\u2019ll be fun, but you all have to find hotel rooms. Papa shows up, and he doesn\u2019t have a place to stay. And I was like, \u201cWell you can\u2019t stay with us.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019m going to just sleep in the car in your driveway.\u201d (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">(chuckle) And I was like, I really lost it actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">I was like, \u201cThe whole point \u2013 it\u2019s not about space to sleep, it\u2019s about bathrooms. Like we had one bathroom, and we\u2019re two girls, and we\u2019re graduating. We\u2019re going to be using it. You can\u2019t do that.\u201d Eventually he ended up just like he just slept in driveway; that was what he did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">But (pause) (sigh) it was just this same thing of like (pause) (sigh) he\u2019s coming to visit me, because I\u2019ve been in the hospital for depression, and there\u2019s just no way that I can make him understand that the way that he makes plans in itself, it doesn\u2019t help; it\u2019s counterproductive for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I feel like I say that sort of over, and over and over. And it just doesn\u2019t come \u2013 like it doesn\u2019t make across to him. He doesn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s no way that he can come to the city that I live in, that he doesn\u2019t know at all, and not have it involve lots of logistical planning on my part. It\u2019s just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">that just can\u2019t happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">The only way he could do that would be if he was like, \u201cHey James, can you take over some of this stuff?\u201d But that itself would stress me out, because James is trying to do his job. (chuckle) Also like James and my dad are \u2013 often have cross purposes. They get along very well; they like each other a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">lot, but they work very differently, and I have to mediate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. (pause) (sigh) Then he was like, \u201cWell we\u2019re probably going leave in the early afternoon on Friday to get there Friday night.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cHave you checked this on Google Maps? It\u2019s a 12-hour drive.\u201d So they\u2019re going to get here like two or three in the morning, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">have to find parking. And I can\u2019t do any of that; I can\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much permit parking only down where that is; (pause) I can\u2019t fix that.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">So last night I (pause) started sort of crying and hyperventilating when I was considering this, and instead of sort of like going down, it was holding steady or going up over time. And after about an \u2013 maybe less than an hour, but after awhile of that, I\u2019m like, okay, this isn\u2019t actually going to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">\u2013 like I can\u2019t fix it. So I just sort of made turn it off in my mind, and watched some TV then went to bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">Today I just haven\u2019t been thinking about it. (pause) (sigh)  I\u2019m fucked, because I do want to see him, and I want to talk to him, but I can\u2019t do any of that without having to deal with the like anxiety and bullshit of trying to like keep him from (sigh) you know, I feel like I\u2019m sort of like chasing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">a toddler around sometimes. It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t \u2013 (chuckle) you can\u2019t mess with the knobs on the gas stove Sharon, you just can\u2019t do that.\u201d (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562280\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: And you would know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: about chasing a toddler.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: (laughter) Yes. (pause) Except I don\u2019t \u2013 you know, it\u2019s much easier with a toddler, because like that\u2019s my job, and I feel pretty comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re so much bigger than them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) That\u2019s true. Sharon\u2019s in like full-on temper-tantrum stage now. (chuckle) She sounds like \u2013 (pause) in some ways, they wear on me emotionally; it was sort of a rough week actually. But it\u2019s sort of hilarious also, like the stuff that she gets upset about; I just don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">to do except laugh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">So she decided that \u2013 she was like wearing a onesie and pants on top of it. Then she wanted the onesie like not buckled together; it was uncomfortable, so I fixed that. Then she decided that I wasn\u2019t allowed to help her put her pants back on; she wanted to put them back on. But she\u2019s just at 18 months, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">so she (chuckle) really can\u2019t do it, (laughter) and this was like a 20-minute thing of like she was really upset because she couldn\u2019t do it, but would get even more upset when I tried to help her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">And \u2013 (pause) but finally I was just like, \u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m putting her pants on. \u201cYou have to wear pants; everybody has to wear pants.\u201d Then she just lost it, and took them off again. (laughter) So that was sort of unique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Which is much easier than dealing with my dad.  (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Eventually I managed to help her enough that she didn\u2019t notice that I was helping her until she could do it. (chuckle) Which I feel like I should\u2019ve just sort of continued the analogy pretty well. (pause) (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">You know, the alternative is just to say, \u201cJust don\u2019t come this week. Like it\u2019s clearly not a good week for you or for me.\u201d But there\u2019s not \u2013 (sigh) there\u2019s not a way that I can say that without like having this huge load of guilt that I just don\u2019t want to deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Like there\u2019s not a way that I can see that \u2013 say that, and not (pause) feel like that\u2019s me closing myself off from people. Or (pause) (background noise)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">Sometimes it\u2019s like adorable things that the kids did this week. Jackson is really into telling jokes and riddles right now. So I told him the joke that I like which is, \u201cWhat do you call a deer with no eyes? No idear.\u201d And like he really didn\u2019t get it. (laughter) I explained it to him twice, and he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">was like, \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I said, \u201cWell what do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs? Still no idear.\u201d (chuckle) And he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s the same joke.\u201d (laughter) So maybe in another year or two. (laughter)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: [One word] (ph) too, is that I (pause) I think maybe you want my help with your dad. (pause) In other words like, (pause) [clues that sort of he feels is untenable] (ph), (pause) and overwhelming and (pause) potentially dangerous for you. And (pause) I guess maybe in a way, (pause) (background <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">noise) I don\u2019t know what I get is, or that say like, it would be really nice if anybody, but (inaudible at 00:14:47) at me, or I like do something to just (pause) help manage him, or like keep him at a distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">And I think with Candace, like with her e-mail to everybody, \u201cNobody (laughter) will even stay in our house.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562280\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So \u2013 (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like (pause) you know, so there\u2019s like a sort of passive\/aggressive way that I can handle it, that\u2019s just what I do all too often.  Of just like going along with it, and going along with it, and going along with it, and then either like snapping or just sort of continuing to absorb <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">it, and then bitch about it to other people. That\u2019s usually what I do. And that sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">Then there\u2019s like the mature way to handle it, which is, you know, set loving boundaries and sort of say clearly what I need, and (pause) and that\u2019s just exhausting. (chuckle) Like I know how to do that, I just don\u2019t have it in me to do it right now. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: And, it doesn\u2019t work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Like I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: (laughter) It works better but still not very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: The illustration may just be untenable. In other words, like (pause) it seems to me you feel like (pause) you must have some failing if this isn\u2019t working.  (pause) And if (pause) no one can step in and help, must mean you have some failing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (sigh) Yeah. (pause)  (pause) And I definitely imagine that there\u2019s a right course to take somewhere if I could only discern it, that would \u2013 (pause) or make it be \u2013 or make it work in some way. (pause) Or you know, at least make me not feel so horrible about not working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) And you are giving some of that over to me, which I know is not easy to do. Like, \u201cI\u2019m out of ideas Chad.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: \u201cGot anything?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not easy for you to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle) (pause) It feels \u2013 part of it is just I feel so unreasonable about it.  Like, (pause) (sigh) sort of like panicked, and frustration, and (pause) it feels like (pause) it sort of feels like I\u2019m catastrophizing behaviors that\u2019s not actually that bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">And so I can\u2019t tell, and also because like sometimes the way that he acts really is that bad. Sometimes it\u2019s just that it reminded of times when it really was that bad, so he might be, you know, not really out of line, and I\u2019m might just feel like he\u2019s out of line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">I guess I feel sort of disordered, and reasonable when I deal with him, and I can\u2019t tell. I feel like my sort of normal mooring and wearing, but like my normal mooring is all gone. I don\u2019t know (pause) (sigh) I don\u2019t know if like (pause) he\u2019s really a difficult houseguest or if I just sort of think he is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: I follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I (pause) you know in talking to James, I sort of look for that mooring, but James sort of I think \u2013 I mean I sort of think James has unreasonable high standards for plans. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Like that you can\u2019t really trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Although I don\u2019t really even know, like (pause) in some ways, I think I just might need to embrace the fact that I\u2019m not actually that flexible of a person, and just own it. (chuckle) But, (pause) you know there are things that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:57) and incredibly (pause) anxious (pause) to not be able to like have or establish a point of view (pause) that feels right, I think about him. (pause) And to be (pause) having to deal with pretty conflicting impressions, I mean in your own mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562280\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) (pause)  (pause) I guess I feel like every time \u2013 every time that I try to set boundaries around him, I end up feeling like I am (sigh) this very sort of stuffy fragile person. Like, \u201cOh, you know, Tanya can\u2019t deal with having the plans changed at the last minute, so we\u2019ll do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">something that makes her feel better, because that\u2019s what she needs.\u201d (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">It\u2019s like, \u201cWell that is what I need.\u201d (chuckle) But I \u2013 (pause) I just like the killjoy of the family. (chuckle) (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: How does that work? Like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: How does wanting things planned in advance make you a killjoy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a really good question. They sort of feel like at the assumption that spontaneity equals more fun. Which I always feel like spontaneity often just equals like waiting in lines that you weren\u2019t planning on waiting in, and being hungry, and like not \u2013 and getting cranky, because you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">find a place to spend the night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">But there\u2019s the assumption that like spontaneity is like this inherently better thing.  And (pause) (sigh) you know, so Joanne decided not to come with Papa, (pause) and in telling me about this, he was like as I\u2019m thinking about it, I\u2019m like \u201cOh yeah.\u201d He sort of was like bragging on her for it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">Like he was saying, \u201cOh well Joanne likes to plan things in advance, and so she doesn\u2019t like to make changes once she\u2019s made plans.\u201d You know, and said like \u2013 (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Stuffy and uptight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle) (pause) But like I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s partly you know a warning or a condemnation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) And I really believe that about myself that like (pause) spontaneity and flexibility is a good thing.  (pause) (sigh) And so that\u2019s like, but then the corollary is that like needing security is like this great flaw, or this great weakness. (pause) (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">I was going to say that it \u2013 and then there\u2019s this \u2013 it\u2019s like he\u2019s making this Herculean effort to come see me, so I need to be grateful for that. Is like force teaming like, except I was thinking, \u201cDid you see an effort?\u201d (laughter) Which is totally not a (inaudible at 00:27:18). (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Be grateful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yep. (laughter) (pause) I don\u2019t know where that came from. (chuckle) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I think there\u2019s some there. I don\u2019t know what they did. (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: But it is like a Sisyphean effort; there\u2019s no need for him to drive 20 hours to see me for 24. Like I didn\u2019t ask him to. I don\u2019t \u2013 (sigh) (pause) yeah, I don\u2019t (pause) feel particularly grateful for it. Like I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not going to gain anybody anything.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">You know, I\u2019m glad he wants to see me, and I want to see him too, and I miss him, but like I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think that this sort of like frustration and agonizing is actually healthy. (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Well I guess what I think is poignant about this slip is; it seems to me pretty significant to have the conscious idea of your father as Herculean.

And a father with a Sisyphus couldn\u2019t. And I\u2019m not saying that applies everywhere and to everything.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">But I think it\u2019s also \u2013 you probably worked pretty hard to maintain that it was like the first one.

(pause) It seems like there\u2019s this (pause) this value placed on like flexibility, and adaptability and ability. I feel like I\u2019m always the one who needs to adapt. It\u2019s like I\u2019m dog sitting, so I like have to take care of this dog. And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell I know, I\u2019ll just stay, and we\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">walk the dog, and we\u2019ll sort of work around what you need to do.\u201d Like that\u2019s not actually what\u2019s happening. Like \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Right. In a sense that like he\u2019s asking you to ask your friend whether he can stay there, and then leave the key at her place, then do whatever other arranging needs to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2019m not sure he even realizes that that\u2019s what he\u2019s asking, but he doesn\u2019t have to realize that \u2013 it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t have to think about what\u2019s going to go into for me.

And Kim is like, she\u2019s just really pissed off. I think also like it just really hurts. You know, I think she knows that it\u2019s normal, and like she knows that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">it\u2019s a phase and all of that. But it just likes really hurts.

So one of the major projects of like religious people from those theologians in the last 30 years has been to say, \u201cHey, when we talk about God as a Father, like that\u2019s not \u2013 (chuckle) that\u2019s a little bit loaded. Maybe we should reconsider how that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">works for people who don\u2019t good experiences with fathers, and like \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: And they\u2019re like (pause) talking about the sort of human analogies of for talking about God, and those mean things that we don\u2019t intend them to mean sometimes. (pause) I don\u2019t know where we best \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not really thinking anything in particular about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was reading an article about (inaudible at 00:38:58), a very famous theologian who works on this stuff today. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: Well the point is not just that it gender rates God, but also that it (pause) has implications for how people who have had maybe sort of had religion, but their fathers like have [or relayed] (ph) to God to kind of sort of describe -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah. But to like just talk about God as a parent, I mean it\u2019s something that like I\u2019ve had to sort of (pause) like deal with, and talking about God as a parent doesn\u2019t really do much for me, (church) perhaps unsurprisingly. (chuckle) It\u2019s really complicated and hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) I feel like it\u2019s (pause) I feel like in some ways saying that like talking about (pause) (sigh) saying that talking about God in patriarchal terms is problematic sort of misses the point in some major ways. Like the patriarchy doesn\u2019t bother me as much as like God as parent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:41:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, at all. Like that \u2013 actually that sort of (lying) (ph) still really bothers me.

(pause) It\u2019s sort of much easier to get past, the patriarchy in some ways. (pause) Yeah. Kim\u2019s mom \u2013 like Kim talks with her mom on the phone at least once a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Like twice a day with me. And when her mom was visiting, she was talking with me about my mom, and it was like \u2013 and I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not really that close with her.\u201d And she was just like, \u201cOh, well that\u2019ll change once you\u2019ve had kids.\u201d It was very sweet that she just like couldn\u2019t understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">how that could not change. But still, it just hurts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (pause) I was thinking about in two ways; like one in which like you were saying, in a way popularly, there\u2019s no room for real bad parenting. (pause) Like with Kim, or with the sort of (pause) way that theologians try to find God or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">But I think also in your house.
