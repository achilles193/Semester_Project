I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Finally get him on the phone again, Sunday, like noontime. I don\u2019t know. Just feeling really low. I don\u2019t know. He actually wants me to [chuckles] call this woman and tell her to back off.

[chuckles]  I know if it were around here and I didn\u2019t know the area, what I would do would be to try\u2014call a psychiatry department at one or more of the hospitals. Or possible even an ER. See if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">can get ahold of the psych ER and ask if there are good community clinics or other low-cost mental health clinics. Those will sometimes provide sliding scale work for your treatment to people who don\u2019t have much income. Around here, I\u2019m not quite sure how it is now, but there are clinics I know in Brighton <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">and Manchester. There are community clinics.  Or even at some of the hospitals, like probably MGH, Manchester Hospital. (inaudible at 00:14:07) Mental (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">You could pretty much just walk in. I mean, I don\u2019t necessarily mean walk in and get an immediate appointment, but walk in and get treatment. Sometimes pretty good treatment. Often by trainees, which is what he\u2019d be getting, I guess, where you found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">But as you say, they\u2019re either and hopefully well-supervised. And sometimes, the people supervising and running those clinics are really very good. Sometimes not, but I guess that just expands or elaborates your thought with it, along similar lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">But, yeah. If you called outpatient psychiatry at a hospital in the area, they could probably just tell you what\u2019s offered there, as well as where else you could go.  Because that\u2019s probably a referral they have to make a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t know anybody who practices out there who I know firsthand.
