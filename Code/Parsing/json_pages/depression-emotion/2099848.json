(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Sorry to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I hadn't realized how long it had been since I really listened to it, and I all those, I was going to delete a whole bunch of messages and so it made me listen to them before I could listen to anything else. So there were two messages from this guy with the ambulance company. There's been this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">whole thing where Blue Cross said they weren't going to pay for any of the ambulance from one of the times I was in the hospital because it was like a nonemergency thing. And even though, so we had to write a grievance to them to say, \"Well I didn't have the option of refusing to take the ambulance.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: This is like an ER to a hospital, or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: And so that's been sent in and they've received it. Hopefully, they'll pay for some of it at least. But I had forgotten that that was sent in, that we actually did that, because I can't remember anything. (crying sounds and strained voice) So I just thought I had been ignoring this guy from <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">the ambulance company. And then another message was I actually didn't make it through all of the messages because I was freaking out too much. Yeah, I had to hang up. (pause, crying) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So I had applied for this job as a substitute teacher in the city wit the Public Schools like back in January or end of December. And so I had a message from when I was in the hospital in January offering me a job interview. So that didn't happen. (pause and sniffling) So, you know, I'm sort of freaking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">out just telling you about it. (sniffling) I was really freaking out listening to it. I got home and kind of fell apart and you know James comforted me and everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">And that was the rest of the day. Like this happened right after my appointment with you yesterday. and all I could do for the rest of the day was sit and read my book because every time I stopped and, you know, tried to actually get some work done or do anything, I would just fall apart again. (pause, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">sighing and sniffling). Yeah, I don't know how to live like this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">(long pause, sniffling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">It's like I spend so much of my energy not thinking about things. Well, I mean I can't deal with problems and then I don't have (sniffling) the attention that I ordinarily would have because, you know, a huge portion of my energy is going toward staving off this panic that's there all the time. [00: <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">04:17] (pause, sniffling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">This morning was going okay then I talked to Amanda on the phone and that was going okay. And she said she really thought that James and I should move to San Antonio and made a pretty good case for it. Just in terms of having a community. But I just couldn't handle that. (long pause) I'm kind of trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">to talk about anxiety and I feel like I've been trying to act like it's not as much of a big deal as it is, but it's just really devastating for me. I feel like it's crippling me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: (pause and sniffling) I'm so scared. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: (crying) I don't even know what I'm scared of, I'm just so scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099848\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: (crying, sniffling, long pause, labored breathing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I think some of what you're scared of is like an intensity of your anger at yourself for not being able to handle things you feel you should be able to handle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I think now sometimes you do want to kill yourself for that or kill yourself so you don't have to feel that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of just getting into huge trouble over something. (crying) I never know what it is I all have forgotten about that turned out to be really important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well, you probably don't remember this because it was sort of in the throes of the (inaudible at 00:08:39) stuff, but we had talked about how not being able to remember things can feel like not having control over things in the way you feel you should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I don't remember talking about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And so it can be something you blame yourself a lot for, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: (whisper) Yeah. Yeah. (long pause) James, you know, at the end of the day thanked me for taking care of myself. (sniffling) You know, for actually just saying, \"Well, I'm not going to be able to get anything done today. I just need to take a day off.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: But I felt so bad. I hate that. (long pause) Yeah, I hate myself when I'm like that. I don't know why I can't just get over it (pause) or push through it or something. (long pause, sniffling) Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen the rest of today. (long pause) (crying) I really hate this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(very long pause, sniffling, crying) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">And I hope. I mean at some point I have to listen to the rest of my messages. (laughs) I hope I'll be able to do that soon, but I don't know. (long pause) I know it's not that much to deal with, but it feels like too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">(long pause, crying, sniffling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">My Dad's coming tomorrow. We'll see how that goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: (long pause) Like I just want to hide. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I think you might worry that I won't react well if you hide for a little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: And then I'm going to say something to you that puts some other demand on you or limitation (ph) or burden that you can't bear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: No, not really. I just don't really have anything to say. (pause) I don't worry too much about you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: (pause, sighs, sniffling) I don't know. (banging noises, sniffling) Kind of not having much to say I think is working pretty hard not to lose it right now. So, I'm not really sure why. (pause) I mean it's just because my nose runs so much. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: (laughs) [That's okay.] (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (pause, sniffling) (sobbing) Just why is this happening to me? (pause) Why is this my life? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">(long pause, sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I'm so sorry that it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Thanks. (long pause, crying, sniffling) There's no reason for me to be so scared of everything. (pause) I just am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">(very long pause, sniffling, nose blowing) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">Here. I really don't want this. (pause, sniffling) I'm going to go home and I'm just going to keep going.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: And some of how when particular sorts of things happen they affect you in pretty (inaudible at 00:32:31) ways. But on the other side I'm inclined not to say so much about because you seem pretty maxed out with what you can bear. And I think that probably pretty well reflects the dilemma that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">you're in, which is (pause) the things that could help, whether it's understanding or task (ph) sort of things, or work, often feel like way too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. We went to dinner with Franco. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: And Franco's friends. And it went really well and I felt better while we were there. But I really didn't want to go. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: (long pause) Yeah. (inaudible at 00:34:33) Yeah, I really do want to hear the reasons because that wasn't really a rhetorical question, and I feel like I want to know. And in other ways I feel like they're not going to give any reasons that are good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Nothing adds up. So, I just want to stay away from it. (long pause, clearing throat, sniffling) I must have read four-hundred pages in the last twenty-four hours. 00:36:07<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: (long pause) And in other ways understanding doesn't necessarily help. (pause) So... (long pause) It's interesting. It's distracting sometimes. (long pause) It's hard for me to think about just the possibility that greater understanding wouldn't be helpful. I mean I feel like it's kind of one <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">of the foundational principles of life that like knowing is better. (laughs, sniffles) Yeah, knowing will help.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: I think when it comes to this stuff, I think you want to think knowing won't help, because I think you don't want to know. (pause) We kind of know where a bunch of the bodies are buried at this point. I mean, there's a lot more to learn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: But, no, you're right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: I feel like we sort of (inaudible at 00:40.27) a bunch and a number of things that have become really intolerable for you and some of why. And it's really hard to keep that in mind, I think. I mean (pause) like, the phone messages I think are actually maybe just the right metaphor. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">you know they're there, and it's terrifying because you know you may not be able to bear hearing them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Hm.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And if we wanted to think about it for a few minutes, because probably getting much more particular about what would be hard about hearing them. The message that you had a job interview, you know, and you never got (inaudible at :0042:50). Not far from stuff we've talked about. Again, I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">have a complete understanding, or I'm sure that there's a lot of important context that I don't have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: But (pause) yeah, I think you also I have no doubt that in moments when you're totally overwhelmed and upset, it feels like you have no idea what's going on or why this is happening. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: No, you're right. I know.

I don't think you do this (inaudible at 00:45:52) to mention intentionally, but I think it's sort of related. I think that a lot has happened recently and more historically in your life that sort of, in reality, adds to the impression that anybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">who thinks they have reasons doesn't know what they're talking about. Like (pause) it may not be (inaudible 00:46:43). I'm just going to throw it out there though anyway and we'll think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">So there may be times when your feelings are so intent and you come on, in your kind of subtle way, so strongly with them that you (inaudible) or kind of nearly empty reassurances from people who are sort of anxious and have a sense of your need and don't know what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: That then confirms your impression that they clearly have no idea what's going on or what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Have no idea.
