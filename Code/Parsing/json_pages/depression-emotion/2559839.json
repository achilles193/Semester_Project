This is it just feels like a classic morning for me in some ways. I was like packing last night and I was like, okay, I'm going to wear these jeans tomorrow and I put them somewhere and then this morning they were gone. Like totally gone and as it turns <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">out I put them in a drawer with my shirts which I found after like 15 minutes of like where are my pants? I don't know. I've been like looking around my apartment for things a lot more often than I typically do. It's like most stuff you don't end up like seeing from one year to the next but maybe that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">just me, but I broke my glasses a few days ago and I had a backup pair somewhere that was this pair and I like couldn't find them and I knew that I hadn't that I hadn't thrown them away because I was keeping them for this precise eventuality. And James knew he hadn't thrown them away but he didn't know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">where they were and I didn't know where they were and so I ended up looking everywhere in the apartment. My apartment is like about twice the size of this office, like its (laughing) not very big. And there are not many places. But like under the bed and I think I ended up like finding a lot of stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F4\">that I couldn't remember and also a lot of stuff that remembered but didn't want to think about. Like I found my stash of flash cards, like thousands of flash cards on tiny little pieces of cardboard tied together with rubber bands in a bag and like I found that bag. And then like I found this beautiful, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F5\">very nice hiking pack that I didn't remember or like I recognized it but I didn't know where it was from and I didn't know I had it and James was like, 'yeah, that was your birthday present last year.' So it's been like (whispers) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(PAUSE): [00:03:27 00:03:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: James really, really doesn't want to go to this wedding. And you know, he's been pretty like I don't know. I think he's doing as well as he can in terms of both being cheerful and cooperative and like not saying that he wants to go to the wedding because he doesn't want to go. I sort of want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">to go but I'm really tired from this week and am going to be more tired by the end of the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(PAUSE): [00:04:39 00:05:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: It's not like I'm melting down over little things but I think that's mostly because I'm like, I can't get to the point where I'm actually melting down over little things, (laughing) like I think it's actually worse. I'm kind of like frozen and sad and really upset and don't know what to do about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">it. Somehow I have to refill my prescription on Monday or by Monday and like I know that I'm not going to remember to do it. Like I know this. But like I could have done it today but I couldn't have really done it today. There's just not time. The last two months I've ended up like missing two or three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">days on my thyroid medication because I had run out on a Tuesday and then I can't get it until Friday and then I don't really want to move on Friday morning and like just managing my life There's also like four or five events in two days for this wedding, right? It's three days, but like it's just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">all parties like all the time. It's like sort of going to be great and I sort of might just skip some but I also can't skip some because like these are my cousins whom I love and I don't see I see them once a year, if that, and I don't know. James last night was like, 'do you think we can be the angry <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200274\">drunks this time?' And I was like, (laughing) 'totally.'<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559839\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">My first family wedding that James went to, my cousin, Oliver, at the end of the night picked him up and held him upside down. James let him because like Oliver had just gotten divorced and he was just in a really bad place, like he was shit-faced drunk and he really likes James and he really kind wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">to mess with him a lot and at the end of the evening he was like, 'I'm going to pick you up.' Oliver's like 5'6\", 5'7\" he's like a big guy for a little guy and James's like a little over 6' and James was sober and said like sure, why not, if it'll make you happy. So we're going to be that person.

You know, she doesn't say anything really remotely approximating my name but clearly she's trying. Apparently \"Y\" is really hard for small children, like it's one of the hardest consonants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's more like, \"tttt and then she gets the A and the N in there. She doesn't like, she doesn't babble that much or like she makes a lot of noise but she doesn't have a whole lot of different consonants. It's more like \"da, da, da, da, da\" and then like noise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(PAUSE): [00:13:43 00:13:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: She's getting bossier so we'll see how that goes. I think she really likes climbing up the stairs and when I don't want to climb up the stairs with her which is most of the time she gets really mad. Which is too bad she's really funny when she's mad. Like, 'I'm trying to take you seriously <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">but you're not even a year old and you're \"aarg.\" (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(PAUSE): [00:14:23 00:14:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I feel like I should work harder on coming up with things to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">(PAUSE): [00:14:52 00:15:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Like places to go to like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(PAUSE): [00:15:07 00:15:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don't know I like I feel like I'm running out of things to talk about because I am well I talked about all the things that are like sort of, pretty much bothering me and not the things that are really, really bad because I don't want to talk about things that are really, really bad and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">I also imagine that you don't want to hear about the things that are really, really bad and aren't actually the (whispers) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559839\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">(PAUSE): [00:16:36 00:16:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: And they're not anchored in anything.

So she went to work one day last week and was like I am going to have to cool it like he's going to resign today. He didn't end up resigning but like in the next month he's going to basically figure out what can be about it. So I don't know what's going to happen <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A53\">with her job which means that I don't know what's going to happen to my job. You know I think it's the sort of thing where like I think they're going to try to keep me so I don't think I'll have to look for another job but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">(PAUSE): [00:28:17 00:28:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: I could stay up worrying about that but there are so many other things. And that's something that's really, really not in my control. (Unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">(PAUSE): [00:28:50 00:29:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: The problem is that the more I like if I say I don't want to deal with something I feel like I just become more of a burden to other people. So it just doesn't look particularly James but then like things aren't great between us right now and I just don't want to deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">(PAUSE): [00:30:01 00:30:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Like it's sort of a new sensation for me of not wanting to just feeling that I just don't have the energy for that. Like I'm not thinking, 'oh no, we have to fix this right away.' And I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">(PAUSE): [00:30:42 00:31:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: We did finally make an appointment with a couple's counselor. I think he's going to be able to start like in September.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Who is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: I don't remember his name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: His office is in Andover. (Laughs) That doesn't narrow it down very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) Somebody whose name you got from (unclear)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm really glad about that. But I sort of feel like that will be the same thing as like it will be really good to have done and then, we'll have to do it, and then -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Like that's just how life is. (Whispers) It's hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">(PAUSE): [00:32:03 00:32:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I'm trying to think of (unclear) to say how hard it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">(PAUSE): [00:32:30 00:32:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I imagine it feels like you should just learn to deal with how hard it is. You shouldn't have to lay it on somebody else by talking about how hard it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559839\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel badly because it doesn't seem to me that it can possibly it doesn't seem like it is this hard for other people and I realize that like I don't know other people. I don't realize how hard it is for them but yeah I don't think other people want to quit life on a regular basis <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">because they just don't because of doing the dishes. And it doesn't make me feel like I don't feel I sort of feel sorry for myself but more of why can't I just deal with these things, these normal things. This is just how life is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Why can't I just deal with it? Because I don't think my life is actually harder than most people's.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Externally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Externally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like I just don't have what I should have to deal with it. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">(PAUSE): [00:34:36 00:35:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: So Selena's in this place where she has her favorite everything her favorite cup and her favorite bowl and her favorite clothes and so when the clothes she likes to wear are cleaned she just doesn't want to wear her other clothes and I sort of don't know what to do. I really know what you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">going through, Selena. I really understand. On the other hand, you're just going to have to wear these other clothes. Like that's just how it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">(PAUSE): [00:35:53 00:38:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I guess I it strikes me in different ways. One I do think you're feeling a bit that way with me like, 'doc, I don't want to fucking wear these clothes. I don't like the way things are. I don't like that I don't want to be on top of everything. I don't like that I want to quit and give <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">up. I don't like that I feel so burdened. Like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And so I also kind of imagine like there's something that's sort of historically referential there where Selena has you and her parents to kind of help her with that. She doesn't want to wear her clothes. We're going to sit there and get her to wear them somehow but you'll like help her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">You'll be more or less patient with her. You'll try different tactics and whatever and you'll see this as like, 'okay, this is what a three year old does. Like she's going through a phase, like boo-hoo. Like we'll try this, we'll try that. You know, some combination of trying to distract her, trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E72\">to force her, trying to bribe her, trying to do the laundry more, and just losing patience with her (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah, that's about right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And kind of like be in it with her to some extent. I don't know. I guess it makes me imagine that maybe you didn't have that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: I don't remember. I mean thinking more generally but I don't remember anyone talking to me about my clothes much. I mean that's what it feels like anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I guess part of where I'm part of what I was saying was like I think it and I mean it sincerely by the way, is like it feels to you like such a huge like kind of existential problem to not want to be doing these things. It's so burdensome and yet so dangerous not to do them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: And its sort of like my complete vanity about it is that she won't feel that way because she's got you and her parents to help her feel like this is livable or like survivable. It sucks but is not the end of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">(PAUSE): [00:42:24 00:44:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559839\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: So are you saying that a lot of my distress at not wanting to deal with my life and having to deal with my life and having to deal with my life comes through as I don't know how to resolve that or that I don't know how to resolve that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I guess what I'm saying is (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: (Crying?)
