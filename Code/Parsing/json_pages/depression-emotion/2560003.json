Remember coming to my house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: They had to say (inaudible at 0:00:02) left this morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: How'd it go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Well, I have no idea why I love something so stupid. It's like [my Hank, my dog Hank's name being dumb] (ph), right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:00:18).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I have a feeling like you could even like that about him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I do, I do. But he looks so much smarter when [Fanny and JoJo] (sp?) are over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: (Laughing) Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: He seems fine. Fanny is just... you can also get the sense that she's just discovering you for the first time, every time she sees you. She's like, oh, crap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Did you go upstairs? Oh, who's this? She's adorable, though. And you have to stop her sometimes from doing something really immature (ph), because she doesn't realize. She's like, I know I can get on top of this four inch wide strip of couch. I know I can get on top of it, but that's all I know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">[0:00:57] I know that I can't get forward or back right now, so that's concerning. But I am here. She just can't stand it. She's like, what am I going to do? I'm just going to pick you up is what I'm going to do, because you're an idiot. Yeah, I don't know, but I love her. So all three pups will sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">in the bed with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: And it's adorable. They do all cuddle up some. One's got her chin over my ankle. Another one's curled up right by head beyond the pillow. Another's along my side or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Affectionate little guys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, they'll just curl up next to you. I'm lying there, there's three dogs essentially on me. I'm like, this is really nice (chuckling). This is really nice. And it's... I don't know. I woke up this morning, I had Fanny and JoJo sleeping next to me, which was cute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just realized, oh, I've got two teddy bears essentially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Ah (laughing). [0:01:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, but they came and got them this morning. I'm like, oh well. Time to go. And it's interesting, because you see how people interact with dogs and the way they... dogs change behavior based on who they perceive as being in charge, right? So [at Anthony and Walter's house (ph) they're very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">much like, waaaa (sp?). We're going to jump up on you, we're going to freak out for 20 minutes when you get through the door, and constantly jumping up whenever we want and being like, aaaaaaahh (sp?), crazy, until eventually they calm down a bit. But then still they're like, hey, can I just crawl up <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200392\">on you without asking, just get up all in your face? They don't do that as much after a few days with us. They're more like, okay, so jumping up on stuff does not go well. We really hear about it when that happens, so I guess we won't do that anymore. And just they're like, oh, okay, I do have to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200393\">off the couch when you're eating. I understand this. I didn't realize, so thanks for telling me. [0:02:56] Yeah, so it's cute. And then to see all that immediately undone when they come to get them, I'm like, there they go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk) That's how dogs do, though. They're like, oh, this is you. I remember you. As long as you allow that behavior to occur, they're like, oh good. The rules are still the same with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560003\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they adapt to the leader, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, very quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: And they came into that [at the time when Barry] (ph) was recovering from multiple brain surgeries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Oh, it's that guy. CLIENT: Yeah, so there was a lot of (pause) uncertainty in the house. And dogs respond to that sort of stuff. You can see it in JoJo. JoJo's like, oh, I'm the boss of stuff...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: [Even though] (ph) she's not the boss of stuff. She's like, I'm pretty sure I'm the boss, and you're not the boss. And then Hank actually can be like, no, I'm the boss. I'm the boss of you guys, because I'm the biggest puggle (ph). So I don't know, let's do what I say, which works fine until <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">Hank gets bored and goes and lies down or something. [0:04:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) But he's the alpha of the three?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is hilarious, because he's so submissive in every other way. But it's cute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah, depends on the other side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, there's an order, and they're going to fall into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's an order, right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: It's how they're wired. (Chuckling) Okay, who's in charge, which is funny. Sometimes I think they think Ginny's (sp?) the disciplinarian and I'm the nurturer, because they... given the choice, most dogs except Alexi (sp?) will spend their time with me. No matter which dogs we have in the house, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">the dogs are like, oh, you seem cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: But especially with them staying over all weekend they're like, so we're going to be upstairs. [0:04:56] There's a bigger couch with more room and more comfortable stuff down here with you, Ginny. But see, Fred is upstairs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: So we're going to go on up there and all three of us curl into a spot for one human, on a tiny little love seat [by my computer] (ph). Yeah. So just adorable, just adorable. (Pause) And then you counterbalance that with this fact that we're all being watched, effectively. The beginning of that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">the very least, what do we do? It's like, well, we track metadata. It's like, that actually seems reasonable to a degree. And [then you put in... you look at... what you do with metadata] (ph), is (inaudible at 0:05:43) metadata is there's a track band for a month. And you can see where he was and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F2\">he was making calls of various length. And he was here, then he was over here...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, did you hear what Snowden said, the guy that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: No. [0:05:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: He's the leak, the guy that was the... that leaked the story, worked for... I think he was... either worked for NSA or he was contracted to. But he said, if I wanted to, I could look into anybody's phone or e-mail. It wouldn't have been a problem. And he just said it was so much of a conflict <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">of interest that I couldn't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I needed to break the story. Now he's in Hong Kong or something like that. So they can't get... even though he's in trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: But he so goes beyond just metadata, clearly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, there you go. So yeah, but we're all being watched. And Sam Harris is like, okay, but so what? (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560003\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) What did he say about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: He's like, well, what are you worried they're going to see? It's like, honestly, it's like, really, what's the problem? And I'm like, personal stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: That's exactly what it is, stuff that is just strictly personal and has no interest to anybody, and you just don't really want other people reading it. [0:06:56] It's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well, we were talking about Thursday... the Thursday, going on the wrong site, what if that is suddenly...? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And the only thing you can do is just avoid everything. But look at the point we're coming to, right? This technology will be in a couple of camps eventually. It'll be so easy to access.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: That's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Right? I mean... but then... and then there's... then what happens? We all live our lives in public all of a sudden, we all live our lives in public. So what does that do to a society, when all of a sudden everything about you can be known? What does that do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Well, it creates a society where people don't lie, or, if they do, they have to be incredibly good about it, has to take a lot of planning to really set it up over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and how safe is your own... what kind of private space can you have? [0:07:56] Where are the boundaries of you and public begin and end?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, who knows? And society will have to decide that, because that's happening. The tools exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: So... we're already being spied on. So... but then again, whatever. Right? Whatever. The government has no interest in me. It's never going to. So... and then people like Obama, I guess, who's fine, we basically trust him with that. But what about the next person, right? What are they going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">to be like? It's like, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what are they going to be like with my private life? Are they going to... what are they...? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that's the thing I think that we need to now address when people run for office. You're trusting this person with so much, so very much. [0:08:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. (Pause) No one can have much knowledge...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: But then (crosstalk) politicians' lives are forced to be open. They're like, well, we can't have corruption, so we have to just know everything about you. We want to know who you're talking to and where's your money coming from and what are you promising for that money? What's actually happening, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's almost like you've got to... there's got to be something preserved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Right, or it has to all be available to everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Or all available to everyone. But I guess that's an equalizer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Well, right. (inaudible at 0:09:37) oh God, I'm embarrassed about watching porn. It's like, don't be, because everyone watches porn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. If I got that on me and you've got that on me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right, it's like, yeah, so we all watch porn. Great, that's... now we get to know that. That's just in the open. Whatever, fine. And yeah, if we don't want to talk about it, we don't have to talk about it. [0:09:55] But it's known.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, as opposed to one person being a looker, the searcher, the other person being the searched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's the... no, we all know everything about each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560003\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Eventually that's where I think we're going to get, because really, how will you protect data anyway? And the question's going to increasingly become, why? Why do you need to protect data, all right? And that's (inaudible at 0:10:18) very interesting society we move into. On the subway today, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">there's a picture of a dude going like this. And it says, respect my space. And it's about sexual harassment on the subway. I'm like, well, no one's sexually harassing a white dude in a suit here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: What are we...? Come on, what's...? Come on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I've seen that picture. I'm like, is he the one harassing, or is he being harassed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, he seems to be like, hey, get off. Or maybe he's like, I'm going to touch you. Yeah, who knows? But (inaudible at 0:10:48). But in any case there's an app, a see something say something app, that you take a photo (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: For the Metro? Is it for the Metro? [0:10:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And you take a photo of the dude, and you report him for sexual harassment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: You're like, click. Hit the button, submit. I saw this dude doing this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: How about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Amazing. Now, that one's... really that's for anything. I mean, so... but on the one end I'm actually in favor of the principle behind that. On Twitter this happens all the time. People are like, oh, man, so and so did this incredibly sexist thing to me. Like, who? I don't want to make a big <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">thing of it. It's like, well, you do, though. I mean, it upset you. You want it to stop. Here's how to make it stop, you tell us who did it. And we're like, what are you doing? Why did you do this? And then that will fix it eventually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: I mean, if every time someone does something horrible, why are you doing that? And so there you go. By turning a light on these things, you can take power away from all sorts of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: So I don't know. We become this totally open society. [0:11:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Well, you're getting at, there's benefits, but there are... I mean, it's... yeah, it could take... (Pause) It could expose a lot of things that need exposing, but then there's also something about people's privacy that's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: But is there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: But it's the thing, is there? Is that just an irrational behavior, right? In terms of the species, do we need that level of privacy for the species?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: We're at a point where still our thoughts are basically our own, the details of them. With enough equipment we can monitor certain things about what your brain is doing, the choices it's making. So... but still for now the details of our thoughts are... maybe not forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Maybe not forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: I mean, maybe not. Maybe individuality is not the defining factor of our species in the end, right? [0:13:01] (Chuckling) Maybe eventually it's just hive mind, whatever. Plug it all in. It's all... we all become digital. All our bodies and souls if those exist die. And we can use visual... these <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">digital echoes of people who were once... who we were once. I don't know, that seems far out, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: Really that's plausible eventually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: If everything becomes public, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560003\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, really, if it comes down to it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: What is one's own then? Yeah, what is one...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well, what is one's one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: What is one individual...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: What one can do, I mean, it's what one can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: That's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: It's no longer what you know, because we can know anything, right? We can know anything. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah, what does that seem like to you, though? Does it seem...? [0:13:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: It seems like a society of creatives. It has a huge market of creatives, which is what is starting to happen. You have people just creating things and making money off those things. Cottage industry is back, right? People make independent games in their basement, and they make money off that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">People make Youtube videos and make money off that. People do these creative things people want to watch. We make content for you to consume. So we're all consumers. And more and more of us are becoming makers and then soldiers. So eventually that's it, right? Makers, consumers, and soldiers. (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF2\">This is awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: I got it from (inaudible at 0:14:52). It's black.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: I asked for a regular, and this is black. [0:15:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: It's not so bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: You asked for a regular, but you got black?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: We might have some milk. Do you put milk in it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Milk is fine. But it's all right. It's all right. Yeah, I'll pass on it. It is what it is. I hate that phrase, it is what it is. It just seems one of the worst phrases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: What...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: It is what it is. People use this to describe something that they don't like. It is what it is. I'm like, well, for now. Let's do something about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: It is what it is, and you're okay with that? No, I hate it. Well then why are we doing it? Then change it, then change it, then change it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: It seems like people don't get that, some people at least. [0:15:57] Like, oh, this is just the way it happened. Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: The... yeah, it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Just the apathy of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: The beta dog, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's true, it's the beta instinct, isn't it? Like, oh, I have stuff to do. This is what happened. Action and consequence. It comes to me, and I deal with it. Then it goes away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:16:24) I want Brave New World. That's what I want. I think that was great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: What, what, what about...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: Brave New World? You're genetically engineered to be happy. So, if you're smart enough to be an alpha, that's what you are. Only alphas are that smart, right? And only they have that drive to be alphas. And all (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: They're... I forget. They're genetically...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: They're all... everyone's genetically engineered to be happy in their class. So alphas make all the choices. Betas do all the paperwork. [0:16:54] Gammas do the blue collar stuff. And then deltas do the lowest blue collar stuff, the most menial labor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: But everybody's happy with their...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Everyone is happy. The guy, a delta, is like, this is the perfect level of challenge for me, is keeping these toilets clean. This is... this I can figure out. (inaudible at 0:17:14) I can figure out. And so... but they're happy. And then there's... if you're not happy still, there's a drug you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201271\">can take. Take as much as you want, or just take the drug soma. And you'll feel happy. And all you have to do is buy stuff. That's what the entire society is built around, is you go to work, they give you money, and you buy things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560003\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: They have all these rhymes that they use to guide their society. I only know a few. But... more stitches, less riches. [0:17:56] So the more stitches you see in someone's clothes, the less money they must have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: More stitches, less riches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah, so really you should just go buy new clothes, because they're not a lot of money, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Oh, is it patched?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: So if you have a lot of money you should spend it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah, and, if you're putting stitches in stuff, what's wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: It means that it's older.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, why don't you buy something new? Don't you have enough money? And so it's a society built on consuming, but everyone's happy. And when they're not they take a pill, and it makes them happy. (Pause) And not everyone lives in society. People live on the outside of it. They're generally trailer <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B1\">park people. And one of them, turns out, is... his mother got left behind on a trip out there and was pregnant with... anyway, so his parents are from the city. And he's been growing up on the outside. And he's been reading Shakespeare. And he loves Shakespeare. [0:18:53] And so he goes to visit the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B2\">city, and he's like, this is the worst possible reality. This is awful. And everyone's like, why? And people really just want to hear about him, like he's a novelty. And he keeps explaining why things aren't right by quoting Shakespeare, which of course is poetry. Much like they have their own poetry <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B3\">to guide their lives, he has different poetry. And that's the problem. That's the entire book is they have different poetry, and that's why they cannot be reconciled. And this is religion. They have different books, and they cannot be reconciled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Different poetry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that's... and so he kills himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: Because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: Because he feels... he's like, I went to the woods because I wanted to breathe deep and, blah, blah, blah, and to find out when I died that I had not really lived. Whatever that... I think Ralph Waldo Emerson quote that is, I think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Or Thoreau?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: Is it Thoreau?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's better with Thoreau. [0:19:58] Yeah, so he's... then he leaps off the fucking cliff. And all the media is like, that was weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: I wonder what that was about. Odd. And then there's the one alpha who goes to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: What was he disappointed about in the city? What did he [not like] (ph) in the city?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: That nobody had any individuality was his thing. Everything was born with these rules. And he had grown up wide open. And look what he was. He prizes individuality, but it caused him so much suffering, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Living on the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah. But he had been taught to treasure those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: Yeah. How about that? That's really something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And these other people (inaudible at 0:20:41) other things, and so they did. And so they were very happy, except for one dude kind of gets above it all and sees the cost of this happiness, is that, stuff like this other guy can't exist.

And so, oh God, he's in trouble, [living in 1984]. But then the head of the whole business, the whole deal, their president or whatever, is like, this happens to some alphas. You're very smart, and you get a perspective on something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F1\">and it makes you unhappy. So there's an island for you guys, where it's great. You go and do stuff, and you work on projects, pet projects, and... just with a bunch of other people. And you do whatever individual stuff you want to do. It's great. No problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: But they kind of account for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah. They're like, there'll be individuals. There'll be points where some of our smart people need to become individuals. So we'll send them to an island where they can be individuals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Did this guy... did the guy never get wind of this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: No, the wild guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I think his parents were betas. One was a beta, one was an alpha. Yeah, he was conceived, which is weird, because everyone else is grown in a tube.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: Okay. So no one's a mix, then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: No one's a mix. No one, unless... effectively.

I mean, you consider it the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D1\">wild, with the mom that you had, in some ways, in that you're now stepping into a place that's very...

One wife.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: Dogs that you take care and you're loyal to, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: That's true. And I'm not insane.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: And you're not insane, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: So that's nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I was thinking, it's still... I don't know if the right word's a culture shock, but I was thinking about the guy who comes from the wild and back in and goes, what's with this world, where everything's supposedly happy, and...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But he can't fit in. He can't fit in...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">CLIENT: Because... I mean, because it seems opposed to everything he has been taught to believe...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">CLIENT: And it [gets him depressed, he prizes individuality] (ph), that he is his own person. [0:23:57] And it's like, yeah, but how is that working out for you, really, because it's not. You look at it, he's... he wasn't really happy back at home. He's kind of an outsider there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: Was he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah, because he was a half-breed, all right? He was not happy, he was from outside. And his mother's insane because she is not... she grew up in this fucking perfect society, and now she's got to live in the trailer park.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560003\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: She's in the trailer park with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and she has no idea how to cope. And so she eventually gets taken back to the city, and she overdoses on soma. When she gets back, all she'll do is take soma. She's like, this is all I'm doing for the rest of my life, and then she dies. And it's like, she was so traumatized at being removed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B1\">from this, that she... it was so traumatic, that she couldn't deal with reality any more. [0:24:56] So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, yeah, so he doesn't feel like he's really a part of that, the outside. So he's looking for... he goes to the inside to look for something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but then there's nothing. He doesn't really fit anywhere. And... but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">CLIENT: And that's the thing. That's the story, because he couldn't be happy in that society because he wasn't raised in the society.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it's weird. Yeah, it's interesting. It's probably why I'm not a joiner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: I'm definitely not a joiner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking you can be in... if you're the alpha, you feel more individual, don't you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: I suppose...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">THERAPIST: I mean, you're a leader...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely, and... as much as you need to be. (Pause) But that's what we have already, is [being able to] (ph) produce happy, right? [0:25:59] Necessarily... janitors aren't necessarily happy doing janitorial work, even if that's the level of work they're suited for, which kind of seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B31\">unlikely. I'm sure most people can do more than janitorial work (chuckling), but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah, there's not these clear limits of what somebody's intellectually capable. It's almost culturally...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT: And what happens when the janitor jobs go away? Because they're so mind-numbingly boring, that we just gave them to robots (chuckling). This robot janitor is fucking... cleans his entire life, throughout the week, without rest. We don't need to pay him. There's an electricity bill for charging <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B71\">him, but eventually small fusion reactors... there you go. (inaudible at 0:26:53). [0:27:02] Who knows? And yet we're going to Mars. Right now people are making plans to colonize Mars and enacting them, and enacting plans to colonize Mars. Within ten years, we could have colonized Mars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">THERAPIST: You said it's a private venture, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, private venture. (Pause) Who owns Mars? That's a good question, who owns Mars? Who owns the moon? Whoever can get there first and set up a space, that's who.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">CLIENT: So yeah. Puggles and privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Puggles and privacy. [0:27:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:27:57)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">THERAPIST: It appears very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah. Same way with puggles. We were packed with puggles. Any time you turn around, there will be three puggles starting at you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">CLIENT: Like, so what are we doing now? We're going to the kitchen. Cool. Going to the kitchen, that's awesome. That's awesome. You doing stuff in there? Yeah. All right, cool. We're just going to have a seat. (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't want the government in my bedroom, but puggles are okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, puggles seem fine, yeah. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) A lot of things changing. (Pause) I'm thinking that'll change politics (pause), once it's like, you have people who are running for office that could be in a position to know anything about us that you'd want to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560003\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Hmm. [0:29:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">CLIENT: It seems weird. What if we want to know stuff about you? It's like, well, there should be open information, right? If you run for... then what happens? You run for public office, you just have to open that stuff up? This is who I am, this is what I do. This is who I am. This is who I'm taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D31\">money from and why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">CLIENT: Total accountability all of a sudden. What would that look like? One of the problems with the Internet is no accountability, and so that's going to change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, would it be... would being public make it more... people more responsible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">CLIENT: Well, eventually there will just be you, right? Oh, your Facebook account, your Twitter account. No, it's just you and your presence on the web and your account. [0:29:57] That's who you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Kind of seen by anybody at any time, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">THERAPIST: If you want...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">CLIENT: If this... with certain details, like for security stuff, like, oh, perhaps location is on a friends list only, where people [who've had other relationships] (ph), what do you mean? What do you mean your husband won't give you his location tracking? That's interesting. Why? That's weird. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E31\">would seem like you'd want to know where he is in case something happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">CLIENT: It's important. So why doesn't he want you to know where he is? That's weird. At 2:00 today your location thing turned off for a couple of hours. That's weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">THERAPIST: What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">CLIENT: What do you mean, that's weird? Did you turn it off? No, my phone [was on the fritz] (ph). You'd better get that fixed, yeah? That's broken, clearly. So what happens? That's... what happens when...?

What are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EF\">CLIENT: Right. That's what it's going to be. But then look at 1984.

(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Just so he knows that he isn't being watched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, but... I mean, but there it is. That's the reality of it, and what are we going to do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

It's... but that's the early 70s. They... Hackman I think works for the CIA or something like that.

[0:37:58] Then it can be used against him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that movie Enemy of the State was a sequel that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">CLIENT: Oh, okay, interesting. It's just... I don't know, man. (Pause) Well, it all comes down to, what can I do about it anyway? And the answer is nothing. The answer is nothing. (inaudible at 0:38:21) really, logically, nothing. Keep my mouth shut, go to work, buy stuff, plan to retire. Keep my nose <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202631\">clean. Boom, there you go.

And there's already a judge found selling children to prisons. He would... this was in the south. He had sold people. They overturned 4,000 convictions when they caught him for this, because he would just convict people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202671\">[0:38:57] This prison, they needed to make quota, and they'll give you a cut...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">CLIENT: If you send people, so, yeah.

So... but at the same time I have to believe that the arrow of history turns toward liberty. Isn't that what it says, is the... is that there is a basic decency of human beings which will erode this. I mean, there will always be people who <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202731\">abuse things, but we will continue to see our way forward. (Pause) Yeah. And Obama's not going for your guns very hard any more. [0:40:00] He was talking about it for a while, but there's not a lot of support for it. Rather, there is a lot of support for it. But the state (inaudible at 0:40:07)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">CLIENT: Don't want to do it.

[0:41:03] (Pause) Drastically. (Pause) Yeah. I see all <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2027F1\">these jobs.

[0:42:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">CLIENT: Is to actually make things, because I do believe that.

That's a... people will always need (inaudible at 0:42:25), it's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F1\">until the robots can do sympathy better than we can. So... but in that case, great! Seriously, when we have robots that can do all those things better than us, that's fine. We've won. We've created a society of robots that will just take care of us. And that's what happens. Who works the mines? The <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F2\">robots work the mines. What do we do? We sit around. We consume the stuff that robots make for us. Awesome.

That's what hampers me. And only a bit, because really it means that I make prototypes.

We've made a ton <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202A71\">of cards. [0:45:02] Now we're to the point where we need to do development of playing with these cards.

Stephen has it, and he has a whole [PowerPoint program] (ph). The plan is, he's going to make a stripped down version of all the cards so I can print them out, because he's got [colored art in his] (ph). I'm like... that's also prohibitively expensive <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202AB1\">to go through that much color ink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AF\">CLIENT: I kind of wish I'd bought that laser printer back when I had the job. It would only do black and white, but that's fine. Laser printers are so much more efficient. (Pause) In any case, maybe that's what I should do next. [0:45:57] Maybe I should just put my head down, start creating content, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202AF1\">(inaudible at 0:46:02), be a good little drone (pause), find individuality that exists in what I create.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Ah.

These things <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202BB2\">are fun, I enjoy them, so... and people go, oh, nerd. I'm like, what does that even mean? So I really kind of push that, like, are you going to be an asshole about this? And, if so, why? What do you gain? Honestly. And that's such a great question for assholes.

It's a combination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F7\">CLIENT: Well, but shame is the fear of being judged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FB\">CLIENT: Shame is the fear of being judged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FD\">THERAPIST: Being looked at and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FF\">CLIENT: And because it works when you are given the thought, when it's planted in your mind that the person judging has power to do so. And that's what's so fascinating. Once you reject that the leaders of the church have any sort of connection [to find] (ph), that is a huge weight off your shoulders. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202FF1\">It's like, well, now who cares what they think? Honestly, who cares what they think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20301\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20303\">CLIENT: But still there's enough of it in your brain...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20305\">THERAPIST: The eye is internal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20307\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Now that it's in the brain, well, it's a step away from them, but not from yourself, not from what's been planted...

[0:52:55] And it's what we're seeing now. It's like, why is weed illegal? God, I don't know. Do you know? No, I don't know. It doesn't seem... is there a good reason? I can't think of one. Okay, let's just fix that. Can't we make money off that somehow? Isn't there...? <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2031B2\">Isn't it an incredibly valuable product as a country we could be selling?
