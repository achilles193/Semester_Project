And I\u2019ve been avoiding spending too much time calling and writing people and letting them know that it\u2019s 90\u00ba.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">INTERVIEWER: That\u2019s very nice of you.

Yeah. And trying to figure it out. So it was really fun. Yeah. We had some interesting twists and turns from the get go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">INTERVIEWER: Do tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">RESPONDENT: Like three days into the trip Dr. Smith\u2026 I don\u2019t know, did you hear this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">INTERVIEWER: I heard he got sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">RESPONDENT: Well, he came with like bronchitis, and it just kept getting worse and worse. And eventually he\u2019s like, you know, in more serious shape than just like bronchitis. So they end up taking him to the hospital. And I didn\u2019t know his personal background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">RESPONDENT: But he\u2019s like inches away from like renal failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">INTERVIEWER: Oh God. I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">RESPONDENT: So he ends up\u2026 I mean, they brought him back today. He spent the last, you know, two-plus weeks of his trip sitting in a northern Indian hospital\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">INTERVIEWER: Right. [2:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">RESPONDENT: \u2026 on dialysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">INTERVIEWER: Oh God. That\u2019s awful. In a place\u2026 You know, you can imagine how isolating that would be. You don\u2019t speak the language, you\u2019re not home, you\u2019re having serious medical issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">INTERVIEWER: That\u2019s bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">RESPONDENT: So, I mean, that dynamic happened. Dr. Peterson got sick for a day or two. Just the kind of other little ups and downs you sort of expect. And then there\u2019s the protest going on over in India.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">INTERVIEWER: Okay. Now, I hadn\u2019t heard about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">RESPONDENT: Pro-democracy\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s pro-democracy\u2026 Anyway, there\u2019s like the\u2026 when we get over there, there\u2019s clearly this hubbub that this large group in Mumbai is going to shut down the city.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">INTERVIEWER: Okay. \u201cWelcome to our city!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">RESPONDENT: And the first part of the trip, the first week, we\u2019re in the northern part, and the second and third week we were doing these workshops in Mumbai. And Carlson\u2019s hotel is in one location where the workshops are, and the rest of us kind of put up in this hotel are in another location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">INTERVIEWER: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">RESPONDENT: And it becomes apparent that\u2026 you know, the first week we\u2019re doing just fine, but it was\u2026 the start of the second week was the date that they were going to shut down the city. And one of the spots, there\u2019s like seven locations around the city that they were going to block traffic and shut <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">down the city, and it would have been between our two hotels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">INTERVIEWER: Was if far\u2026 those two hotels, were they far apart?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">RESPONDENT: No. Geographically, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561990\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">RESPONDENT: Depending on the traffic, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">INTERVIEWER: Okay, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">RESPONDENT: You know, traffic over there is insane. But they ended up moving us out into the country to this rural resort for the last week, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, well that worked out.\u201d [laughter] So being in Mumbai for a week was enough for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">RESPONDENT: It was just like\u2026 it was too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">INTERVIEWER: Okay. Too much stimulation\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">RESPONDENT: Too much stimulation, too much\u2026 too many people.

I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">INTERVIEWER: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">RESPONDENT: I remember taking a walk away from the hotel just kind of exploring a little bit, and I got to this huge intersection, and there was no Indian person there for me to watch and follow. You know, it\u2019s like, okay, when do I walk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">INTERVIEWER: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">RESPONDENT: And it was like this huge bank of cars just sitting over here, and I\u2019m like, nope. I just turned around and walked back. [5:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">RESPONDENT: I\u2019m like, I am not walking out in the middle of this. We actually had one of the doc students just got clipped in the back of her leg by one of those little motorcycles that are running over there, and it was just like, okay, we got to be careful here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">INTERVIEWER: A very interesting multi-cultural experience where you can learn what it\u2019s like to be isolated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">RESPONDENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">INTERVIEWER: And don\u2019t know any of the rules. And I always find it very helpful\u2026 I think I told you, my husband is European.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">RESPONDENT: If you did I may have forgotten that, but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">INTERVIEWER: Okay. And he\u2019s only been in the United States for maybe three and a half years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">RESPONDENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">INTERVIEWER: And even though our language is very common, he frequently says\u2014and I\u2019ve heard this from clients from other places\u2014how hard he has to think over here, because everything he knows to be true, all the rules are different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">INTERVIEWER: Even though at least, you know, there\u2019s some semblance of speaking the same language. And he says, \u201cWhen I go home, I don\u2019t have to think very hard.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">INTERVIEWER: And here\u2026 And so you can kind of see where\u2026 I felt like that in Italy. Like I was isolated, I didn\u2019t speak the language. So I think that your experience over there\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">RESPONDENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">INTERVIEWER: \u2026 is pretty applicable to everything you\u2019re going to do as a counselor, because you realize what it\u2019s like to be the only lonely out there and you\u2019re the one not knowing the rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. And it was good to have those experiences, it was good to be feeling those kind of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s like, \u201cOh.\u201d You know, just being in that place of being able to watch that while it\u2019s up. And it\u2019s like, one day at some point it\u2019s like, okay\u2026 yeah, I don\u2019t think this is necessarily home sickness, but I\u2019m ready to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah. [laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">RESPONDENT: Whatever that feeling is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">INTERVIEWER: More things that are familiar and make sense, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, whatever you want to call that. And then other little expectations you had, bringing\u2026 It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, Indian food, I love Indian food.\u201d And then it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m a vegetarian, this\u2019ll be great.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561990\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">INTERVIEWER: You like the American version of the Indian food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">RESPONDENT: Meanwhile, we get over there, it\u2019s like those people put meat in everything. [7:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">INTERVIEWER: Do they really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. So the irony is that in the States, when you go to like a steak place or something and you\u2019re like the oddball vegetarian, they don\u2019t know what to do with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">INTERVIEWER: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">RESPONDENT: They crack open the bag of frozen broccoli, carrots and cauliflower and they dump it in and throw some little sauce on it. And I\u2019m like\u2026 I got that meal two or three different times in India. I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">INTERVIEWER: Wow. Wow. I wouldn\u2019t expect that. That\u2019s funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">RESPONDENT: So\u2026 But yeah, yeah. I mean, just it was a great\u2026 It was great the first week. It was like, we were on this bus tour\u2014not on buses, van tour\u2014everything was pre-laid out, you know, what we\u2019re doing, the schedule, where we were eating, where the hotels were. It\u2019s like, I didn\u2019t have to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">for an entire week. It was like being in grade school again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">INTERVIEWER: Okay. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">RESPONDENT: Just hop on the van, you know, goof around with the people in the back of the van. And in the process made friends with some of our Indian hosts. And I came back with three or four people\u2019s e-mails that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll probably keep some sort of relationship going with, and that was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">fun. And really trying to dig in and get a sense of what it means to be Indian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">RESPONDENT: You know, what\u2019s it like to be an everyday Indian. And, I don\u2019t know, I got what I got out of it, my interpretation of that. So no, it was just really\u2026 yeah. It was really great to just be in that place of like, yeah, I don\u2019t have to think. Going to Mumbai kind of changed everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah. That sounds like when of the kind of real multi-cultural experience began.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah. And then it was like, okay, now you\u2019re on your own and you got to try to figure this thing out. And one of the first things we did, a group of five of us I think, we wanted to do a little bit of sightseeing and try to get down to the palace. So we thought, hey, we\u2019ll take a taxi. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF1\">So we have the bellman from the hotel get us a taxi. Well, he didn\u2019t get us a taxi, he got us a couple of tuk tuks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">INTERVIEWER: What\u2019s a tuk tuk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s a three-wheeled open scooter kind of a thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s like a supped up golf cart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">INTERVIEWER: And you have to drive it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">RESPONDENT: No, no, no, there\u2019s a driver.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">INTERVIEWER: Okay. All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">RESPONDENT: A couple of drivers. So he puts us in these tuk tuks, and it\u2019s like a Disneyland ride or something. Only there\u2019s reality involved here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">INTERVIEWER: Sure. [10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">RESPONDENT: It was like, \u201cWhat the hell are we doing?\u201d So we get away from the hotel, I don\u2019t know how far, 10 or 12 blocks, who knows, kind of turning here and there, and the tuk tuk, they pull over to the side. And the driver hops out and he goes, \u201cSo we\u2019re going to stop now at a couple of different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D31\">places.\u201d So it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s the scam.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">INTERVIEWER: But we don\u2019t want that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. They\u2019re going to take us to a jewelry outlet store, and they\u2019re going to take us to a tailor. And then, you know, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to stay. Like five minutes, just stay five minutes. See we get a\u2026\u201d and he pulls out this card \u201c\u2026we get a stamp if we take visitors there for free gas.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D71\">So we do that. And then that makes us a little bit lighter. Then we\u2019re going to take a water taxi across the river to get to the palace.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561990\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">RESPONDENT: Well, they take us to this place, and there\u2019s no water taxi there. It\u2019s a tour boat. I mean, you\u2019re going to get an hour tour now on the river.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">INTERVIEWER: [laughing] Whether you want it or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">RESPONDENT: I mean, it\u2019s kind of like\u2026 you know, because you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">INTERVIEWER: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">RESPONDENT: You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s like you would have just said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going here, we\u2019re going to go to the water taxi.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">INTERVIEWER: But you can\u2019t advocate for yourself if you don\u2019t speak the language, and it\u2019s not your rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah. And so it\u2019s like, okay. So we paid way too much for a tour down the river. And then the boat goes past the dock for the palace and then turns up this tributary, and we\u2019re heading down this area where it\u2019s like, \u201cWhere are we going and why are we here?\u201d And finally I\u2019m just like\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">I just keep looking at the driver, the female driver, and it\u2019s like, \u201cTurn it around back to the palace.\u201d I mean, I kept saying \u201cpalace.\u201d And finally she turned the boat around and went back. So we get there and we get to the dock and we finally get over to the palace just in time for the palace to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E72\">close. [laughs] [12:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">INTERVIEWER: You didn\u2019t get to see it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">RESPONDENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">INTERVIEWER: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">RESPONDENT: Not that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">RESPONDENT: But in the meantime of course we had the prime lesson in getting around, and at least had this funny story to tell about being shook down all the way through Mumbai.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">INTERVIEWER: Well, if it makes you feel better, I got off the plane in Italy and this English-speaking cab driver walked up to me, and he was in a long line of cabs so I thought it was legit, and took me for twice what it would be. And mid-way through I thought, I\u2019m definitely being screwed here. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F51\">from Detroit, I know this is not the way it\u2019s supposed to work, but what can I do, you\u2019re in it now. So I think it\u2019s part of the tourism experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m sure that that kind of thing happens every day of the week and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">INTERVIEWER: Every day in every country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">RESPONDENT: \u2026 twice on Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">INTERVIEWER: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">INTERVIEWER: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">RESPONDENT: You know. And then the whole haggling experience at the markets, all those kind of things. So it was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">INTERVIEWER: It sounds like a full trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">RESPONDENT: It was. I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">RESPONDENT: Lots of experiences. I\u2019m really glad that we ended out at the resort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Did you get to connect with some of your classmates at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. The other interesting development for this trip, and it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m waiting to see if like, well, that was a really good idea in India, let\u2019s see if it develops back here in the States or if it just stays over there, I\u2019m not really sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">RESPONDENT: But since Dr. Smith was out of the picture after like three days Dr. Peterson and I are the only two males on this trip. And he and I were able to speak the Buddhist speak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">INTERVIEWER: Oh, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Because he has a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561990\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">RESPONDENT: So we connected really on this trip. And I had volunteered to give a presentation at one of his workshops. And I\u2019m thinking, well, I know this is kind of a gutsy thing, because it\u2019s like I\u2019m a master\u2019s student, and his doc students are there. But he just opened it up to anybody, it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">if you want to volunteer to make a presentation. And I said, \u201cSign me up.\u201d And I said, \u201cHow about I talk about the MBSR program?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">RESPONDENT: He said, \u201cGreat.\u201d So I did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">INTERVIEWER: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">RESPONDENT: So about half-way through the trip he\u2019s starting to talk to me about like, \u201cWe need to figure out how to get you into the doc program.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">INTERVIEWER: I was just\u2026 you know, it\u2019s so funny that you say this. I was just thinking that that would be a good next move for you. Silas\u2019s a good guy\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">INTERVIEWER: \u2026 and if he\u2026 he usually doesn\u2019t say things, at least in my experience, that he doesn\u2019t mean. So how did you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">RESPONDENT: Well, it kind of took me by surprise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">RESPONDENT: I mean, it kind of was like, I don\u2019t know what to do with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">RESPONDENT: So I talked to other doc students about it, and talked to a couple of the other profs that were there. [15:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">RESPONDENT: And I was like kinda getting a feel for how legit is this, what is this offer? And it\u2019s like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">INTERVIEWER: Well, let\u2019s stop for a second and go back. So your first reaction was, it sounds like, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just a master\u2019s student. And then your second reaction was you weren\u2019t sure how legit it was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, that\u2019s\u2026 I didn\u2019t know Peterson well enough at that point to be able to know. It\u2019s like, well, is he just kind of patting me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">INTERVIEWER: What, blowing smoke?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">RESPONDENT: \u2026 patting me on the head and making me feel\u2026 giving me some confidence, encouragement or whatever, using Adlerian speak, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">INTERVIEWER: Why do you think he would do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">RESPONDENT: Maybe I put myself in that position. It\u2019s like, okay, if I had a person doing a presentation, (a) that I didn\u2019t know that well, and was a master\u2019s student or whatever, it\u2019s like, you know, that\u2019s how I would want to be. Not insincere, but I would want to be encouraging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">INTERVIEWER: Well, but you can\u2026 he can be encouraging without saying I think you should go on for a doctor program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, I suppose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">INTERVIEWER: He could say, you know, I think you did a good job, or I think that\u2019s interesting, and let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">INTERVIEWER: But what I find very interesting is your first reaction is to question the legitimacy of his seeing something in you that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. I suppose it\u2019s probably a self-confidence thing coming back on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">INTERVIEWER: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">INTERVIEWER: Well, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re surprised. You know, I guess I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re always surprised when other people see talent in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">RESPONDENT: Mm. I think that it\u2026 Well, it may be that, but I think that there\u2019s also a piece of like, \u201cDo you understand that I\u2019ve barely gotten through this master\u2019s degree program? I don\u2019t know how I can legitimately walk\u2026\u201d You know, what kind of games or what kind of things are going to have to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201531\">done in order\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">INTERVIEWER: Why would it be a game, Seamus?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s like, well, there\u2019s K accreditation here. And then it\u2019s like\u2026 it seems to me like some backroom deals are going to have to happen in order to make this really work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20156-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20156-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561990\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">INTERVIEWER: Wait a second.

You mean for you to become a doctoral student?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">RESPONDENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">INTERVIEWER: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">RESPONDENT: Well, it\u2019s like my first master\u2019s degree is in religious education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">RESPONDENT: And if you look at that it\u2019s like there\u2019s not a whole lot\u2026 there\u2019s nothing over here that interfaces or looks like any of the master\u2019s degree programs that are [K-crep?] class in the master\u2019s degree program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">INTERVIEWER: Why do they have to be correlated at all?

And I suppose that it\u2019s\u2026 you know, I think that I went down this road once before, but sort of that sense of feeling like I\u2019m the imposter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">INTERVIEWER: Okay, can you talk a little bit more about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s like I haven\u2019t even seen my first client yet, and we\u2019re talking about the doctoral program?

And it\u2019s like part of it is just we\u2019re going to go up there and talk about it later this afternoon and try to talk with Fred and figure out what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201871\">I\u2019m going to need to do, what kind of classes I\u2019m going to need to take.

So I understand what you mean. Let me see if I can give you an example that might make things clearer. So my undergrad degree was from the Northern Illinois University. When I was applying to graduate school there were two types of doctoral PHC programs at the time that I was applying <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C51\">for. One was you can apply for just a master\u2019s program and get your master\u2019s degree and then go on and apply for a doctoral program. And so you had a program where you applied at a doctoral program and you get your master\u2019s degree along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">RESPONDENT: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">INTERVIEWER: Because they want to do your whole educational process. They took a few students who already had a master\u2019s degree, but most of us did not. And we received a master\u2019s degree. You already have a master\u2019s degree, and you have some master\u2019s level classes. So my guess is in speaking with Silas <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C91\">they\u2019re trying to figure out a way where you still get some of your master\u2019s courses under your belt, and then instead of finishing the master\u2019s degree go on for the doctoral degree because you already have a master\u2019s degree, even though it\u2019s not necessarily in counseling psychology. It\u2019s done a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561990\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">RESPONDENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">INTERVIEWER: It\u2019s not that big a deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">RESPONDENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">INTERVIEWER: It\u2019s not\u2026 you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s just that\u2026 not part of my worldview\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">INTERVIEWER: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">RESPONDENT: \u2026 and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">INTERVIEWER: But if somebody told you now after this trip\u2026 you know, if you came back with the idea that you were going to finish your master\u2019s degree and go on for a doctoral degree, this doctoral program, would you be surprised?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">RESPONDENT: No, I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">INTERVIEWER: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">RESPONDENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">INTERVIEWER: So this isn\u2019t actually that much different.

I don\u2019t really find it\u2019s a mark of intelligence. I know brilliant people who never finished high school, and people who have doctorates that aren\u2019t that bright. It\u2019s not that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202091\">It\u2019s kind of about\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020B\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s an endurance test.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">INTERVIEWER: It\u2019s an endurance test, but it\u2019s also specializing in an area of knowledge, and it means you can do different things.

And there is sometimes a difference in skill level, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D1\">there\u2019s really not.

So I set up a blog and I just posted a few pictures and some thoughts about being in India when I was there. So people were able to keep up a little bit with me. And I did a few face-time calls <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203631\">when I was over there and that kind of thing. Yeah, you know, I\u2019ve kind of jumped back into regular life, and there\u2019s regular schedules going on. And my daughter came home Sunday.

But I think that the mindfulness piece I think is enough of an interest for Silas that I think that\u2026 you know, I think he <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203871\">has a stake in wanting to keep something like that going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20389\">INTERVIEWER: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2038B\">RESPONDENT: For me, I had plenty of time to think about it while I\u2019m over there and I\u2019m thinking\u2026 you know, I had a discussion, or I started a conversation with Perry Tulley and\u2026 oh, shoot, I lost her name. I think she\u2019s in social work. But they\u2019re involved in mindfulness here at the college. And there <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2038B1\">was discussion of that they had thought about trying to put together a mindfulness institute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2038D\">INTERVIEWER: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2038F\">RESPONDENT: But they were just kind of feeling discouraged about it and didn\u2019t really know how to make it happen.

I guess if <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203CD1\">I could sort of give you something it would be\u2014and I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014but thinking about learning how to trust yourself consciously. Because I think you trust yourself on an unconscious level, because there\u2019s no way you could have just left one career, picked up another career, done well, left the <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203CD2\">other career, in a mindful intelligent way without having some trust in yourself, without having some planning, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203CF\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203D0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203D1\">INTERVIEWER: Because, as I said before, none of these were impulsive decisions, and they were all in line with an already developed skill set that you decided to develop more. That bespeaks of confidence, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203D2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203D3\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203D4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203D5\">INTERVIEWER: I wish you could trust yourself consciously, make a conscious effort. You can still be scared, you can still be anxious. Right. Because if you weren\u2019t, then I\u2019d be concerned, because you don\u2019t exactly know what you\u2019re getting into. Seeing clients professionally changes all of us all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203D51\">time. Right. Who you are as a counselor ten years ago is different ten years from now, as it should be. But if you could trust yourself consciously you might have more joy with what you\u2019re doing. Because you know what you\u2019re doing. You do. So it wouldn\u2019t really matter if you had decided, \u201cI\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203D52\">to go for my doctorate.\u201d on day one of the master\u2019s program, or when you graduated with your master\u2019s degree.

Or where did that come from? You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203E4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203E5\">INTERVIEWER: Well, I think that definitely deserves some thought, because it is one of the themes of our work together. But I\u2019m imagining your dad as a mechanic. And you got your brains from somewhere. I mean, I imagine your parents were pretty bright people. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203E7\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203E8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203E9\">INTERVIEWER: And being a mechanic is a different kind of talent. That\u2019s all. But it involves some intelligence. But he it sounds like didn\u2019t feel good about the type of intelligence he had, which is why he had to put down the college boys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203EA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203EB\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203EC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203ED\">INTERVIEWER: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203EF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F1\">INTERVIEWER: So some of it you probably earned honestly. Right? Because when we don\u2019t feel good about ourselves we tend to just pass it on down the line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F3\">RESPONDENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F5\">INTERVIEWER: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F7\">RESPONDENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F9\">INTERVIEWER: And then you were a fish out of water because you weren\u2019t going to be a mechanic, you weren\u2019t going to be a laborer, you were going to be a college boy, and that\u2019s not necessarily what we do in this family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203FA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203FB\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203FC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203FD\">INTERVIEWER: Right. And so instead of\u2026 And I can see echoes of that. My grandmother, my paternal grandmother had a college degree, but my paternal grandfather had a sixth grade education. And couldn\u2019t read well, but could do complex mathematics in his head. So he was very bright. And my dad, who had <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203FD1\">a college education and went on to get a master\u2019s degree, a doctorate, whatever, they had nothing to talk about. Because my grandfather was like, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Right. But his own insecurity didn\u2019t allow him to really be supportive and understand what my father was doing. But those brains came from <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203FD2\">somewhere. [50:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203FE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203FF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.

Yeah, and then my mind was just jumping to, \u201cOh, well, look at that. Now isn\u2019t that kind of what\u2019s going on in your marriage relationship?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20408\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20409\">INTERVIEWER: Explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2040A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2040B\">RESPONDENT: That, you know, it\u2019s like\u2026 you know, whether it be\u2026 you know, whatever.

What it factor do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204B2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204B3\">RESPONDENT: I think that probably when I feel like I could be doing a better job than whoever happens to be in front of the\u2026 you know, it\u2019s that I\u2019m intuiting that they really don\u2019t want to be there, or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204B4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204B5\">INTERVIEWER: Okay. So what do you call that, that\u2026 what you have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204B6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204B7\">RESPONDENT: Well, I think\u2026 you know, I know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204B8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204B9\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204BA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204BB\">RESPONDENT: \u2026 that there are just some people that have the talent to be able to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204BC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204BD\">INTERVIEWER: The talent, or maybe the passion or the energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204BE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204BF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204C0\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204C1\">INTERVIEWER: So when you\u2019re up there\u2026 you know, when you were telling me about orchestrating things, seeing talented kids, that requires energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204C2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204C3\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204C4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204C5\">INTERVIEWER: Right? Or passion. Passion is just another way of saying energy, it\u2019s a particular type of energy. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204C6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204C7\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204C8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204C9\">INTERVIEWER: So I think good teachers have a passion for what they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204CA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204CB\">RESPONDENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204CC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204CD\">INTERVIEWER: It looks different, depending on who you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204CE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204CF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204D0\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204D1\">INTERVIEWER: Right? But they\u2019re energized by what they\u2019re doing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204D2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204D3\">RESPONDENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204D4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204D5\">INTERVIEWER: \u2026 and they\u2019re passionate about their subject area. Right. So is that why you\u2019re saying you think I could pick it up in ten minutes and do a better job, because is that the it that you\u2019re talking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204D6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204D7\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, I think it\u2019s the it of being able to connect with people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204D8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204D9\">INTERVIEWER: All right, but that is one of the things that drives you. And that is why you\u2019re not an imposter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204DA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204DB\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204DC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204DD\">INTERVIEWER: You know, I think in our early work together I said, you know, you\u2019re a deep guy, and connecting to people is important to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204DE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204DF\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204E0\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204E1\">INTERVIEWER: Right. You\u2019re not an unemotional man at all. And so that is the part that makes you not an imposter. [pause] Not in this environment. [1:00:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204E2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204E3\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. [pause] Yeah. I think that\u2026 I think I see that. You know, certainly after this trip I\u2019m feeling less of those\u2026 you know, that insecurity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204E4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204E5\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204E6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204E7\">RESPONDENT: You know, about the program, and feeling like\u2026 To a certain degree I have to admit that I\u2019ve been kind of bored with the graduate level classes that I\u2019ve been taking so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204E8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204E9\">INTERVIEWER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204EA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204EB\">RESPONDENT: It\u2019s like, yeah, this has not been really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204EC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204ED\">INTERVIEWER: Well, but it\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult for you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about being difficult. It\u2019s about what are you going to take with what you\u2019re doing and channel it into the clinical realm. Right? So I don\u2019t think something has to be difficult to be challenging, or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N204ED1\">has to be difficult to change us. It may not be academically difficult for you at all. And you may find that the doctoral level classes are\u2026 they may be work intensive, but not necessarily academically difficult. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204EE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204EF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204F0\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204F1\">INTERVIEWER: But that\u2019s not the measure of anything, right. It\u2019s kind of like, what are you going to do with this information?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204F2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204F3\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204F4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204F5\">INTERVIEWER: You know, how are you going to be changed by it, how are you going to change it, and what kind of counsel\u2026 like where are you going to channel it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204F6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204F7\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N204F8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204F9\">INTERVIEWER: Right. So what are you going to do with it? So I don\u2019t think it\u2026 I don\u2019t think you have to feel like you\u2019re being challenged to death academically to kind of take in the knowledge and then to do something with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P18-N204F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"17\"><span data-id=\"P18-N204F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":19,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561990\" data-realpage=\"19\" data-page=\"19\">\n<p data-id=\"P19-N204FA\"><span data-id=\"P19-N204FB\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. That\u2019s a good point. I think this probably needing to rethink or re-envision what a master\u2019s program\u2026 what a doc program looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N204FC\"><span data-id=\"P19-N204FD\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N204FE\"><span data-id=\"P19-N204FF\">RESPONDENT: And it\u2019s like\u2026 yeah. Because it\u2019s not serving me real well right now, you know, to have those old notions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20500\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20501\">INTERVIEWER: You know, I don\u2019t learn anything to mastery until I have to teach it to somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20502\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20503\">RESPONDENT: Right. [1:02:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20504\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20505\">INTERVIEWER: Not ever. Not ever. Like I learned DSM-V really, really well not in my doctoral program, but when I began to teach practicum internship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20506\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20507\">RESPONDENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20508\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20509\">INTERVIEWER: Right? I think I was a good counselor in graduate school, but when I really had to teach other people how to be counselors then I had to learn it to mastery. And mastery changes. I mean, you have to change mastery to remain good at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2050A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2050B\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2050C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2050D\">INTERVIEWER: So instead I guess kind of as we end today what I would challenge you to do is find your joy in what you\u2019re doing. Find your joy in it. And enjoy the hell out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2050E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2050F\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20510\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20511\">INTERVIEWER: Right, just really enjoy what you\u2019re learning, enjoy where you are, enjoy the fact that you belong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20512\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20513\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20514\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20515\">INTERVIEWER: You know, enjoy the fact that you developed this great relationship with this very knowledgeable man who sees things in you, and feel free to pick his brain about things, and if he offers you opportunities, I can tell you from firsthand experience, take them. And challenge yourself to continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N205151\">to grow\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20516\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20517\">RESPONDENT: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20518\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20519\">INTERVIEWER: \u2026 about things. And face\u2026 you know, we\u2019re working on killing off the old script. It doesn\u2019t fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2051A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2051B\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2051C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2051D\">INTERVIEWER: And it doesn\u2019t have to hold you back. So find your joy in what you\u2019re doing, and know that you belong here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2051E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2051F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. Yeah. No, and I think I do.
