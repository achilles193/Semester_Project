I want to say, \u2018this is my cousin from my aunt and uncle who are nuts, but that\u2019s like two-thirds of them, at least. So, these are the people who are just like all of the kids and their parents too are the most extroverted, charismatic people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">I\u2019ve ever met. Like very, very talented and very, sort of nuts ways. So Lillian, the one who is getting married, the same age as my sister by like four days and I think both Amanda and I have always been like kind of jealous of them but she\u2019s like it\u2019s not so much that they\u2019ve got their shit together, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200672\">because they really don\u2019t, but they really don\u2019t seem bothered by that at all. And it\u2019s funny watching Amanda and Lillian. Both of them when they walk into a room are instantly the center or focus of the room. It\u2019s just how they work. But I think Amanda sees that in Lillian but does not see that in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200673\">herself. (inaudible) entertaining because there\u2019s a lot of people who usually when they walk into a room are the focus of the room.

So for years, quite recently, he told us, when he got divorced he called Phillip and, or Phillip and she was like you need \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Like, her name\u2019s Phillip?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Her name is Phillip, yeah, which is a family name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. We name both girls and boys Phillip in our family. Which is confusing for some people. Actually, no, we didn\u2019t used to. But my Aunt Phillip was pretty involved in the women\u2019s movement in the 70s and so when her older brother, my uncle, had a second child he named him Phillip after her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">I\u2019m not sure it was as a tribute or making fun of her \u2013 it was probably both. But he called her and she said you need a housekeeper and you need a nanny. Like this is what you need to do. Like here\u2019s how you\u2019re going to deal with your wife leaving you. So, she\u2019s like the greatest person, which I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B2\">\u2013 she always seems, she always thinks she knows what to do. Always takes charge. She had a daughter, Kelly, who died before \u2013 like that was her first child. So before any of us were born.

It was just like nobody talked about her or at least my dad never talked about her. We didn\u2019t see these cousins that often. I found out about it because she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">buried at the same church that my grandparents are buried. It was clearly like so present and so real for Phillip and for (inaudible) and Wyatt and I just hadn\u2019t known about it. And it was clearly real to all the aunts and uncles as well.
