data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: \u2026I\u2019m going to put my faith in them too because I don\u2019t think we can take too much more of this. So how are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m doing okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Okay. And I forgot the movie of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I had a little Post-it Note but it didn\u2019t make it to the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Too bad. No, I feel like it was, good is not a good word, but a couple of watershed moments over the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh do tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I think that the first one was after class. I had a discussion with a friend after class and the conversation revolved around pets and pets\u2019 response to you. And she was saying that we were kind of talking about feelings and having gone through this process of being more in touch and more in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">tune with your feelings, she said it changed the way her animals responded to her. [0:01:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Interesting. How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: They can pick up on the feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yes, they always can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So they now, she seems to feel that they know before she even knows that she\u2019s sad or whatever. So she just noticed that in her animals and I was discussing how it feels like, I was kind of joking that yes, my dog, she just when I first come in she just runs up puts her nose against my leg and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">goes oh it\u2019s him, okay. And then what she said to me was maybe she doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re there. And I know that there\u2019s this whole thing going on that when I\u2019m not there the dog lays around and mopes. And so I\u2019m the alpha dog and when I come home she just needs to know that I\u2019m there and it\u2019s all <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">good. But what I really was hearing and what I took from that was maybe she doesn\u2019t sense that you\u2019re there. Maybe she can\u2019t pick up on those feelings. [0:02:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: And we\u2019re still talking about the dog?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: No. Of course not. So then it was what I sensed after that, it was in that moment, it\u2019s one of those kind of time standing still moments, like that slip on the ice, land on your back and knock the wind out of you. It kind of took my breath away and I said oh my God, what if I\u2019m really not there? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">Just in terms of of course I\u2019m not there. If I can\u2019t be with my feelings, you\u2019ve shut off this huge part of you. And what if the dog really doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re there? Those kind of feelings but certainly I\u2019m not as much there as I could be. You know, it\u2019s just that real, that reality, that sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">of like \u2013 yes, it was just that insight, big insight. [0:03:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: And what did you take that to mean for your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: That being in touch with feelings and embracing that. I guess where I went with that then just kind of making that commitment to sit with whatever the feeling was that was coming at the time. And I recognized that it didn\u2019t take long before I was like holy crap, I\u2019m in this place of all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">feelings. [0:04:04].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What feelings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Anger, fear, confusion, those \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">[Phone rings]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Oh I\u2019m sorry. I keep forgetting to turn that off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay. All those things that kind of things that are coming at me and I just kind of sat with that on Friday. And then got up early on Saturday, too early, went to the Y to work out and then didn\u2019t come home until 7:00. So I had a half hour to park near the Y with a three-mile track around <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">it out in the woods. It\u2019s a nice area and I was doing this power walk around there and I was energized by that. I was mentally in my mind. At some point I said yes, you know what I\u2019m drawing a line in the sand. I\u2019m not \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561982\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the line?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: going to \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 I think that when I recognized or identified that it\u2019s a commitment to authenticity. No, I got to be with whatever it is. I\u2019ve got to let go of the old habits and patterns of how to deal with feelings and \u2013 it\u2019s like that old metaphor of sitting with the snake. [0:05:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yes, right. I mean it sounds like a pretty powerful moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: It was, yes. And it was again another one of those kind of like \u2013 it\u2019s still close enough event to me to have that sense of feeling, of being in the park. I remember the conversation; I remember the park. It\u2019s like snapshot moments. So there\u2019s the commitment to that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: What will change for you then? What will be different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Well then coming back home from the Y, I was energized and recognizing that the closer and closer I got to home wow all of this anger is kind of building up. And I said okay, I\u2019m just going to be with this. And coming into the house and I said okay. [0:06:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">And so it didn\u2019t take long before what\u2019s wrong? And I recognized that there was a big part of me that said nothing. I didn\u2019t go there but I know those patterns, I know what to do, I know what to say to be inauthentic. And so eventually I got to be able to this place of just sitting with it and calmly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">sitting with it enough that I\u2019m like yes, it\u2019s part of the stuff that I\u2019m working through. I\u2019m \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Tell me what you were sitting with. What were you feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Oh, it\u2019s difficult to \u2013 just the image of my mind is the big soup pot on the stove. And you can tell it\u2019s boiling, you know the lids on it kind of thing and just lifting it up enough to know that there\u2019s \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Steam coming up. [0:07:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes. So the anger and wow this is not just, there\u2019s not a particular incident, it\u2019s all of the stuff. It\u2019s all of this anger. And I recognize that I\u2019m not going to run away from it but I\u2019m also not sure I can open the lid on this right now. So it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me what you think is in the pot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Oh years of built up anger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Tell me about it. Let\u2019s name it. [0:08:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Angry at being, the feeling of being stuck in this relationship; anger of betrayal, feeling like you\u2019ve been betrayed. So there\u2019s that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes, whatever. Anger probably going all the way back to being a kid. Anger about not being able to just be angry or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: What else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Seamus, how would I know you\u2019re angry? What would it look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes, I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019m there yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Where would you have to be for me to know you\u2019re angry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: [Pause] I don\u2019t know. But I do know that it\u2019s kind of like that same sense of being angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: So even in the process of discussing anger it becomes intellectualized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes and no. I spent the weekend in tears, not a lot but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yes, tell me about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: on the verge of tears and I\u2019m just again trying not to intellectualize that too much but just okay, I\u2019m just going to sit with this, whatever this is. [0:09:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561982\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And what was it? What brought you to tears?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Maybe tapping into loneliness, tapping into, or you know, yes sadness. Again, anger and sadness about \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Any grief there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yes, maybe. Maybe. Yes, there\u2019s maybe that too. Knowing that I didn\u2019t really spend a lot of time trying to name stuff as much as just trying to sit with it, yes. So \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve been busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Well yes. So knowing that that, yes, is a lot of what was going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: So what does it feel like to talk about this? What do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Oh I\u2019m feeling energized, committed, whatever. I\u2019m okay with that. Knowing that yes, I\u2019m not exactly sure what it looks like necessarily to be angry can I feel that? It\u2019s getting closer. I have a \u2013 I will back up just a second because I, in coming back I was able to not only did I not go down <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">the path of denying what I was feeling, but I was able to make some inroads in terms of saying what I was feeling. [0:11:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty fantastic. To yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: No, to Mary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m doing some -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Whoa. Let\u2019s go back. What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Well I was really I was committed to staying with that. Even though it was a little bit frightening I said, okay I just need to just be with this. Not in any kind of accusatory place but okay, well I know from the program, from this work of whatever, self-discovery that I\u2019m doing that I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">that it\u2019s really important for me to just be with my feelings right now. All I can tell you is that I\u2019m just feeling a lot of anger right now and this is where I can be with that. [0:12:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: This is what you said to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: And then it was kind of that sense of I don\u2019t really remember the question but it was a probing question and in terms of it was a question that was going to, it required me to, like a self-revelation kind of thing. It was a deeper [0:13:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: She asked you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes and I recognized at the moment I can\u2019t go there. So what I was able to say to her was I said well one of the things that I\u2019ve learned through the program is that in order for that kind of communication to happen there has to be an alliance, there has to be this trust relationship there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">And she was able to get it. She said so you\u2019re not feeling like you can trust me? And I said yes, I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And that was received how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: I think it was, my guess just in terms of being together for 27 years, it was that moment of panic and fear probably, probably maybe a sense of wanting to close down from that a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yes. I\u2019m just guessing. And I was also, we were also, it wasn\u2019t like a conversation too much but it was recognizing I think she did say something about recognizing that the state of our relationship being what it is. You know it\u2019s like we talk about it without talking about it, that kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">thing. We never really talk about it but there\u2019s a recognition that it\u2019s not what it\u2019s supposed to be.

And I was just able to say yes, you know it\u2019s a huge knotted ball of twine and it didn\u2019t get this way overnight. And it\u2019s going to take a lot to try to untangle this and I\u2019m just not sure where that\u2019s going to go. And then able to kind of and then there was this sense, I wish that I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">a tape recorder in my head to kind of be able to kind of replay that and look at it, but there was more of a sense of like the way that I felt it was, well I\u2019m, from her, well I\u2019m hopeful that this process or this program will help you and I get closer together.

And I felt this instantaneous sort of being angry about that because what it felt to me was I\u2019m sure that once you get fixed everything will be fine. And so I was able to just say well this is my journey and this is my path and we all have a path that we need to walk. And it was about as <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">far as I could go with that. And, so that was it felt empowering to be in that place and it was not tremendously scary, but I was in this place of I had a real burn on coming back from the Y and I said I\u2019m okay. The line\u2019s in the sand; I\u2019m not crossing back. [0:16:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty incredible.

When you started you sort of, it\u2019s a sort of self-process. You should be pretty incredibly proud of yourself. That took a lot of guts to even bring it up. It\u2019s interesting your interpretation <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">of her response. Your immediate sort of emotion was anger and your sort of interpretation of her response was sort of like you need to get fixed and we\u2019ll be okay. From an outsider\u2019s point of view I would not have, that\u2019s not what I initially would\u2019ve thought. Now you have obviously much more data than <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD2\">I do. [0:17:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Well yes, and it\u2019s data. It\u2019s past experiences; it\u2019s too many. It\u2019s too many of those scenarios in the past where everything will be just fine once you figure out how to open up and share your feelings and you do this and you do this. Again, that\u2019s my interpretation of how I\u2019m interpreting that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">communication and there\u2019s always two sides to the story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: But while she acknowledged the problem, not, no, she acknowledged a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: A problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yes, that there is a problem. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes.

That\u2019s a pretty intimate thing to do, to sort of not only allow yourself to be in the moment emotionally which can be very scary, but also to take it and it sort of provoked you to action. You did something with it. You had a conversation about it in a very honest <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">way. That\u2019s significant, Seamus. [0:18:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yes, and I really do feel like there has been some click in terms of it\u2019s just like the it\u2019s almost like that sense of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. Once you know that the little old guy is behind the curtains, you can go back. It\u2019s like okay, this is it; you\u2019ve got to be authentic. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">not an academic exercise.

And some of it\u2019s by tacit agreement. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a huge part of you that\u2019s happy to drive back on your own, and then on the other hand it\u2019s kind of like now we just started something here and you deliberately didn\u2019t see the opportunity or ran from <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201111\">the opportunity and I guess I\u2019d be feeling mixed feelings. One, I\u2019m relieved, I don\u2019t have to do this with you, or two, you just validated everything I ever thought about you. Or three, and then it would also hurt.

And this work has been years in coming to kind of allow yourself to be in an emotional place, really get in touch with all of the pain and sort of discomfort those feelings bring, and to say something about it. And then, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D1\">again it\u2019s received but it\u2019s not furthered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: No and again I\u2019m trying not to be in this place of setting up the rules of the game and then not telling anybody. It\u2019s like well, I didn\u2019t put it out there; I\u2019d like to continue this conversation. I just put that out there. So [0:26:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: But we always have hopes don\u2019t we? We always kind of hope or wish I remember, for example my husband and I got into some kind of argument or whatever and we were really getting on each other\u2019s nerves so I went upstairs. And I thought to myself now part of me wants to be alone from you while <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201211\">you have your grumpy self downstairs and I\u2019m upstairs. And I thought but it\u2019s probably better for the relationship if you either come up here or I go down there. And he came up and said do you want to watch a movie, which is his repair effort, and I said okay, I\u2019ll be down in a minute, and I went downstairs. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201212\">So that means he was the mature one in that situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">But I thought, I remember thinking about it and I think what happened there was a miss. You had a connection, which you haven\u2019t had in a while where there was a conversation, some potential for some intimacy, even kind of just starting, and then the hope was that she would do something with that, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201231\">I made an effort here; not only I hope you recognize how hard this is for me but then you also make an effort. I\u2019m not talking huge expectations here. And then unfortunately your hope, your wish did not come true, which sometimes makes you go okay, I was right.

I mean that tells me you have felt slapped down any time you\u2019ve been vulnerable and you say absolutely not. Even the way you talk about your feelings with her in this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B1\">instance over the weekend is informative but it\u2019s not inviting her to not only comfort you because you don\u2019t trust that she will or can do that, it\u2019s not inviting her to even participate, it\u2019s informing her which is a power position. It\u2019s like I\u2019m going to tell you how I feel but I\u2019m not going to invite <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B2\">you to experience it with me. And that tells me there\u2019s such a long history of your feeling shut down, misunderstood and deeply hurt that you do not trust that she can handle your basic feelings at all.

We\u2019re getting ready <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201451\">to go out and she says well Lisa\u2019s husband\u2019s gone for the weekend; I invited her to come along too. And I\u2019m like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: Oh Steve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: [Laughing] son of a bitch. It\u2019s just and I said sure, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s not okay with you.

And I do get that. That part of you is sort of relieved, and part of you also pissed and part of you is just kind of accepting it.

How did that feel to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: Oh, you know it\u2019s just the reality of what it is right now. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that way forever but I recognize that that\u2019s my condition. I\u2019m stuck right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: You feel stuck. You\u2019re not stuck.

I\u2019m yes, you know what? I need to figure out whatever strategies I need to do to get myself unstuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">THERAPIST: Because you don\u2019t want this anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want this anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">CLIENT: So I don\u2019t know where that goes. And for me all options are on the table. I don\u2019t all I know is I\u2019m done with the old shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">THERAPIST: And the old shit that you\u2019re done with is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">CLIENT: Just going back into that place of I\u2019m going to deny my feelings and I\u2019m going to say that this is okay and go into this place of stasis or something. I said no. [0:33:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re done with that. I see that, which means you\u2019re not silenced any more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: No I don\u2019t really think so. I recognize that it\u2019s emerging; it\u2019s new. I\u2019m not necessarily afraid of it but I also recognize that there\u2019s a certain wisdom that I\u2019m wanting to bring with it. It\u2019s like, okay, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s sort of like the dog that\u2019s been chained to the barn all of its life and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201711\">somebody lets it go, there\u2019s this inclination for it to just run like hell. [0:34:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: And what would that look like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: I mean there\u2019s an initial euphoria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yes, what\u2019s the fantasy? If you could have no restrictions what would you do now? No restrictions, no guilt restrictions, no commitment restrictions what would you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: You know I recognize, really as much as I sit in this little cell of enjoying putting on the clothing of not good enough and low self-esteem, it\u2019s like shit, I\u2019m a pretty good guy and there\u2019s a hell of a lot of people out there that I know I can connect with. Yes, can I allow myself just to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201791\">say that? Can I allow myself to run free off the chain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yes, at least in the fantasy. [0:35:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yes, I\u2019d find a relationship where I could explore. And I\u2019m not talking [sexualizing it] (ph); I\u2019m talking about I just want to be known by somebody. I want to know somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: But what if sexual intimacy was part of that? That doesn\u2019t have to be, I mean that\u2019s a normal part of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Yes, and I would be okay with that. But I think for me right now that, that need -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: The need to be known.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: is even deeper than the sexual piece. I recognize that the sexual piece is there and that I don\u2019t want to deny that either but I\u2019m just saying I need some water first [laughs] and then we can deal with other things. So, yes, that\u2019s the fantasy piece. Can I imagine that fantasy piece in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201851\">relationship that I currently have? Not right now. Does that mean that it could never happen again? I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m open to that possibility maybe. I mean if I have to put a percentage on there maybe I\u2019m 10% open to that right now. I mean there would have to be some serious work in terms of trust <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201852\">being built back up again. I at this point don\u2019t see the possibility of that happening but maybe it does.

You\u2019ve really had to get down there and sort of get into the guts of the thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">CLIENT: Well maybe that\u2019s where you get after you wallow in it for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Well, wallow. I hope there\u2019s no self-judgment there. You feel kind of what you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">CLIENT: No I don\u2019t necessarily, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a I\u2019m not yes, that wasn\u2019t necessarily meant to be a knocking myself kind of a thing but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">THERAPIST: So embracing your feelings is empowering. [0:37:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">CLIENT: Yes, I think so. A little frightening but empowering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yes because feelings are probably the most real part of us. They\u2019re the most honest as long as you don\u2019t judge them or try to rationalize them out they just are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">CLIENT: And I think that, I think over the weekend I was hugely grateful or leaning on my meditation practice because it allowed me to stay in the moment and okay this is the skill that I didn\u2019t have before. I didn\u2019t know how to do that before. I just ran like hell or I put the lid on it or whatever. [0:38:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">THERAPIST: Well and you know why you ran like hell?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, because I didn\u2019t want to be hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Well not just that. I mean you were already hurt but the experiencing it and looking at it you were always told whether through words or actions something is wrong with you if you feel this way or you shouldn\u2019t feel this way or feelings aren\u2019t important or don\u2019t show us your feelings. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B1\">that message got repeated from childhood through adulthood. And you realized, we were talking about scripts that aren\u2019t true, it\u2019s not true. Your feelings are and we talked a lot several weeks ago about you being a deeply feeling man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yes, and I think that it helped be able to get in touch with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a gift, Seamus.

I think I\u2019m starting to appreciate that and recognizing it\u2019s who do I connect with. Other people that have deep feelings. I haven\u2019t found too many guys that have deep feelings that I can connect with. The only one that I did three years ago told <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A11\">me he\u2019s trans. I said oh shit, crap, cross that one off the list. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Well there are if you look at remember when we talked about Jung (ph) and his work?

It\u2019s just that they\u2019re not in my immediate circle of people. And I think that once I put the intention out there that I throw that out into the universe, they\u2019ll start showing.

These guys are up in Shorewood and I\u2019m down here in Limestone. We get together every six months. So it\u2019s more like, I see it more like a quasi-supervision group almost. We get together and we kind of check in. It\u2019s a place to kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A91\">of connect for an hour or two and then -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561982\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Okay.

And I think Peterson\u2019s also talked about the fact that I might be able to, there might be some connection there. We\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see what happens. See if there is a connection. I might end up working or doing something in that field too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Well that would be great. That\u2019s a lot of work in a very short amount of time. I mean you\u2019ve been really working very hard.

If I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Well you could be. You\u2019d just be one type of counselor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yes, well it\u2019s not the kind of counselor I want to be. Okay, I get it.

Whenever I choose to take on a project, I\u2019m going to figure out what needs to be done and I\u2019m going to surround myself with a network of people to help me <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B91\">figure out how to get this thing done. And we\u2019re going to do it and it\u2019s going to get done well. And there\u2019s a certain perseverance involved. Yes.

There was a whole lot of well that was a really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Did you participate in building your house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">CLIENT: I built my house.

I\u2019m an Industrial Arts teacher so I told myself that I knew how to build a house.

You built your house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C9\">CLIENT: I put together a team of people and I learned everything I needed to know and I built the damn house.

Like you just decided to build a damn house. So why -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">CLIENT: Well it was building a house but it was also building a cottage industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Okay, but you never built a house before, right? So whatever you put your mind to you seem to be very successful at it, right? And if you can build a house from scratch, what can you do with yourself? I mean there are countless of examples that counter the negative scripts and we just continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF1\">to discover. You built a freaking house. Well that\u2019s pretty significant. [0:46:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">CLIENT: No and I think that you asked how does this impact, how is this getting in touch with your feelings and I think that what kind of it does somehow. It\u2019s like pulling back the veil; I get that. Yes, there\u2019s a lot of shit there to celebrate; there\u2019s a lot of good stuff there and I can go with that. [0:47:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like rebuilding your house from the inside. I mean it\u2019s sort of like really looking at what\u2019s inside, what the patterns are, what it feels like, what it looks like, embracing, accepting what\u2019s on the inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">CLIENT: Yes, and again I\u2019m kind of employing some of those same patterns that I did before. I need help doing this; I\u2019ve got to surround myself with people who know how to do this. I\u2019m not sure I could\u2019ve built the house all by myself but having a network of people that can aid me in doing that kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202051\">of thing. Not, yes I could do it by myself. I\u2019m sure eventually I could figure this thing out but I like the energy of working with a team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">THERAPIST: Well and you don\u2019t have to build anything by yourself. You can but you certainly don\u2019t have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">CLIENT: So, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty incredible. [0:48:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">CLIENT: And also just like had this thought of wow, that there\u2019s a lot of anger just sitting there for another time. Like, when we moved from that house over to Bradley-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020F\">THERAPIST: From the house you built to Bradley?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20211\">CLIENT: so that the kids could be in the other school district and so my wife could be closer to her best friend. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20213\">THERAPIST: You always laugh. You know what? I\u2019ve come to learn that that\u2019s where the anger is. Whenever you laugh like that, usually there\u2019s some hurt or some anger there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20215\">CLIENT: Yes, I know. Thanks, but, yes that\u2019s yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20217\">THERAPIST: So tell me, so you built the house and you moved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20219\">CLIENT: Well I built the house, then I built the house, I was working as a teacher, then I was kind of moving toward setting up cottage industry. So I got my furniture building business in the garage so I\u2019m there when the kids I can get the kids off to school in the morning, I\u2019m there when they <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202191\">come home so it was just like this whole little dream that I had created. And then it was we made the decision that my daughter it wasn\u2019t working out in the school district or the school system where she was at so it was try to figure out how to plug her into the other one, which precipitated buying <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202192\">a house. And then eventually it was like oh now it\u2019s a 25 minute drive from the house to the school and then this is getting crazy and [0:49:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20218-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20218-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561982\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B\">THERAPIST: How did you feel about those decisions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">CLIENT: Oh my God. It was I was in the pit for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F\">THERAPIST: Meaning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20221\">CLIENT: Depressed, angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20223\">THERAPIST: So this was not a decision you wanted to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20225\">CLIENT: It was a decision that, yes it seemed like the best thing to do for my daughter but it was, yes I was letting go of my house and my dream and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20227\">THERAPIST: And there was no discussion of your letting go of the house and the dream?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20229\">CLIENT: Well I would have to really dig up those memories again because I\u2019ve sat on all I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B\">THERAPIST: But you haven\u2019t sat on the feelings because that\u2019s so after you build the house, the family moves into the house and then the family moves back out of the house. That\u2019s a rejection of the house, of what you built.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022D\">CLIENT: And it was probably a little bit more personal than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Yes, so tell me about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20231\">CLIENT: You know I think at the point when we did make the move over, that this, the friendship had started to build. So that there was this sense of, for me even though it wasn\u2019t spoken, there was this sense of this is just damned inconvenient. There\u2019s a half an hour drive that\u2019s going to have to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202311\">place if you\u2019re going to go from one person\u2019s house to the other house. And that\u2019s like so I knew that I felt, I didn\u2019t know, I felt that there was another motivation for moving out of the house along with getting the kids over into the school district. [0:51:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">And then when the kids were out of the school district and we no longer needed to be over there, then moving back out to the house there was almost that sense of resistance in terms of like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">THERAPIST: Which is a rejection of the house that you built for your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">CLIENT: Which I take a little bit more personally. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">THERAPIST: Well yes because it\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s pretty symbolic of everything, as is your going along with the decisions but not really feeling included in making kind of being forced feeling like you\u2019re forced into making these decisions and you never got to vent your feelings about them. [0:52:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">CLIENT: I never allowed myself or if I you know what, I think that I did but there was that there was always this cold sense of logic like well this is the best decision kind of, what other choice, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">THERAPIST: But then you have to buy a house that somebody else built to live in when you built your house for your family\u2019s needs. That\u2019s pretty deep, which is why every time you go home you feel a sense of anger because the symbols are everywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">CLIENT: Well and my business remained at my house so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20241\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right, so you had to go back to the house -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20243\">CLIENT: so I had to drive back to an empty house every day and, yes.
