I feel like I\u2019ve been doing some more socializing recently and (inaudible at 00:01:28) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">good but man, it makes me just not during it actually but afterwards, I can\u2019t stop picking apart things that I said and things that I said wrong and reasons for them to hate me and all that. So it feels sort of paradoxical that I had a nice evening out with some friends, it is something that makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">me feel sort of bruised and anxious and I don\u2019t know. (pause) May be particularly vulnerable but I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the way I am. So it is. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">It\u2019s funny, I sort of was worried about my drinking and about that I was drinking a lot more. James and I just haven\u2019t really bought any beer in the last month, like, just haven\u2019t done it. And I just don\u2019t really notice. So, that makes me happy.

(pause) I had some nice beer last night though so [I\u2019m doing good] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: (overlapping talking) That\u2019s probably good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was good.

Yeah, like, we\u2019re driving into therapy and the traffic <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">is frustrating so he sort of is snippy with me and it is like, the most predictable occurrence in the world. It\u2019s not really okay but I also told him that it\u2019s not really okay and it keeps happening and I don\u2019t It\u2019s something that I am sort of willing to put up with (inaudible at 00:05:00) I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">like this but it\u2019s not that big of a deal and I know what\u2019s going on and we sort of talked about that and went (ph) like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine.\u201d And you know it just gets under my skin. Actually that pretty much just gets under my skin every time. I try for it not to and I try different ways of handling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">it but it just keeps getting under my skin. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\"> But on the way I back I mentioned I haven\u2019t forgotten wanting to get a tent.

And his immediate and only response was \u201cYeah, we really can\u2019t afford that right now.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI really know that we can\u2019t afford it, I really know!\u201d I just feel like I\u2019m trying to tell you that I\u2019m lonely and I want companionship and I feel like I\u2019m being rebuked for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">wanting things at all. And that\u2019s not really a reasonable response on my part. It\u2019s sort of a jump, I feel like, to ask him to see this code in what I said. (laughs) On the other hand, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a jump for me to want his knee-jerk response to me saying that I want something to be like, \u201cWe <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">can\u2019t afford that.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562240\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Especially when he knows [that could or should know that he\u2019d know that] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yes.

And that\u2019s fine but I, (pause) I guess what I wondered is whether you were concerned that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">(pause) [I imagined] (ph) two things but I didn\u2019t feel (inaudible at 0:08:19) it would just make you feel worse to explain it, like, it would make you feel worse about how much it bothered you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s probably it. That it\u2019s, (pause) it\u2019s sort of easier to refer in broad strokes to this dynamic that I feel like I\u2019ve talked about before and it\u2019s also so naked (ph) (laughs) I feel like I\u2019m under the impression that I\u2019ve talked about it to you before but maybe not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: (laughs) I don\u2019t know, I guess not, knowing what had happened as (laughs) (inaudible at 0:08:59).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Oh!

I said, \u201cThis is your turn.\u201d And he said, \u201cIs it? I don\u2019t think Is that what the sign says? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my turn.\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I was like, \u201cNo, I guess that\u2019s not what the sign says.\u201d But it was actually the turn before (ph) a different road on both sides of the street. So we missed it and he had to make a U-turn. And so he was frustrated and I could sort of feel him wanting to make it my fault but it was clearly (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">I was the one who said \u201cThis is your turn\u201d because I remembered it. So there was that and then he didn\u2019t actually try to make it my fault but you could sort of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You could feel it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I could feel it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: And then when we parked, we were looking for parking, and we ended up in one of the spots that was that had to have quarters instead of taking in a credit card and we didn\u2019t have quarters and then we had to move and (pause) and he was just grumpy with me about it. I don\u2019t remember what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">he said, I just remember him being grumpy with me. You know, I just (pause) He and I have sort of talked about this several times and he sort of made it clear when we talk about it that he\u2019s not upset with me, he\u2019s just pissed about the driving and that spills over and I sort of find it unacceptable <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">that it spills over. But I recognize that that\u2019s just something that people\u2019s emotions do sometimes and I don\u2019t know how much is reasonable to ask him to not indicate that he\u2019s frustrated in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Because I also have a problem where if he expresses frustration, I take it as being about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562240\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Even if he\u2019s not actually making it about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

If we think about it as like, James getting under your skin or it\u2019s If I have super ex ray vision than it\u2019s not like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">kind of out there already in what you\u2019re saying or that you\u2019re You know, in a way, unconsciously maybe even wanting me to know or trying to communicate it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, no.

So to say like, \u201cYeah, sometimes things are just out there\u201d is to say <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">like, \u201cI\u2019ve really failed in some way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I see.

(pause) You know, I can\u2019t sort of figure why I would think that people knowing that I cut myself is why I would think of that as a shameful thing but really, like, that it bothers me when James is sniffy with me, that that is something that I\u2019m ashamed of? I don\u2019t know. You know, afraid <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">and also ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: [I think that] (ph) it seems less obvious that you would the same, like it\u2019s easier to (inaudible at 00:29:02).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.
