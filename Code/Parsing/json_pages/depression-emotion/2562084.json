Today is going a little better. I got sick again. (therapist responds) It\u2019s just like, a cold or like (therapist affirms)... I\u2019m just tired of being sick. I don\u2019t know. So... I\u2019ve been whining about it a lot. (pause) Yeah, James and I talked a lot this weekend, most of which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">was good. You know, sort of like... hard to get back in the way of talking well, not so much in terms of agreeing, but in terms of like... having the conversation be productive, or feeling like we\u2019re both being heard, and feeling like we\u2019re both getting to talk (therapist affirms), and feeling like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">things are going in a way that is, I guess... I don\u2019t know. I... I have a very clear idea of what I want to say, but not so much with being able to articulate it. (pause) Yeah. James spent a fair amount of time yesterday and the day before reading about a religious group that he grew up in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s it called?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Religion Together. (therapist responds) He was like, \u201cYup. Definitely a cult.\u201d He was sort of like... He sort of has been like, telling people that he was raised in a cult, I think as sort of like, both sort of a \u201cF*** you!\u201d to that religious organization, because he\u2019s pretty angry at them, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">but also... (sighs) definitely (ph) not sort of seriously believing that that\u2019s what it was. (therapist affirms) But he sort of read up on them, and read up about, on like, the practices of cults, how they are defined, and what do they do, and they work. He was like, \u201cOh, yeah! Yeah, that was my childhood.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">So that\u2019s led to some interesting conversations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Yeah. (pause) You know, we talked some about... I think for him it was helpful to... to realize that like, oh, well in a lot of ways, your experience in scholarsh , in the world of scholarship was like, remarkably similar and in many ways like... so... I think that was sort of helpful for him to see <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">that parallel. It was nice for me, for him to see that parallel as something I already sort of pondered, and I\u2019m like, \u201cYup, that makes sense.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: How do you mean, like the cult-ishness of academia?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Or at least... you know, definitely biblical scholarship, but I feel like the humanities more generally. I don\u2019t know enough about the sciences. You know, I think it\u2019s different in different places, but... (therapist affirms) But like, the pyramidal power structure, where you sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">of are promised that you\u2019ll be able to move up, but you\u2019re not actually going to be able to move up, and the sort of... \u201cyou\u2019re in or you\u2019re out,\u201d \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality of like, if you leave, it\u2019s not just that you\u2019re leaving, it\u2019s like, your whole identity is gone, and that you\u2019re seen as betraying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">your community by leaving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: So... (pause) You know, I\u2019m not sure the parallel is as strong as... he\u2019s sort of making it right now. But, I think it\u2019s really there. (therapist affirms) (pause) Yeah, so there is a lot of me... being like, \u201cWell, this is a time for us to have these conversations, and I really want to be having <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">these conversations and so like, I am just going to pull it together in order to have them.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562084\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">And... (pause) about which I have mixed feelings. (chuckles) (therapist affirms) Like... you know, I think... honestly, like... I think James would have been hurt if I had said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t feel like, I feel I\u2019m too sad to talk about these things. Like, I can\u2019t connect with you today. I just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">I\u2019m too sad.\u201d You know, I think it would have been really hard, hurtful for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: And so I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: But it also sort of felt like... in some ways like... I was doing the thing that was not the best for me in order to take care of us (therapist affirms), to take care of him. I don\u2019t really feel that good about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">(pause) But on the other hand, I\u2019m a lot less sort of exhausted and being down today than I was expecting, so... (pause) Yup. I made bread. And... which is something that I like, I like to do, because I really like homemade bread, but I have to sort of trick myself into it, because I always think of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">it as this like, big enterprise that\u2019s going to be hard. (whispers) It\u2019s really not hard; it takes like, ten minutes, if that. But, so like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">There are a lot of days where I\u2019m like, \u201cI should make some bread. Like, I should cook something,\u201d and then I just don\u2019t do it. Like, I just don\u2019t... have the energy. (pause) yeah. Cooking this weekend has been like pulling teeth. I have... (chuckles) Like, yesterday... we got up and it like, quickly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">became apparent that like, we were going to have to cook breakfast like, that was, because we just didn\u2019t feel like we didn\u2019t have anything that we could just snack on. And I was like, \u201cOkay. I have to do this, like I just have to do it.\u201d Like, I could have asked James to, but I didn\u2019t want to, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">so I made pancakes. Took about an hour. (chuckles) Mostly because it took a long time with me like... It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay! (chuckles) Let\u2019s do this!\u201d So, I don\u2019t know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I guess some of the other things that you\u2019ve been saying about, I\u2019m wondering if... like in that case, it wasn\u2019t between you and James or between you and part of you. Like, \u201cI really don\u2019t feel like making pancakes (chuckles) right now.\u201d (client affirms) Like, not feeling that\u2019s where you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">at, to do something to take care of yourself. (client affirms) And constructive. (client affirms) And... (pause) kind of forcing yourself to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like it\u2019s hard to predict, for me... You know like, one of the sort of standard things that people tell you is like, \u201cDo the things that make you feel better or are good for you.\u201d Like, practice self-care, even when you don\u2019t feel like it, you know. Like, go for a walk, and eat <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">good food, and get enough sleep, and like, take care of yourself in those ways. But you know like, sometimes doing that is actually helpful, and sometimes it really backfires, because I just feel like I\u2019m... becoming my own tyrant. (therapist affirms) So... I\u2019m sort of right on the edge (ph) today. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">(chuckles) (therapist affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">(pause 00:09:28 to 00:10:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Similarly like, going to church last night, and going to dinner with some friends afterward, it\u2019s like... really just sort of right on the edge between like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s nice to see friends and like, have social interaction.\u201d Like, that\u2019s a good thing for me. And then like, (whispers) I\u2019m really tired <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">and I don\u2019t want to do this. (therapist affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562084\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">(pause 00:10:26 to 00:10:48)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">Yeah, I feel pretty low. (therapist affirms) I\u2019m sleeping a lot in bed. I\u2019m just like... still tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and it\u2019s part of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: ... just feel sad. (therapist responds) Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well... it seems to be something that\u2019s, it sounds like what you\u2019re describing is that... like, some of the stakes or the intensities actually feel... in a way like, higher than from what you\u2019re saying would suggest. You know like... just about (ph) anybody can say, \u201cWell, I was sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">of torn between seeing people and going out and doing stuff last night and not. You know, and just taking it easy.\u201d But I guess, the fairly pedestrian sort of conflict in a way, but I think... you know, you\u2019re not like a tyrant, tyranny. And... in some way, it seems the stakes are actually quite a bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">higher (client affirms), that it\u2019s not so much like, \u201cOh, would you be happier if you do this or do that, or you know if you like, push yourself a little to do this.\u201d It\u2019s more like... (pause) \u201cHey, there would be pretty like, crushing and self-abnegating to... push yourself to do something or like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B3\">potentially... disastrous... to... let yourself be.\u201d I mean like, what you sort of started out talking about, the conversation with James. (client affirms) I guess there it was obvious, in a way, that the stakes were very high. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean... right now at least like, sort of like... whenever like, James or I reach out to one another like, those are very high stakes. (therapist affirms) I can\u2019t just say like, you know, \u201cNot today.\u201d (chuckles) I then like, when it\u2019s like... yeah... (pause) you know (sighs), I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">sort of slowly and painfully coming to realize that like, when I don\u2019t eat like, that\u2019s really bad for my mood and like (therapist affirms), potentially like, disastrously bad for my mood. (therapist affirms) Yeah, I felt sort of very... (pause) I guess like... pretty vulnerable with those choices (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">affirms) that like... either one could work out really badly for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right. (pause) This reminds me a little bit of what we were talking about, too, on Friday, about your feeling... I guess both suicidal and also like you want to cut yourself. I imagine... you might feel a similar dilemma kind of getting into that sense (ph) we were talking about, edge (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I thought about dying a lot this weekend. (therapist affirms) At the same time, so it\u2019s sort of like, others have it like, when there is like... I felt like in some situations, I would sort of make the decision to like, do the thing that was hard, that took care of myself. In some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">situations, I would make the decision to like, just let it go and rest. And it just sort of was bad either way. Like, I\u2019m not sure that there was a right decision there. (chuckles) I\u2019m not sure there was actually a lot riding on the decisions (therapist affirms), so much as like, things suck. (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">So... I\u2019m not sure whether that makes me feel better or worse. (pause) I think better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, actually... trying to think of it, um... I bet... like... I\u2019m (ph) really going to turn things on their head a little bit like... Oftentimes, you feel really sort of stressed and desperate are times where you\u2019re in just that sort of dilemma, where it\u2019s impossible, because neither <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">choice seems tenable. (client affirms) And you\u2019re totally stuck. But I bet most of the time, it\u2019s like what you say. Neither option is all that good. I mean, more accurately, they\u2019re both pretty, they are awful things about both. (client affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562084\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">(pause) And maybe that idea that you, you know, it\u2019s really important to pick the right one is mostly about having the idea that you can get out of how awful either one is (client affirms), which I think can be really hard to swallow, less so now, clearly. (client affirms) I mean like, with James, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">example... that things are shaky enough, that if it\u2019s possible you really connect, you really have to... do what you can to like, take that opportunity. I guess the really tough thing there is... how shaky things are (client affirms)... and how hard it\u2019s been to connect in the ways that matter. (client <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">affirms) Or on the other side... how awful you\u2019re feeling and... yeah, I mean, just how... difficult and dangerous it is to... have that in a relationship. (client affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">(pause 00:18:29 to 00:19:03)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess the... here is something like talking with James. I mean, I think there is definitely like, a right choice there. (therapist affirms) Something like, \u201cHow do I take care of myself like...\u201d Maybe there is a right choice, but there are not really a choice that makes me feel better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">like, those are... or that will necessarily make me feel better like... (therapist affirms) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, that makes sense, but like, just because it\u2019s a tough choice doesn\u2019t mean one is not actually better than the other. (client affirms) You\u2019ve been pretty clearly towards you... did do the right thing, as far as talking to James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">(pause 00:19:50 to 00:21:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">So on the way to couples\u2019 counselling this morning (or on the way back, actually), we passed a bakery that had some little like, cutesy advertisement in the window. It was like an apron or something that had on it like, \u201cThe voices say to have cupcakes for breakfast,\u201d or something. James (ph) was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">\u201cThat is in spectacularly bad taste!\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, gosh! Wow!\u201d (whispers) Because he knew. Psychosis is fun for everybody! Um... So I sort of... pointed it out to James and that got us into a conversation of like, what exactly like, a psychotic episode is like, what is it. So I was like, \u201cThis is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">how I understand it,\u201d and we talked about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">(pause) He was like, \u201cDo you have psychotic episodes? I was like, \u201cAs far as I know, no. Like, nobody seems to say that that\u2019s something that happens for me.\u201d (therapist affirms) (pause) I\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m thinking about that. (pause) I think it\u2019s just like... it\u2019s just difficult to explain <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">what things are like for me to James. And I\u2019m sort of moving away from trying to... get him to understand it exactly in the way that I understand it (therapist affirms), because I don\u2019t find that A) that actually (inaudible) happened and B) that that\u2019s super helpful. I think, \u201cMaybe James just doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">need to know how much I (chuckles) think about killing myself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562084\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">(pause 00:22:59 to 00:23:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">I did talk to him about... saying well, you know, what does happen for me is that like, when I feel suicidal, I get (sighs)... like, my reasoning gets just messed up and I can\u2019t see any of the things that are good. All I see is the things that say that I should kill myself, and that\u2019s all I can really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">be aware of. So the key for me is to like, remember that I can\u2019t remember these things, but... I\u2019m like... that\u2019s hard. (therapist affirms) And it doesn\u2019t feel as real as... the situation is just really bad. (pause) You know like, I think he got that, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">(pause 00:24:10 to 00:24:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">It\u2019s sort of a lonely, scary place.

(pause) And I\u2019m just like really grumpy about it. (chuckles) Like, aside from being, you know, very low, and suicidal, and wanting to self-injure, and all of that stuff. I\u2019m just like, (inaudible) sick! (therapist affirms) Son of a b****! (chuckles) So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">(pause 00:25:30 to 00:25:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: I mean, it\u2019s like... when you\u2019re feeling... suicidal, the rest of the world... like, everybody else feels, in a way, like a part of a... totalitarian regime in that... we all seem to think it\u2019s worth living, or we seem to find good things. (client responds) And you\u2019re so sure it\u2019s not, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">there aren\u2019t, or at least a part of you is... which, I guess, is kind of a dominant force, you know, the lead vocal. (client affirms) And also, clearly, very separate from other people, I think. (client affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I think one of the hardest things is though like, it\u2019s... it feels like... it sort of feels like, if James loved me, he would just not make me keep living. (therapist affirms) You know like, all of the things that people do, to take care of me, you feel like the opposite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: I see. Really. All of us, and especially James, should just be letting you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">(pause 00:27:47 to 00:28:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">Yeah, it makes me think of like... one of those patients with a terminal, I don\u2019t know, cancer or something, who are... you know, terrible quality of life, but, you know, there is all this life support and all this... sort of effort of whatever kind to... I mean, it\u2019s not almost like this but, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">keep him alive for those two months or something. (client affirms) Painful procedures and, you know, whatever medication, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe that\u2019s how both of my dad\u2019s parents died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: You know, just... a lot of family who really didn\u2019t, weren\u2019t ready for them to die and (therapist affirms)... yeah. You know, I heard my dad got pretty upset about it like (therapist affirms), and so of course, then he was like fighting with his siblings over it. (therapist affirms) (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">Yeah, that\u2019s sort of what it feels like. (therapist affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">(pause 00:29:18 to 00:29:48)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Well, in some ways, it\u2019s probably worse for you, actually, because... you know, with them... it\u2019s probably pretty clear that like, at least everybody could somewhat see the other side, or that there was another side. You know what I mean? Like (client affirms)... even if his siblings weren\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">ready to let them go, they could at least appreciate that it wasn\u2019t crazy to think (client chuckles) \u201cOkay, you know, let\u2019s stop and think about this.\u201d (client affirms) Whereas...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562084\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: And for me like... I have to... like, it seems very important to maintain the understanding that like, \u201cNo it is actually crazy to be thinking this way.\u201d (therapist affirms) Like... both in terms of what other people think like, and I have to believe that, or I have to tell myself that. (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">responds) (pause) Because you know, if I stopped, (whispers) then I might just kill myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">(pause 00:30:51 to 00:31:26)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I see; so that really is pretty impossible like... um... (pause) like... (pause) like that part of you that wants to kill yourself pretty much just has that one demand. (pause) And I guess maybe like... (inaudible) are arguments for it. And the words like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think of all of that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">as crazy.\u201d (client affirms) (pause) Or... it\u2019s in charge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) A lot of the time, the things are like, worst sort of later at night... (therapist affirms) And so like, one of the things that I do is I will just say like, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just go to sleep instead. Just go to sleep. We\u2019ll just... do that...,\u201d which works pretty well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">When I can\u2019t go to sleep, then it gets really bad. (chuckles) (therapist affirms) But it sort of feels like... yeah, it feels like... trying to compromise with this like... very insistent and uncompromising desire. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: (pause) Like the way an addict would want something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess I\u2019d think of somebody who, you know, wants a drink or... cigarette... or wants whatever else and... um... It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s about anything else. You know, it\u2019s not about... (client affirms) \u201cOh, I\u2019m just feeling so awful and I need to drink, you know, to make it go away.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">I mean, I guess it could be that, but it\u2019s more like, \u201cI just want, I just need a drink it right now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah. Well, and the thing that makes me think of is like... so, you know, people will like, drink soda or chew gum or like, all these things are not in any way the thing that they actually (therapist affirms) want, but it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d (therapist affirms) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: (pause) But it\u2019s different from... (pause) I mean, I guess I have heard like, I could talk about a different lead on it (ph). They might say, somebody might say, you know, \u201cOh, my God! I just need a drink or a smoke or whatever.\u201d Somebody else might say, \u201cWell, my head just feels so bad,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">or \u201cI had to get something done and I knew I just was not going to be able to do it unless...\u201d (client affirms) or \u201cI was just feeling so awful and whatever, I mean, the only thing that will make me feel any better\u201d (client affirms). Just a little like, just sort of a step removed from... (pause) you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">know... \u201cAll I can think about or all I want... is to have a drink.\u201d (client affirms) You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And it sounds like that\u2019s more what it\u2019s like for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) Because I mean, the reason that like, I do go to sleep, the reason that I can is like, you know, I need whatever is going on in my brain to stop. (pause) And so... yeah.
