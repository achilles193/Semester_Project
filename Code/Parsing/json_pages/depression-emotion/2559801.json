It was kind of like it was going to be like just way too complicated and expensive and you might have to take like state exams and that doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea.

(PAUSE) Although it\u2019s, you know... (PAUSE) My sisters in law, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to be kindred spirits. I\u2019ve grown to really love and appreciate them and also... They\u2019re just a divide. Like I don\u2019t know. We just don\u2019t have... We don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">think anything alike. (PAUSE) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Which is hard. You know, especially like the older sister Vivienne is... We actually do have a lot of the same interests in common which is (inaudible) feel really sad whenever we talk about them. She was an English teacher also and like loves literature but (PAUSE) doesn\u2019t love any of the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">literature that I do and like... (PAUSE) Yeah. From my perspective, doesn\u2019t think about it terribly analytically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">Then I feel guilty for thinking that way. But we like talk about the (inaudible at 00:05:11) And Jessica (ph) will not stop giving me advice which I don\u2019t... It just drives me nuts. (PAUSE) You know, in some ways, like she probably should give me advice. At this point, advice about the kids. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">she\u2019s got a two year old who is hilarious (inaudible at 00:05:55: putting her stuffed giraffe in time out. \u201cAnd why are you putting Gigi (ph) in time out?\u201d \u201cBecause she said bitch.\u201d (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559801\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: \u201cDo we say bitch?

Which is I think a pretty good way to deal with swearing and kids, you know, like, \u201cThat\u2019s just not your word.\u201d (PAUSE) James and I had a pretty big fight the other night which was good. It helped us talk more about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">not being where we wanted to be together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">You know, I think (inaudible at 00:07:15) to be someone who I can talk to anymore which that\u2019s a bad thing. (LAUGHTER) So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Umm... (PAUSE) So from James\u2019 perspective, I think it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t really talk to me about his work anymore. He hasn\u2019t been talking to me about this, you know, the process of figuring out what to do next very much. And I think... (PAUSE) (SIGH) You know, I think there was a long time where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">I just really wasn\u2019t able to have a conversation. That\u2019s what it feels like to him. I think he\u2019s worried that... He\u2019s been very in that habit of not bothering me with logistics or not asking me to help deal with logistics. It\u2019s, you know... Or that it will be too much for me. For me I feel like... (SIGH) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">(PAUSE) I can\u2019t tell whether I am more sensitive than usual or whether James is more dismissive than usual. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">But I feel like when... (PAUSE) And I also can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s just like I need to be right more than usual or that he\u2019s more vehement than usual in telling me that I\u2019m wrong all the time. But it\u2019s just like... I feel like when I try to talk to him about things that I am worried about like I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">like my feelings end up getting hurt a lot (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:10:09) (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the summation of our fight would be James saying, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m so angry at you because you left me and I\u2019m really glad that you didn\u2019t kill yourself but that\u2019s a pretty tough minimum standard. Like it\u2019s not a great minimum.\u201d And me saying, \u201cYou know, I feel like I deserve a medal <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">for not killing myself. So... (LAUGHTER) I\u2019m feeling pretty good about that actually.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">Yeah... (PAUSE) I\u2019m sort of at the point where I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWell, okay. If he\u2019s going to continue to get angry about me and about this, I need...\u201d (PAUSE) You know, he needs to look for ways I could make it better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">Because I feel like I\u2019m just doing everything that I can to make things better. I mean, not everything I can but everything I can think of and can handle. (PAUSE) You know, it\u2019s like he\u2019s been very clear, we\u2019ve both been very clear that the way that I can take care of us as a couple right now is to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">take care of myself and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know what to do. I want that to be enough.

(PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:15:51) certainly thinking and sort of cautiously saying, \u201cWe need to get back into marriage counseling.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, no. This really needs to happen.\u201d (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">Like I need to make this happen.

(PAUSE) We had a conversation earlier that day (PAUSE) about kind of (inaudible at 00:20:39) cost and I was thinking about someone had referred to like their, that people thought that the like, the hypomania coming from bipolar <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">too, thought of it as a pastoral gift. They were like, \u201cOh, ha, ha. That\u2019s really sad.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

For (inaudible at 00:21:33) like her manic periods are a time of like intense work and where she does really good work. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">worth the price. I think she should get treatment for it. Like I don\u2019t...

That\u2019s how the world works. And so then like that conversation had been done like the end of the night. It was very late. And I, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">know, made some reference to my being (inaudible at 00:22:41) He was like, \u201cWell, every gift comes with a price.\u201d And it really, really hurt my feelings a lot.
