data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">(laughter and inaudible conversation)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: No turkey day was \u2013 we drove to my parents in (inaudible at 00:00:17) which is over near Dunlap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Just\u2014I call it Carmi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: (laughs) (inaudible at 00:00:27) I don\u2019t think I have heard of (inaudible). Were they hit by any of the kind of tornado stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Five miles away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I actually had a cousin \u2013 she and her husband and their newborn made it to the basement but the house was wiped out. And my little brother \u2013 younger brother \u2013 who was on his way to an auto parts store and is rolling into the town as the tornado was coming through. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And he couldn\u2019t decide which way it was coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: He ended up turning and the tornado chased him. This tornado was travelling at sixty miles an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh goodness gracious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: He was flying down the highway at like a hundred and ten trying to out run it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Trying to get away from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And so it was interesting. So we had some stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I bet!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Stories to tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Everyone is okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah you know with the amount of damage that happened in that little town there was only like one death I think. That was related to the tornado. So. Yeah. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: How is it for you when you get together with your family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah I was trying to pay attention to that. I think what I\u2019ve kind of recognized is that over the years it\u2019s gotten more comfortable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Now it\u2019s expanding so now it\u2019s like my siblings\u2019 children are \u2013 they\u2019re all the ages \u2013. Probably the youngest right now is like grade school. So my younger sister, who is eleven years younger than me, her youngest is still is grade school but the vast majority of kids are all kind of clumped <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">together in that college age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: And moving on. Some of them are starting to bring home boyfriend\/girlfriend kind of thing. So. Yeah it\u2019s quite a little bit less drama.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: And those kind of things. So I was just noting that quality of it. You know, for the day. So yeah. So I was trying to be mindful of what was going on in terms of like quality of conversation. You know, those kind of things that were happening. It was interesting that\u2014 I have three younger brothers. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">And we\u2019re all within about a year, year and a half apart. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: In terms of age. So we were just kind of clustered together. And at one point it became apparent that we\u2019re all in the same boat. Even though we weren\u2019t like having that conversation, it was enough bits of pieces of conversation where it\u2019s like we\u2019re all in the same boat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Explain all in the same boat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well you know just that sense of like we\u2019re middle age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Kids are growing up and moving out. And we\u2019re finding ourselves in relationships that are like, \u201cYeah.\u201d We\u2019re just looking at each other. It\u2019s like the words don\u2019t even really need to be said or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Was that comforting for you? Or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: No I don\u2019t know about comforting. You know other \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Does one feel comforted when \u2013 it\u2019s not this bad, I\u2019m just saying \u2013 when you\u2019re not the only guy in line for the gallows? (laughing) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561256\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well at least you\u2019re not alone!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah exactly. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But what sort of brought you to that place? Because I don\u2019t get the impression that\u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Oh my younger brother \u2013 my youngest brother has a relationship which is really pretty difficult. His wife was diagnosed after they were married with bipolar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: And it seemed like \u2013 when they had kids that seemed to really exasperate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: And she\u2019s really been \u2013 she\u2019s got substance abuse issues and bipolar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s been a couple of years since we\u2019ve seen her at any family functions. She just doesn\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And was she there this time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: And then he\u2019s got two \u2013 twins and they are probably twenty, twenty-one years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: And they had really incredibly good grades. They were like top ten of the students in high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: But \u2013 I think they even had potential scholarships to different colleges but they sort of \u2013 they (inaudible at 00:06:01). They\u2019re really pretty tight. They hang together. (sighs) And one of them is really into tattoos and piercings and it\u2019s almost \u2013 my brother. You can sort of see that like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">one of twins is kind of following Mom\u2019s path. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s probably not going to be really surprising if he ends up bipolar. And the other one \u2013 maybe not so much. So but I think he\u2019s \u2013 my youngest brother \u2013 is feeling a lot of depression. You could really see it on his face. So it was just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Oh would it be something you would consider building a connection with him around? Or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: I think we\u2019ve tried. I think of all my brothers that he and I probably are the least \u2013 we\u2019ve had the least connection over the years. But we\u2019ve had a couple of conversations in regards to that relationship and his relationship with his wife. Yeah I think there is just sort of this sense of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200831\">he\u2019s not sure what to do. But I think that \u2013 you know I started \u2013 he was using words like \u201cdivorce\u201d a little bit. Maybe not divorce but \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah or indicating, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer this is going to last.\u201d Kind of thing. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So as much as he was open to that I was trying to start a couple of different conversations with him. Whether or not it was \u2013 the fact that we were in a relatively crowded space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Right. Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: You\u2019re not going to have a really intimate conversation. So I felt was it that or he just didn\u2019t want to go there and wasn\u2019t really sure about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But we\u2019ve talked about it\u2019s hard to make connections for you. Especially connections with other men. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: And I wonder if \u2013 and this may not be the case because sometimes when a relationship is kind of set sometimes it\u2019s kind of set. But other times not. And I wonder \u2013 as you kind of look around the table at your brothers who you feel are in similar places and you kind of get it \u2013 that there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200951\">are so few people who get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: You know because from the outside most people are healthy and everybody is doing what they\u2019re doing.

Not just you but it sounds like your brother and (inaudible at 00:09:04) as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah it could be. Yeah it could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: What would it be like for you to try to build a bridge there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah I think that that\u2019s really \u2013 yeah I don\u2019t see that as \u2013. The only problem is just the geographical distance and the time kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: I have one younger brother that I\u2019m probably a little bit closer \u2013 is that your phone? Oh okay \u2013 that we\u2019ve been able to sort of maintain a kind of relationship but the other two not at much.

It\u2019s been there for me. I recognized that over the holiday, when my kids were at home, I was starting to tap into some feelings that I hadn\u2019t had for a while. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: It was like okay.

And it\u2019s like I recognized that in the past that was just kind of this place of like kicking into kind of a depression. I don\u2019t know if it was a seasonal kind of thing. That was a pattern. I know that that pattern \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Where you would get kind of depressed from the holidays?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: Kind of depressed and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m not really sure that I ever had any resolve to that or whatever.

Yeah. It was \u2013 I was in a slightly different place in that I was able to kind of step aside from it and be able to observe what was happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. What was happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">CLIENT: Mm. I\u2019m not necessarily sure I have \u2013 other than I knew that there was some depression. I knew that there was some frustration. The sensation or those feelings of loneliness. Kind of being outside of what\u2019s going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">CLIENT: Feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">THERAPIST: So you felt depressed and lonely. Sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And so I think that I kind of got into that place where I was just kind of quiet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">CLIENT: Kind of like whatever.

Let go of trying to be ten years old or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201871\">whatever.

Four boys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201FF\">CLIENT: Yeah then they were starting to warm up to the idea of hugging. And it wasn\u2019t until my brother, one of my brothers, brought home his fianc\u00e9e who was just like, \u201cWe all hug. This is what normal people do.\u201d And she forced the family to hug each other kind of thing. And it\u2019s become a more commonplace <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201FF1\">occurrence.

(laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20225\">THERAPIST: And in some ways if you read some of the literature on intimacy and male intimacy, men need it even more. Especially heterosexual men because they don\u2019t get touched except by their wives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20227\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20229\">THERAPIST: Right. Heterosexual married men I should say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2022B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2022D\">THERAPIST: Gay men are better at it. They can touch each other. Right? But heterosexual men there is this stigma of being gay. And so women can touch each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2022F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20231\">THERAPIST: And so this is one of the reasons why sex for married, heterosexual men becomes even more important because the only place they get touched and physically validated is \u2013 you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20233\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20235\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s been missing for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20237\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20239\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Which is one of the reasons why some of the loneliness is justified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2023B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that even when touch and sexuality was a part of the relationship, there was even then \u2013 and I don\u2019t know how far back we have to go. Maybe it was there from the beginning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2023F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure. Not \u2013 and it was clearly a continuum or \u2013 but there was just that sense of \u2013. At some point you begin to recognize that it\u2019s like this person doesn\u2019t want you to touch her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20241\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20243\">CLIENT: Or there is this uncomfortableness.

Um, I don\u2019t know. Um. (pause at 00:29:43 until 00:29:50) Yeah I think that it just became kind of this unspoken rule or unspoken condition that affection just sort of became a \u2013 physical affection of any kind \u2013 really just became uncomfortable. (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20249\">THERAPIST: And uncomfortable on her part? On your part?

I think for me it\u2019s like whether it was \u2013 and there was certainly a kind of a spoken discussion or a verbal discussion about no more sex.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20285\">THERAPIST: Because being the good guy in your mind is somehow an important thing to do.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20289\">THERAPIST: As opposed to saying, \u201cHold the hell up!

It\u2019s like she\u2019s in love with an image of me that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20335\">THERAPIST: How does that feel to say? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20337\">CLIENT: It feels \u2013 again. It feels lonely. And it\u2019s like \u2013 hey this is me. I\u2019m here now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20339\">THERAPIST: What is that image of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not back there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033D\">THERAPIST: And who are you back there different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033F\">CLIENT: Oh I don\u2019t know. The me that was back there. The me that was in college. The me that was whatever. I\u2019m \u2013 difficult to maybe even remember. But it\u2019s like \u2013 you know there is like things that have happened along the way. It\u2019s like well you know I\u2019ve had these issues with my stomach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20341\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20343\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t eat meat anymore. And I don\u2019t drink alcohol anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20345\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20347\">CLIENT: But she\u2019s in love with the guy that still wants to sit down and have a couple of gin and tonics with her every night. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20349\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034B\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like \u2013 and I know. It\u2019s not spoken but it\u2019s felt. And it\u2019s like why can\u2019t you be that guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034F\">CLIENT: You know and it\u2019s like \u2013 so that\u2019s yeah. That\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20351\">THERAPIST: Very hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20353\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like dammit. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20355\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:23)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20357\">CLIENT: You know? (laughing) I just need somebody to see me. Can you just see me? You know? I feel like the invisible man sometimes. It\u2019s like \u2013 yeah whatever. There\u2019s a number of different science fiction metaphors I could probably pick on but \u2013.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20359\">THERAPIST: You know I see it sometimes go across your face. How much it hurts to not be seen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035B\">CLIENT: Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah so I think that I carry that\u2013 I certainly carry it through the doors here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like \u2013 I think one of the things that I\u2019m finding somewhat surprising is that people see me here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20361\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s different \u2013 how do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20363\">CLIENT: (sighs) I don\u2019t know exactly. But I\u2019m \u2013 there is a certain sense of like people are starting \u2013. I\u2019ve been in the program long enough now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20365\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20367\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:45:22) it\u2019s like people call me by name. It\u2019s like \u2013 a little bit. I mean it\u2019s not like you\u2019re seeing these people on a daily basis. It\u2019s difficult to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20369\">THERAPIST: How does it feel to be seen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2036B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like I like hanging out here. It\u2019s nice to be a part of something. It\u2019s nice to feel like your ideas count. Who you are matters. The things that you care about matter. And it\u2019s like that\u2019s \u2013 yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2036D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like and a lot of (inaudible at 00:45:57) students feel that way.

I might actually jump.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2037D\">THERAPIST: Well you are not (client laughing), you are not unknowable nor are you unlovable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2037F\">CLIENT: No and I think that part of that path I recognize.

You\u2019ve talked about being in silos and the force field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20397\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20399\">THERAPIST: And once you\u2019ve been together for a really long time you have \u2013 a lot of times accurate, sometimes not \u2013 a representation of who you think someone is and it doesn\u2019t leave them room to break out of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039D\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t leave room to be different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039F\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A1\">THERAPIST: There is a movie \u2013 and I can\u2019t remember the name of it. It came out maybe a year ago. Two years. With Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. What was it called?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A3\">CLIENT: Oh I saw it. Yeah. I did not see that movie but I was like \u2013 my wife and I saw the previews and I\u2019m like, \u201cI can\u2019t go there. That\u2019s our relationship.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A9\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re Meryl Streep and she\u2019s Tommy Lee Jones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AB\">CLIENT: Yeah and again I didn\u2019t see the movie. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AD\">THERAPIST: I wonder if that\u2019s something you should think about. First you should see it yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B1\">THERAPIST: But I wonder if it\u2019s something you should watch together. Not now. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B5\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s in some ways it\u2019s a message to anyone who is in a long-term relationship or a marital relationship because all of us are vulnerable to that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B9\">THERAPIST: As you saw you went home and you saw your brothers living parts of your experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203BD\">THERAPIST: Right? Because all of us are vulnerable to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203BF\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203C1\">THERAPIST: You know you have a voice here. And you\u2019ve been told for so long that you can\u2019t use it or can\u2019t speak. You\u2019re screaming from the outside. But anytime \u2013 at least since we\u2019ve been working together \u2013 you even you said know or you\u2019ve spoken a little bit of your truth it has not been the disaster <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203C11\">that you feared it would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N203C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561256\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C3\">CLIENT: No I don\u2019t think it is.

When the rubber hits the road \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C9\">THERAPIST: Of course.

Before \u2013 I\u2019m not suggesting you write the letter at this point. And if you did I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you give it to her. But I wonder if you thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203CD1\">about writing her a letter so you could say anything you have ever wanted to say about the relationship or how much you hurt or the lack of physical or emotional \u2013 like what would it be like for you to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CF\">CLIENT: (pause at 00:50:30 until 00:50:36) Um probably the best \u2013 the first thought that comes to mind is like somebody who has just been\u2014.
