All right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay, cool. Awesome.

I'm in much better shape than I was in the previous tool set.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh, cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: The logic I'm using is much tighter and better distributed. It's really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well, cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's been neat figuring out where to take pieces and move them, and... I was having a hard time making all these six different objects work together in a unit. [0:00:53] So I just built another object to tell them all what to do instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: It's like, oh, it's your turn (inaudible at 0:00:58). And it's like, okay, I'm done with my turn. Okay, great, so then I guess it's your turn now. And it's better. It's very nice. It's [real simple to manage it] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: And it's interesting. You have to build all these little machines to run all these little functions. So you have to get the click manager. So it's like, whenever someone clicks, it's like, okay, wait, what did you click on? And it's like, well, was it one of these three things? Was it a person <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">or an enemy or a bug? It's like, no. Okay, fine. Keep listening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:01:35) whatever you click on. It's like, I clicked on a... I clicked on something. Okay, great, cool. So was that an enemy? It's like, yeah, it was an enemy. Great, okay, cool. Who's the active agent right now? It's like, oh, this player is the active one. Okay, great, in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">case, he's going to attack first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And that just kind of works through the entire (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: There's a whole kind of logic you've got to follow. [0:01:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and machines talking to machines...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Just being like, you do this thing. It's very cool. It's like when I say, activate, you do the following thing. If I say end a turn, you do this other thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: And it's just all very quickly... and this is not revolutionary stuff. But this is... what is great about this is that this is visual coding. As soon as you took coding and you made it visual [for me] (ph), it's so much easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Oh, right, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's so much easier. I can just look at it. One of the biggest hurdles I often had in trying to do regular programming, besides [all that you learn is] (ph) tedious syntax, which is always slightly different based on which language you're using. And it's easy to mess up. You have to look <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">at the (inaudible at 0:02:40) vision thing. And... but the real issue was structuring it in my head, trying to imagine what this thing looked like. And they get very quick at it and huge. [0:02:56] Then I'm having just pictures and flow charts and arrows and their transitions. It's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: It's like, ah. I can move things around. I literally move them around on the screen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's still doing the same kind of logical pattern without all the syntax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes, it's all the exact same logic. Yeah, it's all the exact same logic. It's just a different way of viewing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: You're inputting information, arranging information to input. And it's far superior for me. And I would have a lot more... I am limited in a sense, in that the tool set only has so many actions. But it has a lot of actions, and they cover basically anything you'd want to do. There's [a few] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">(ph) situations where it doesn't. For instance, being original (inaudible at 0:03:39), it doesn't handle arrays. Do you know what an array is in code?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, I don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: It's a list. It's a list. It can be one to three dimensional. It can have X, Y, and Z values.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Okay. [0:03:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: But usually you'd use an X. The one dimensional one with an X. You're like, okay, there are eight indices in this, labeled zero to seven. And there's something in each one of those. And then it's a matter of saying, hey, array, what's in your third X? It's like, oh, it's this thing. Great, in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">that case... and this is where you store information (inaudible at 0:04:14).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: It's like, I need to know this at this point. And you use it with all sorts of things. But System doesn't actually do them because you can't really make a picture of an array very efficiently. I mean, you can build one in the system, but it's this huge structure (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: So it's like, oh, let's do that. But someone was like, oh, I just made arrays. He's like, I made arrays for seven (ph). Here it is. You import it. (inaudible at 0:04:40) great. So you just take it, and you put it in. Not only will it help you make stuff that you probably needed already, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">you can also... if you can code or if you can figure out how to code it or get someone to code it for you, you can write (ph) new actions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: So it's offensible (ph). So it's this amazing system. [0:04:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And then there's a community that helps you (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, totally. You're like, how do I do this thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: And that actually came up. I really was struggling with this one thing. And it seemed so simple. I want the dude to move across the screen to another dude. And then he collides with that dude to do something, even more...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: To do something when he... after he collides?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, to take some action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: So... but I want also to happen then is, while he's moving, he hits something else, and that thing is another enemy. He stops there, and hits that thing instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Doesn't seem particularly difficult. Remarkably difficult to get to happen. And I kept searching for it. And all these threads are people being like, I can't do this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Why can't I do this thing? People are like, oh, maybe try this thing and this thing. People are having various levels of success. (Pause) I was like, this is ridiculous. And then I found a way it could work by ray casting instead (pause), which would be cool. [0:06:02] But then I'm like, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200831\">the amount of work I'd have to go through to learn ray casting and to implement ray casting, is it actually worth that (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: What you want (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. If what I really want to happen is they have to take out the guys in front before they can get to the guys in back unless you're the wizard, in which case you don't shoot anybody. And so what I did instead is, I was like, okay, when you click on a target, added a step (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">at 0:06:20) okay, is it an enemy? Yes. Okay, is it a legal target? And to evaluate that it says, is it on this side of the screen, the left-hand screen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: And [if it's no I can't do anything with it] (ph). I just keep listening for a click...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: If yes, just attack. So very nice. And then I was trying to figure out how to get the wizard to shoot. And I was like, okay, so I've got to put a switch in here, it's like, if it's the wizard doing it (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Wow, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: But then I'm like, oh, what I can actually just do is take that step of game advantage out of the loop in the combat manager and put a unique copy of it into every single unit essentially. [0:06:59] So they can all handle that step differently. So yeah, just taking your transplant essentially. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">It's like, one organ goes into every body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: And you can change the organ once it gets there to do different things or come about its results differently. The end result is always damage to an enemy hopefully. Well, yeah, that's not true. I'm expanding that, so there's always some end result with taking an action on some other object and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">getting... and putting the ability to handle that on each individual person will make a lot more sense, and it works so much better. So in any case...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: But yeah, each step was a little puzzle you had to figure out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, every single step, every single thing. I'm always like, okay, once I do this, the next thing will be easy. But I'm like, no, the next thing will be the same thing (inaudible at 0:07:48) if I don't learn it. Okay, so how do I do this? And what's great is I can learn it. Everything is documented...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:07:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Not terribly well, but there's people talking about it. People make YouTube videos, like, here, I'm doing this specific thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's pretty common. It's like, here's the thing where you get a key card. And if you have the key card, you put it into this pedestal. And that lights, and then you need a different key card for that pedestal. And if you light them both up the door opens. It's like, okay, great, simple, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">common things. They're like, here's how you set up triggers to do various things. Great stuff, all sorts of stuff. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Using a specific programming tool box.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: What's it called, the program?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: program is the toolset, and System is the add on that makes it visual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. And program is extremely popular. And the version I have is now free actually, which is nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: I paid for it four years ago, but... because they put the new version out which is better.

[0:08:59] But the realization that I can do that... it's really... it's the one... there's one thing I really took from working that job(sp?)... or rather the one thing he once said that actually really I kept, because it seemed important, was, people were saying, why <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">didn't you go to these Providence post mortem venues and looking for new people in the industry? He's like, really, all these people are going there trying to get jobs in the industry. He's like, if you're into games, you should just make games instead of asking for permission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: And that's actually a very true point, because the industry is very competitive, the spots. And once you get to a company there's no, let's make your game. It's the guy at the top, let's make his game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, he's... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: He's got to know... he started a game company because he has games he wants to make, and he's going to make those games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Right, exactly. [0:09:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: There's a huge indie market now, it's totally viable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: And with Pete backing the original version of this, should be able to get some amount of cash out of it. Any amount of cash would be great, which would then allow us to start in with Kickstarter for the next one, which potentially could... so this is if everything goes well. This is a great scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: That's wonderful (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Give yourself a chance (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I really am. I should have done this four years ago, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: You're also... it sounds like you're also just developing a pretty good skill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Useful skill? Yeah. Totally. I mean, I can put it on a resume, program and system. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Is that right? That'll all be something that's...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'll put it on my resume. And that'll... depending on where I apply that'll mean something. But the thing is, being like, oh, no, sorry, I won't program in System, is not going to be an issue for much longer. [0:10:56] A lot of places in other industries would be like, no, we code with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">code. But even eventually with them, like, no, no, we code in code. But also for most things you do there's this visual system. And it doesn't do it, building in code and put it into the visual system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: It's no big deal. So really soon what coding will be is your ability to think through logic problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: That's just it. It's like, how do you solve a problem, which is mostly what it is now. It's how you solve the problem in a specific language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: No, that's interesting, right, because it's like you're adding... it's almost like you're noticing that the syntax part of it is a whole different kind of skill set that might become obsolete (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. I mean, except maybe for a very few people who want to continue to keep it at the machine level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: But especially when we get processes that can do stuff fast enough that, even being so far a stretch from the screen language, it's still fast enough with the actual noticeable difference to our minds between binary speed and visual speed...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. [0:12:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: Would be (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you point out that's one of the big differences about speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: That's the big difference is... yeah. And it depends, I mean, in terms of what you're going to try to do. But that's okay. You can make games in system. And I think it's really well suited to making 2D games, which are generally lower power anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: And so... [and are you going to] (ph) make 3D games in it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: It might be (inaudible at 0:12:30) 3D.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: It might be, I don't know. I mean, it may not be any significant difference at this point. (Chuckling) we may happen to be at the point where it doesn't matter so much. But again the market will still veer to the software (ph) puzzles, and that's exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: So the latest Halo, what did they use to program it? [0:12:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Oh, they own proprietary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: They make their own engine out of something, C# or C++ or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe they have some JavaScript in places and stuff, but I don't know. (Pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Totally. So... but they build their own (inaudible at 0:13:09), is what they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: That's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: But program is like, [hey, anything you develop] (ph) (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Then you develop on program, okay, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: It's a full-power, professional tool to make professional level games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's kind of like what I guess they did in the music industry. Everybody can make their own... really have studio level equipment (inaudible at 0:13:34).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. People make stuff. That's the...post-scarcity society. What can you do with the brain? There you go. I was watching this great thing on TED. I love fucking TED talks. I subscribed to them recently because I was like, why would I not subscribe to these? They're brilliant. [0:13:56] And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201131\">you keep seeing... this guy's talking about the role of robots in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: And how... he's like, robots will be taking care of us. He's like, there will be more of us who are old than who are working. He's like, more of us will be old than there are who are working adults. And he's like, well, another thing is that even the caregivers are older. People who are taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">care of old people are older than they used to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: He's like, so robots will really have to take over this level of care. And he's like, bipedal robots that take your groceries in and things like that. And hopefully someday, once they can feed the very deathly ill and watch their face when they're ready for more, see if they've swallowed, receive <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B1\">all that and then offer more...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Interesting. [0:14:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So they built a robot. He's like, this big problem factor of ours is they're incredibly dangerous. They have no understanding or awareness of where you are. You can't really predict what they're going to do unless you know the pattern. But they also move incredibly quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: They move... they do move...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, they can move very quickly. There are specific (inaudible at 0:15:16) can do stuff now. So... quickly enough that they're dangerous. He's like, so that's a problem. And so he's built something new. It's got a base it stands on, but it's got a torso, a head, and two arms with pincers. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">And the head is an iPad screen with these two cartoon eyes on it. And the eyes look at what it's doing. (inaudible at 0:15:47) its eyes literally go like this, pick it up, and it looks where it's going to put it, puts it down. And so now you know as a human. You're like, ah, those are its intentions. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201232\">That's what it's doing... [0:15:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20122-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20122-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: By looking at the eyes. You see the eyes and now like, oh, that's what it's doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you've figured out... that's how you predict behavior and movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: Right. So it also has great force (ph) sensors. So if it touches you it stops. It's like, oh, I'm sorry, there's resistance. I'm not supposed to walk through things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: Also you can take things out of the pincers while it's in the middle of doing stuff. It knows not to resist that. It's like, oh, okay, do you want that? You can just have it, you can have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Yeah, so somebody pull...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah, if somebody has to pull something out of its claws, it's going to be fine. So that's all cool. But the most impressive thing is that you teach it. So this guy goes around to one of the arms and pushes a button on the arm, which makes the arm go into zero gravity mode. Essentially it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201331\">easy to move, but it stays where you put it. So... and he gives it a cup, and he closes the pincers on the cup, so it's holding the cup. [0:16:56] And it's like, this is an object. And it's like, okay, got it. I see it, I know how it feels, okay, I recognize it. He's like, great. He takes the arm and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201332\">draws the screen... the eyes move to the corner of the screen, it shows the interface. And he uses the arm to draw on the screen what the physical space (inaudible at 0;17:14) the area in which to look for that cup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: And then he shows it... he puts it through the motion he wants it to do. He's like, pick it up, move it here, you're going to drop it in this receptacle. He's like, and that's your motion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: He does that how? He does...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: He just moves the arm around. (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: He takes the... actually grabs the arm...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: He's like, now you're here. I want you to do this. Now you're here, I want you to do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: Really? Wow. And that's programming it when he does (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah, but then it learns how to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Holy cow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: And then it spends its time learning how to do that action until it gets it right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... now they put these factories. They're trying to put these in factories. And this woman in her 50s working in an assembly line, they gave it to her, they explained how it worked. And within an hour she'd already programmed it to do these menial tasks that took her more time than they <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B1\">were really worth essentially in terms of how her brain power could be spent. [0:18:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Oh, huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: So her productivity goes up, and she's like, it's a tool, Kylie (sp?). This robot is a tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: And I think that's something that he's mentioned is that, robots will replace certain jobs, but they will become tools in other jobs. He's like, Excel made accounting better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: Made what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: Accounting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: You've got Excel.

[0:18:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: That's something, though, those robots, to try to make them more responsive to humans like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah. Already... yeah, and they have to be. And they really have to for us to work with them, because we have to understand what they're doing.

And as we do this, as we can teach them more and more complex things, really the question is going to be, what's the difference? What's the difference? As they start having complex enough thoughts that... even though it will <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F1\">be programmed, all the ability to have those thoughts, and you program the decision-making [you need to do this] (ph), and it's like, yeah, we built all that. But now it is running, and it's making decisions. And then the question comes up. It's like... (Pause) Maybe it's like the vegetarian (ph) question, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F2\">and I can't remember what it is. [0:19:58] It's some sort of quote about, it's like, it's not so much we should be thinking, do the animals think and have personal lives? He's like, you should be thinking, can they feel pain? Do they suffer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: It's like, that's really the question, and that'll be the question with robots.

Yeah, well, eventually, because all that they're doing now is simulating emotions in robots. There's an Einstein that they made, and they put it (inaudible at 0:20:39) robot. But it's a Hollywood-level mask, so it's pretty good quality. But it's got servos (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B1\">that read your emotion on your face and adapt to that... [0:20:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: To try and mirror your state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: And it's eerie, because they really put in little things that are like, huh, okay. Like, it does tiny little things that are human. There's this one robot that look at you and really listens to you and gives the impression that it's interested in what you're saying. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I guess the question, is it real? At what level is it real?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: At what point does it become real? At which point does it become a being? At which point does it become a being? When it can tell you if it is? And that's the thing. (Chuckling) When it just says, oh yeah, by the way, I am this, it's like, well, what would you mean? What do you mean? When we <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201871\">can ask them, what do you mean by that...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20186-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20186-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: I don't know, they'll have created a race. We've created a legacy. As a species we have created another species which will be able to evolve even faster. Or can it? Or can it? There's got to be a limit. So we will be able to engineer ourselves. We're already capable of doing it in small ways, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F1\">but ourselves, really ourselves, not just mice and junk (ph). To improve, to be better, we change our DNA. And... to make each of us a great expression of what a human can be. Everyone is born an Adonis, I mean, and... or an Aphrodite (inaudible at 0:22:46). Everyone is born perfect biologically. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F2\">think we're coming to that point. [0:22:54] And the thing about Gattaca was the... I love Gattaca, but the problem with Gattaca...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: The Ethan Hawke? Yeah. [0:23:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: Yeah. The problem with Gattaca is (pause), in the world we've created, you really can't do that, because he's like, no, I'm not genetically engineered to be amazing. But I can still do these things. It's like, no, you can't. You actually are not good enough. You'll never be as smart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: It's like, you'll never be as smart, you'll never be as strong, you'll never be as... have as much endurance...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: You'll never have any of these things. But the fact that you would go to space, you would trick your way into the space program as an astronaut...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Endanger so many people, endangers all those other astronauts who are good enough to be there, who are operating at a level higher than you are.

It's... Gattaca wouldn't work. You couldn't do it. You absolutely could not do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Why? What's the...? [0:23:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: Well, I don't know if you know the... so the premise of it is that Ethan Hawke is born right around the time that genetic engineering becomes a thing. And so his parents go... he's born (ph), they read his... sorry, they're like, okay, we can genetically fix some stuff in your son before he's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A71\">born. They're like, oh, we want to have him naturally. So they have a natural baby, they look at his DNA when he's born. Like, okay, he'll probably live to be about 37, 48, somewhere in that range. He's got his various things. Like, these are all the health problems he'll have through the course of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A72\">his life. These are the maximum things he'll achieve in these areas. And they're like, oh, okay. And they don't give him the father's name as they were about to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: They don't give the father's...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: Name to the baby, Ethan Hawke. The second child they have genetically engineered, and he's far superior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Who's that played by?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: Some guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Was it like Jude Law or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: No, no, (inaudible at 0:24:45). But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT: And then he tries to fake his way into NASA essentially, because all the good jobs are taken by genetically engineered people. [0:24:55] He's not genetically engineered. He has to be a janitor. That's really the highest he can achieve, is the blue collar work...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB\">CLIENT: Because they won't... they're like, no, of course not. You're just not smart enough. And he's like, no, I am. He proves to them all that he's smart enough, and he's freaking not smart enough. (Pause) (inaudible at 0:25:16) genius who lacks all the other requisite qualities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Ah, uh-huh. So he did endanger everybody because he's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it's like... it's not a great story when you get down to it. He's not really the hero. He's a reckless, selfish, sub-human...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">CLIENT: Sub-human, because human has changed at that point. The definition is now better. They're not the ubermen anymore. They are the people...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">THERAPIST: But he's still... I see, but he still wanted to reach that level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk) would reach that level and (inaudible at 0:25:44).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">THERAPIST: But he didn't have it in him to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, so he cheats his way through it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD\">THERAPIST: He cheats... yeah, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, he uses... he keeps taking... he has this buddy essentially who's rich and whatever, who switches lives with him as he has his legs broken (inaudible at 0:25:59). [0:26:00] And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">THERAPIST: That's how he gets into the whole...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. He keeps getting the guy's urine and blood samples and skin flakes and stuff, and then sprinkles it around his keyboard at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Right. Yes, that's right, I remember that, those pieces of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so... yeah. Anyhow... so that's just... that's just that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">THERAPIST: It's got the... yeah, it's got obviously the Brave New World element to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">CLIENT: We're heading there. And really, robots take care of us, we build species that takes care of us, more of us live longer and longer, older and older, genetic engineering makes that worthwhile. Now we have this race of... as perfect a human race as we are able to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">CLIENT: And we have this race of robots. [0:26:56] Now, the question I asked earlier is, could they then evolve faster than we do? And the question is, maybe they can't, I mean, because you're limited by your own capacity. It takes effort to imagine better, greater than you are. I don't know, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF1\">that's not important. But regardless the fact will be there will be two species living together on this planet and on Mars and possibly the moon and maybe eventually... definitely eventually further...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">CLIENT: As long as we don't get wiped out before we all settle on Mars. And that's the thing. That's why we get to Mars, all of a sudden the human race now exists, unless the solar system is destroyed, spread out from Mars and from earth to other places. (inaudible at 0:27:44) and we'll bring our robots <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E31\">with us, if there's even a difference at that point, if there's even a difference. [0:27:54] (Pause) (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">CLIENT: And it's funny, Bicentennial Man, not a great movie, but actually brings up some things, like, that the robot Robin Williams wants to be human, because a glitch makes him sentient. And so he's unique in that regard, the only sentient robot. And he makes synthetic skin. He makes synthetic organs <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E71\">which work better than real organs. So people get them. They get those organs replaced especially as they get older. And he makes all these adjustments to become a fully biological human being. And he's petitioning for human status, essentially to the UN. He's like, I'm a human being. I need you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E72\">call me human. They're like, ah, you're still not... you're still a robot. He's like, you're all using the same hearts that I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Mmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201EB\">CLIENT: So they eventually decide he's humans, but he dies right before...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Huh. [0:28:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201EF\">CLIENT: Or right as, they tell him. (Pause) But that raises the question, when does that difference fade? When does that line blur to the point where it makes no sense any more to ask the question? I mean, this is amazing. And we'll only see some small part of this, unless this is the generation that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201EF1\">figures out aging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F3\">CLIENT: When we figure out scarcity and aging at roughly the same time, because we have to figure out scarcity before we figure out aging. (Pause) Who knows what we'll do? Genetic engineering of live people? I don't know [if we have any idea how to do that] (ph). We'd have to do it in utero. [0:29:55] <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201F31\">But still there's gene therapy, then your DNA changes. There's a study that says your DNA changes if you don't sleep enough. It becomes different. So your DNA changes as you live. There's no reason we couldn't change it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F7\">CLIENT: But as we... technology as well. Technology. Robots technology. We'll wirelessly interface with robots with a little thing behind our ears, not even invasive. Yeah. Not even invasive. And there's this book called Old Man's War, which is really good. It's a part of a trilogy which is also good. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201F71\">But the first one's probably the best. It's about a future earth where space age relations are really good. We're on multiple planets, we've got... and we're at war. We're at war with all these various allied races all over the place. And most people are on earth. You're either on earth or you're in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201F72\">the military. [0:30:55] And that's what you know. You know there's war. You know there's a military in space. And you know there's earth. And if you want off earth you have to join the military. But they don't actually want you until you are 75 years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201FB\">CLIENT: And so you sign up at 65, and then ten years from that point you go. They take you into the military. And (pause) you go. And when you get there they're like... you get there with all these other recruits, and they're all 75 years old. And yeah, I guess we're all soldiers now. And then the very <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201FB1\">first day they sit you down across from this version of yourself, a defective version of yourself, which is green. And then they transfer your consciousness from one to the other. And they're like, now we have experienced, mature people who are our soldiers. And these soldiers are genetically engineered <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201FB2\">bodies. And they're green because of chlorophyll, because they take in nutrients from the sun as an alternate supply of nutrients.

And it turns out the reason it takes ten years, it takes them ten years <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202071\">to grow you that body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">CLIENT: And so (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">THERAPIST: When they meet you at 65, then they're growing you a body from that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020F\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And then... but sometimes this happens, someone dies before it's their time. So they have this body. (Pause) And the body has sentience, it's a person. It grows as a person. But it looks full grown, but it's only really a couple years old. [0:32:55] And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20211\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20213\">CLIENT: [But they're trained in special forces] (ph). And so this whole thing happens where she looks just like his wife, and romance happens, whatever. But he trains with them for a while, and he notices the things that are different. They know that bodies can be repaired really easily. Everyone's <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202131\">(inaudible at 0:33:15), but they've grown up knowing this. So they will sacrifice an arm in a fight to win the fight.

Four Lord of the Diamond.

You'll die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20225\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20227\">CLIENT: And these societies build up based on what these abilities are and who is better at them. And there's a conspiracy involving them somehow. So a secret agent has to go there. And he's like, I can never come back. They're like, don't worry. We're going to clone you four times...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20229\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022B\">CLIENT: And send each one of you to a different version... to a different world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022F\">CLIENT: He's like, that's great. So he goes to sleep in the cloning process, and he wakes up on the ship to the first world.

I'm supposed to be back in the ship. This should be my clone. But he is the clone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20235\">THERAPIST: He is the clone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20237\">CLIENT: And he goes and... each book is a different planet. He goes through this in each book...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20239\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023B\">CLIENT: Yeah, the same, oh shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Well, it brings up these very... I guess that's some of the critical part of science fiction, is that it brings up all these questions of what makes us human...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2023C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20241\">THERAPIST: And what...? (Chuckling) Who are we, and what are we? What's the difference...? I mean, using robots and cloning as ways to introduce the idea, yeah, and tell a story. But also it's getting at those...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20243\">CLIENT: Well, and look at this. The Star Trek teleporter problem. Most people don't think about this. You're familiar with Star Trek and the teleportation stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20245\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20247\">CLIENT: Okay. So (inaudible at 0:35:50) (crosstalk). We've talked about this, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20249\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024B\">CLIENT: So... [0:35:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Because they're not really there when they get back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, well, someone is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20251\">THERAPIST: Somebody is, it's different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20253\">CLIENT: Some biological entity with all of your information and memory is right there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20255\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20257\">CLIENT: And everyone will interact with that new person as if they were you. But you, your particular instance of consciousness, is extinguished.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20259\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025B\">CLIENT: And then... so that's... whatever happens then. The good news is, that Sam Harris puts out, there's no reason to fear death because being dead isn't going to hurt. It's like, oh, God, I'm afraid of death. Why? It's not going to be painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025F\">CLIENT: It would be nothing. So the only real immortality is to never die in the first place. And... but that's what people have... oh, I'll transfer my consciousness to a machine. How does that help you? You're still going to die. Yes, but this thing will live on. It doesn't matter. Nothing the hell <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2025F1\">matters to you once you're dead. [0:36:54] Either there's an afterlife and you're busy dealing with that, or there's nothing and that's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20261\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20263\">CLIENT: That's fine. That's absolutely fine, because, as Ginny's work has taught me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20265\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20267\">CLIENT: Numerous people see dead relatives in the weeks and months before they die, clear as day (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20269\">THERAPIST: [Is that right] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It often happens. And... to atheists, people who are like, why is this happening? Why do I see my husband? He is dead. I don't believe in anything. And so I have two explanations for this. One, there is an afterlife. And it's filled with people that you know, and they're waiting for you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2026B1\">to show up. And that sounds fantastic. The other is that there's nothing, and your brain tricks you. To ease your way into death, your brain tricks you. Either way is great news. Either way is excellent news. [0:37:54] So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it certainly seems to do that biologically. If you... people that are drowning, that have survived drowning... and everybody says it's very painful, but a lot of people were like, your body just takes over, and you get very relaxed. Anything, though, where the body responds to any kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2026D1\">of pain, and that there's... is there a psychological equivalent to that? I think that's where those phenomena of seeing white light and peace is just like what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026F\">CLIENT: Right<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20271\">THERAPIST: Is it...? I mean, no one can really say for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20273\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Is it real, or is it a trick? And either way, isn't that great?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20275\">THERAPIST: Mmm, yeah. Your body's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20277\">CLIENT: Either way isn't that great?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20279\">THERAPIST: Yeah, either way one thing or another, you're kind of taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B\">CLIENT: Right. Exactly. It's like, there is no more pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2027A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560013\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2027D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2027F\">CLIENT: Pain is over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20281\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

And that's of course the question that ran clockmaker, what's that one theory of the... but then... but even then... there's even more likely explanations for things like that, when you're like, oh, that's a really good mechanism. Some people are like, well, obviously God <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202831\">designed it that way, and the idea of design. What is actually I think a much more plausible... a significant... it sounds funny, but a significantly more plausible explanation than God created the universe and species and everything, is another alien race experimenting with (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20285\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20287\">CLIENT: That's totally plausible. I love the ancient alien theory. But there's nothing that's come out of it that's actually been... not been quickly rebuffed. [0:39:55] People are all like, oh, look at these amazing things, which certainly indicate that aliens were here...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20289\">THERAPIST: Oh, pyramids and... [0:40:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and (inaudible at 0:40:02). And people are like, well, no, I mean... (Pause) But the pyramids still have one thing we can't explain. (Pause) We don't know how to build that. We don't know how they did it. There's a lot of theories, but they're all able to be debunked. There's no... and <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2028B1\">really eventually what it becomes is, yeah, those are the pyramids. How did they come about? Nobody knows, because they don't seem to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028F\">CLIENT: We don't seem to need to understand how they work. They're not a danger to us as far as we can tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20291\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it also seems like it's connected to... I mean, those kind of discussions kind of get at something really significant about who brought us here, whether it's mother or a more genetic mother... [0:41:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20293\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20295\">THERAPIST: It's some way of... who is responsible for...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20297\">CLIENT: Who's responsible, and is it anyone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20299\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029B\">CLIENT: And the question, well, is the universe expanding into... great YouTube video on that, talking about the physics of that, of, what is the universe expanding into?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029F\">CLIENT: And a couple answers. One answer is... or it's possible that the answer is, there are no boundaries to the universe. It folds in such a way that we cannot understand that there are no boundaries, that there's some way that that happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A1\">THERAPIST: Beyond our level of comprehension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A3\">CLIENT: Of understanding, yeah, of dimensions and how they work, that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A7\">CLIENT: Because the one thing we do know is that, based on the fact that the universe is expanding, we are farther and farther away from any point at any moment. (Pause) [0:41:57] We will never reach the edge of the galaxy. It will always be further and further away. So if there's a boundary to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202A71\">universe we'll never get there, and we'll never be affected by it. It's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A9\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AB\">CLIENT: So we'll never be able to see it either. So... unless we figure out something (inaudible at 0:42:15).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AD\">THERAPIST: What's it expanding into?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AF\">CLIENT: What indeed? The idea... the theory that perhaps... this is the newest theory, which you know is...

Uh-huh. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Fascinating, fascinating. And the universe continues to accelerate. This is what we know. The universe accelerates even today. [0:42:55] Whatever began the push is still pushing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202B9\">THERAPIST: mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202BB\">CLIENT: That's amazing. What happens we can find that, when we can find the center? Well, we can't actually, can we? Just as we'll never find the edge, we can never find the center. We're further and further away from it every moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202BD\">THERAPIST: Yes, we're always off to the side (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So these are places we'll never be and never see. We'll (ph) be affected by them, except that something is pushing. Something is pushing, and something is pulling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202C1\">THERAPIST: What about that? What is that...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202C3\">CLIENT: That's amazing, dude. There's a push and pull to... gravity and then dark energy, one of them pushes, and the other pulls, pushes space apart, pulls mass together. And what is space but this fabric? What is space but this... (Pause) Two fish are swimming by, and an older fish swims by and says, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202C31\">how's the water? And he goes by. [0:43:58] And the two fish later are like, which one's water?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202C5\">THERAPIST: Which one's water?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, you've heard this, right? What is water? And... (Pause) Right. What's water? So actually that's a very good point, because all sorts of stuff we exist in all the time that we're probably not even aware of. This whole... the idea of the Higgs boson, a field that... a particle. If something's <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202C71\">made of particles then it\/ (ph) gives us mass, which we have no perception of. Mostly empty space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202C9\">THERAPIST: Mostly empty space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202CB\">CLIENT: Everything, mostly empty space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It's a trick (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202CF\">CLIENT: It's all a trick. So much of it's a trick. This is why people go crazy. [0:44:56] There's spooky stuff we don't understand. And it's... it makes sense to grasp it or explain why (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D1\">THERAPIST: Our minds are set up to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, and if you don't know the science they'll start pulling stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D7\">CLIENT: Sometimes this white bolt comes out of the sky and hits things and they catch on fire. What is that? It's got to be... there's someone up there throwing that shit down at us. Why? I don't know, he must be mad, dude. (Laughing) You see what he did? He must be pissed. We'd better do something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202D71\">Yeah, try burying that child under the foundation so it won't fall down. That's a good idea. I'm going to do that. Fucking ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well, but there's also an element of us that's always questioning that, or it has the potential to question.
