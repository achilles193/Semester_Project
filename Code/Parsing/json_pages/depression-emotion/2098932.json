(pause) Hi. So I'm back at work as of Monday, this past Monday, which is fine. It's just work. It's just getting ready for this semester. I feel a little bit bored. I'm still feeling bored and...I mean I'm looking forward to the opportunity to do the event (ph) in Brazil in May <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">instead of here and that will be a good change and everything but (pause) in terms of the day to day semester stuff, I'm really having a hard time being motivated and enthusiastic about it and I'm just trying to stay positive and whatever but it's just difficult because I was already kind of feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">that way. I like my job but it's just that I'm kind of bored and I don't know how to change that. I mean I'm sure I could be taking the time to (pause) learn other aspects of positions that I might want but I guess I just feel kind of like \"eh.\" If those positions aren't open then (pause) why bother? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">I don't know, something. Even if I do that I'm still not going to be not bored at my job. (pause) Or maybe it'll be even worse because I'll be like, \"Oh, then I could be doing all this other new stuff that I'm not doing and I'm learning about anything (ph) interesting,\" or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">And so I ended up having a...I talked to this girl Simone that I know through Franklin's (sp) friend. Anyway it's people in Newfoundland. It's Newfoundland friends that he has that are basically part of his crew but in Newfoundland. When we went for his birthday (pause) a couple years ago, a year <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">ago, whatever we went up for the weekend for his birthday to...that thing's recording right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It is, yeah I'm thinking I forgot to shut my...I was doing my interview...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Oh okay. Anyway, we met up with them and hung out with them while we were there, whatever. I liked the girl and they came and stayed with us a couple times when there were events going on, whatever. They were part of the crew that was there that weekend that I had to go to the baby shower when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">me and Franklin (sp) were going through all this stuff and they got in this fight and the whole thing. So I talked to her and she was like, \"Oh my God, I never told you but you know the real fight...\" The fight that they had, the real reason that they got in a fight was because Simone's boyfriend, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">the one that Franklin (sp) fought had and this is Simone telling me this because they had said something to Franklin (sp) something about, \"Why are you talking to another girl?\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" And they had told me it was because they were drunk and it was five in the morning and he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">just talking trash for no reason. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So then she told me this long story dating back to the week that I was in Virginia with my mom after I had just found out about this whole thing and was trying to figure out what to do and he went to...I sent him...I bought him some tickets so he could go to Newfoundland because he really wanted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">be with his friends and do something and I was like, \"Cool. Go. God Bless, whatever.\" And we were trying to work on stuff, right? And there had been this girl that I had noticed he had liked some pictures a while back or like I had seen pop up on his Facebook messaging when he was with me or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">like that. And I was like, \"Who's this random girl?\" and I looked at her page. He's like, \"Oh she's a photographer...she does photography,\" or modeling, something. It always was like because he was making his networking. He was always networking. That was always why he was contacting these people because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">it's all networking for his fucking...anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098932\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">So (pause) I guess...so he had been sketchy that weekend. (pause) He said that Caleb's friend was coming to pick him up at the bus station and I was like, \"Okay,\" and there had been a 12 hour period where he didn't...I think I told you where he didn't pick up his phone or call me back or anything and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">I was like, \"What the hell?\" So apparently he met up with this girl, the same girl that I had asked him about that she was from Newfoundland or whatever, and he went over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What's her first name? Just as a way to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don't even know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Okay, alright. Never mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: French girl, French girl. Whatever. (pause) And so then I was like, \"Oh, well maybe it is Caleb's friend and that's how he met her or whatever,\" but then Simone telling me no, she said basically, \"Yeah we thought it was weird because Caleb was going to go pick him up but then he's like, \u2018No, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">this girl is coming to pick me up.'\" (pause) And they were like, \"What?\" And so obviously it's not a friend of his. And he made these plans separately on his own with her. And I mean Simone was like, \"No he wasn't away from us for more than 30 minutes so they didn't sleep together or whatever,\" but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">I guess they wanted to go to the beach the second day that he was there. Franklin (sp) was wanting to go to the beach and then Simone was like (pause), \"Oh, no I'm tired. It's too late or something like that and then Franklin (sp) was like, \"Fine.\" He was pushing and pushing and then finally he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">like, \"Well I told this girl that we were going to meet at the beach.\" And Simone was like, \"Ok well, I guess we're going to the beach then.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">And first of all she's like, \"Oh she was so ugly and looked like a whale,\" whatever. Good time. And she's like, \"Then we were laying there and it was so awkward. They literally couldn't even hold a conversation and a language barrier and I was like lying between them and it was really awkward. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">we were just laying, sunbathing and they went in the water for a little while. I didn't because it was too cold and they were like...but you could tell it was really awkward.\" Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">So I guess fast forward to the fight at my house, I guess Franklin (sp) had maybe said something to Caleb jokingly or talking trash a little, or whatever, because they were all drunk and whatever. And I noticed Caleb was like, \"Oh yeah? You're going to say that to me when you're going to Newfoundland <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">and fuck with some other girl behind Trina's back?\" to Franklin (sp).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay, so Franklin (sp) said something to Caleb?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: He must have...whatever. Yeah that's when the fight (overlapping voices) or whatever that Caleb was angry and drunk so came out with, \"Yeah, you're going to sit here and talk trash to me and you're fucking some other girl in Newfoundland while Trina's at home?\" or whatever. And that's what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">thought. And Franklin (sp) got all red in the face and was like all angry and looked at Simone and was like, \"Simone did anything happen with her?\" And Simone's like, \"Um, no, but he's still right. (chuckle) You still went to another country and didn't tell your girlfriend that you met up with some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">random girl that you randomly met on Facebook.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098932\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">So I found that out the other day and it made me angry but then I was kind of like, \"Eh.\" It just really solidifies the fact that I really don't give a shit. Anything that I did wrong in the relationship or whatever, he just lied so much to me, our whole fucking relationship. It's just disgusting and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">I don't understand how he could ever have gotten...how he could ever have had any ammunition to say that anything is my fault. I don't know. It just kind of made me feel justified all over again but also (pause) angry because like what else? God! (pause) It's just so...I can't understand why he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B2\">always keeping his options...and literally he did this after I found out about Betty already and confronted him about Betty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Right, this is just in the wake of that right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Literally like three or four days probably (pause) or something, whatever. And then he goes to Newfoundland and slept with somebody that...and lied to me? I just don't...it's like a sickness. He's sick and I really don't want to be associated with him anymore and it's annoying because some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">his mailings are still getting sent to the house and I'm waiting for that to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">I don't know, I think I'm just...in the meantime I'm happy...I was really (inaudible) about my vacation. It was really good. I like really have stress all the time so I need to start doing something to reduce stress because I just think I carry a lot of tension around with me all the time. Did I tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">you that I went...maybe I didn't see you. My mom and I went to go get massages...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: You told me you were going to. Maybe you were going soon after...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: That weekend, yeah. Well we went and it was really nice. We had a gift certificate. It was very nice. Connie [had a great] (ph) anniversary, really nice place, and it was supposed to be a 60 minute full body massage, whatever. Just like a massage. And the woman literally started and was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">\"I'm going to do the whole time on your back because you are so tight and have so many knots.\" And it literally...I could feel her pushing my knots out and she wasn't even done. She had to finish because the 60 minutes were done but I could even tell that she wasn't done. I could still feel her moving <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">stuff around. And like two days later my back was hurting again. (pause) So I am going to go back for another massage next week (pause) because it did really help. It just like...I think I just have so much still built up or whatever but I need to start figuring out...I think I'm going to try to start <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200373\">going to yoga. There's a beginner's yoga class at 8:30 on Saturday mornings at the yoga studio literally behind my house, like it's in a community behind my house, like a building or whatever. So I think I'm going to start with that. The thing about it is yoga is supposed to be relaxing but I get so <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200374\">in my brain about doing the moves right and I can't, I'm not flexible enough and whatever that it ends up being stressful and frustrating. So I need to try and see if I can work through that or maybe I need to find a different kind of yoga or something. I don't know...a different kind of...I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098932\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">But I just know that I'm like tempo (ph). Even though the vacation was nice and I got a lot of stuff done in my house. I kind of redid my bedroom a little bit and redid my living room a little bit which feels good. It feels refreshed and it does make me feel not as antsy in terms of my apartment situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">which I was feeling a little bit before. (pause) But I think that in general I'm just feeling kind of antsy. I think it's...I don't know. I started to feel (pause) kind of stressed out about having never (pause) fulfilled my goal of living outside of the state or yet and craving being somewhere else <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">but not really sure how I would do it. I'm just conflicted I guess because (pause) I like my job at the university and I like being at the university and I like being near my family and friends and whatever. (pause) But at the same time I've never experienced anything different and so...and I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200393\">know if I'll have a chance to (pause) or what. I don't know. I don't know what to do. I think being bored at my job is a big part of it (pause) so it's kind of making me think, \"Well why don't I just move?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">(silence from 00:11:36 to 00:11:48)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Well I'm a little confused at the moment because (pause) being kind of bored at work, (pause) having gotten this sort of in a way additional bad news but also in a way additional confirmatory news and that Franklin (sp)...I don't know. I hear what you're saying that it didn't bother you that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">much but I would imagine it still kinda sucks at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: And (pause) I sort of feel like what am I missing? That in itself bored at work, more bad news about Franklin (sp) doesn't quite add up in a way to having so many knots in your back that the masseuse needs to spend an hour working and then they're back within a few days anyway, or wanting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">to pick up and move someplace you've never lived before. I mean, those (pause)...there's sort of a degree of tension or sort of (pause) a [feeling of being kind of ill at ease] (ph) there that the other stuff doesn't quite seem to add up to it as far as I can... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: You mean like why I would I seem that tense just for those things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah why are you feeling that tense? Or that wound up or feeling so antsy that you just want to get out of town and live somewhere else, like have a whole other life somewhere else. Those seem like reactions to pretty profound...I guess that's what I'm saying. Those seem like reactions to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">pretty profound stress or anxiety or something and yet it's not (pause)...[I'm actually trying to] (ph) figure it out but it's not clear to me yet what that's from and it doesn't seem like being bored with your job (pause) or that Franklin (sp) would kind of account for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: I mean it could also be that my birthday's coming up (pause) and I'm just getting older and I'm feeling another year older and another year that I haven't done x things that I wanted to get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: I see. So are you kind of upset about where your life is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: I mean a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098932\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I mean, not in your head. I can imagine that rationally like, \"Okay, I'm getting bored with my job [but it's also a] (ph) good job and yes I'm not involved with anybody but yes I just ended this long relationship. I don't really...\" In some parts it sounds like you're really back out there <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">anyway. So at one level in your head I could imagine you saying like, \"Things are going to be fine. I'm not where I want to be but there's sort of... (inaudible) where I am.\" But maybe on another level it feels very different from that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">CLIENT: I think that must be what it is. And maybe it's the stress of (pause) pushing down whatever those other feelings are kind of just relying on the, \"It's just temporary. I'll feel better. Everything's fine.\" Whatever. Maybe it's the stress of trying to make that okay that's making me super wound <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">up. It could be I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yep. (pause) So I would imagine you (pause) would ideally like to be engaged or married and you're thinking about (pause) having a baby. (pause) And I'm not quite sure what on the work front. I don't know if that would sort of take a back seat to the family stuff or do you have other things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">that you really want to be doing there too that you're not doing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: I think that work is just more about wanting some change like in environment.

So I think that that's starting to get to me a little bit because I'm not used to it or I haven't experienced it really in so long. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">then (pause) yeah I think that the feelings of wanting to be starting whatever my life's going to be like for the rest of my life is what's creating this desire to move because maybe it's like, \"Well at least if I'm moving then I have to start a new phase of my life even if it's just me,\" as opposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200572\">to just me here continuing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">THERAPIST: What's the matter with you here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">CLIENT: I'm bored.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And by yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah and cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: You seem on the verge of getting upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: I feel that way but I don't to want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: What's upsetting you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: (pause) Just (pause)...I wanted to move a long time ago (crying) and I didn't and I just... (pause) this whole fucking relationship with Franklin (sp). Like I could have moved three years ago instead of starting a relationship with him. (pause) And now it's like three years later and I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">work for my old job anymore so that opportunity isn't really there as readily. I feel like I just sacrificed that to try to be in this relationship and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: And that didn't work out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: And it didn't work out.

He lied to me in the beginning and I knew he was lying to me and it's just (pause) frustrating that I was okay with that and fine, okay we changed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">and whatever for three years and I just literally kept holding on to the fucking relationship.

At least <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">if he was calling you a bitch in your fights he was telling his truth.

I used that theory three years ago. Look where it got me. And then other people are like, \"Well you don't want to be that desperate girl that...because guys know when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F1\">you're husband hungry.\" And I'm like okay, I don't really...whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) Because that's reassuring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: I'm not saying you're so husband hungry but how...is that supposed to make you feel better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: I know.

(pause) And that's why honestly at home I am happier because I don't know, like having a refreshed space just...it does feel really good. It feels like it's not the same thing that I've been living in for the last three years.

Like I'm still feeding the fucking cats and I'm still climbing three sets of stairs, and I'm still driving the same car, going into the same place every day, doing the same things every day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Some of the way it works is that everything should be different in a way.

(pause) And Steph can't really...she doesn't understand these feelings that I have because (pause) I mean she was living with this boyfriend more or less but then he also moved and they weren't together for a while. They had periods of separation and she wasn't together with him for as <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">long and (pause) it's just a very different experience to...and she didn't build an apartment with him that they lived in together and the past. So it's really hard for her to understand (pause) I want to leave my job. I want to move. I want to be in a different state. I want to have a new car. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A12\">she can't...it's like, \"Why so extreme? You should just be happy that you have everything and you're great and blah blah blah. You have to worry already about not being sad so don't let that stuff add to it.\" But that is the stuff making me sad so she doesn't really get it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">The other day I got really annoyed at my friend because he was like, \"Well you never know.

Sometimes you get back together and then you maybe break up again or maybe not or maybe in the future.

Like it's not ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A53\">going to happen. If we can help it we won't ever see each other in person again. It will never happen, unless it's by chance in the grocery store, like it's just not happening. And I felt (pause) defensive because I felt like it was somebody telling me, \"Well no you'll just...you'll probably...it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A54\">fine. It's fine.\" (pause) I'm like, \"No it's not.\" (pause) Why would I do that, you know? \"Don't start looking around yet for other people because you know, you might get back together with him so just take it easy for now.
