I had a good day yesterday. It was feeling like Spring. Maybe one day it\u2019s feeling like Spring, but \u2013 you know \u2013 good enough. [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:52) so I took the kids out to the playground.  (pause) And I started packing. (pause) Part of me thinks that moving could be really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">good. I don\u2019t know. (long pause)  Back to waiting and seeing. (pause) I don\u2019t know enough what the options are. (long pause)  It occurred to me this morning that even if I had stayed at Brown and James hadn\u2019t moved us here, we would still be in this position at this point where I really didn\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">to do a post doc, so I guess it\u2019s a little bit reassuring.  It would still be tougher now. (laughs) We are supposed to go to this party with most of James\u2019s friends from grad school who are in the Denver area this weekend. Our car is still not running, so I don\u2019t know. I think there is a commuter rail <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">we can take, but it\u2019s like an hour\u2019s drive away by commuter rail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s out in . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Out west. It\u2019s way out west on 2. I don\u2019t know. (pause)  I don\u2019t know. But I did find out that Monica only wants me to come in for a couple, three hours on Friday, if that, so that would be nice. (laughs) (long pause) I have a tough time with the people from James\u2019s grad school grad program. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\"> It\u2019s just always sort of stressful. I like them; they\u2019re fine; they\u2019re just really different from me. Then I think well, they\u2019re also really different from James. I don\u2019t know. I think that was one of the things that was tough for James in Ohio. He had trouble finding people to talk to, which is why <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">it was so great when his friend from undergrad, Cody, and his wife, Kerry, were there because Cody is a poet. (laughs) He could talk to him. Cody is sort of crazy in some ways.  I can never tell whether he believes the ideas he is putting out there or whether it\u2019s more that he thinks the world would <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">be more fun if it were true, and so he\u2019s just sort of hoping that they\u2019re true. I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I have a much easier time finding friends than James does and I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s because I am \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 better at finding people or less picky about the people that I want to be friends with or whether it\u2019s because I\u2019m just positioned right in a way that James is not.  (pause) I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">know if the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in chemistry are all that different from the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in theology. It\u2019s not a difference both groups seem to want. (laughs) I don\u2019t know. (pause)  If we did move, this would be the first time that I moved <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">to a new city where I didn\u2019t know anybody or didn\u2019t know more than a couple of people and wasn\u2019t already in some sort of graduate program or a workplace or something to anchor me. (pause) It doesn\u2019t make me anxious, but I feel like maybe it ought to. I think that that could go really badly, but I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">get worried about that. I don\u2019t know. (pause)  Even with knowing so many people, it hasn\u2019t really kept me from being really lonely here. (pause) It\u2019s this weird thing. One day I\u2019ll be talking to James about it or thinking about it and be like, \u201cYeah. Yeah, let\u2019s go somewhere else. Let\u2019s find a new place <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">and see what the options are.\u201d There is almost nowhere else in the country where my skills would be less valuable than they are here in terms of there just being a critical mass of people with a Humanities degree here. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562474\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: There are a lot of people who are Brown-educated in some obscure discipline here, just a lot of them. And it\u2019s really fun, but it also means that finding a job is that much harder; and that\u2019s not going to be the case in other places. (pause) I feel like there is almost no situation that would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">not be better for James than what we\u2019re in now. It makes a huge difference in my life when he\u2019s doing well, when I\u2019m not the only person that he has to talk to about interesting things like this is for us.  (pause) Some days I think that and then other days, it\u2019s just like terror. Yesterday was sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">of the latter and today is sort of the former and I don\u2019t know. (long pause) Obviously, you come into that, but it\u2019s not clear to me how. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: One thing that occurs to me is you are feeling relatively well, good I guess \u2013 like yesterday, the other day and today \u2013 and it\u2019s like you don\u2019t need me in the same way if you\u2019re feeling good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause)  It\u2019s hard to make decisions across emotional states. I always wonder whether everyone is like this, like the whole landscape changes on your having a bad day or when you\u2019re having a good day. I imagine, if I think about it, most things are a spectrum and blah, blah, blah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">(laughs)  I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s a little more for you, not then for everybody, but more than for most people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Thanks. Yeah. It\u2019s certainly not the case for James and it\u2019s certainly like every once in a while, we\u2019ll have an explicit conversation about it where I\u2019ll say, \u201cJames, this is how I work. When I\u2019m having a good day it looks really different than when I\u2019m having a bad day. I can\u2019t see anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">outside of my emotions [in some ways.] (ph?)\u201d I think it makes things very confusing for him.  It makes things very confusing for me also at times. (laughs) Oh, well. I feel like if I can tell something and get other people to help remind me of that, maybe it won\u2019t matter so much that I can\u2019t remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">it myself. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I guess part of it is that it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s different, I think, but that less now, but still to some extent, without realizing it, you lose touch with what it\u2019s really like the other way. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like the extent to which I\u2019ve sort of changed that has been more like remembering that I lose touch than actually not losing touch; and that\u2019s even not that great. (laughs) (pause) So it\u2019s like in the last couple to three weeks even, I\u2019ll be like in this awful place, just totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">miserable and desperate and kind of crazy-making and then I go to do something, usually it was something for church, and act like I\u2019m okay and after about a half hour somebody will ask \u201chow are you doing?\u201d and I\u2019ll be like \u201coh, I\u2019m great.\u201d And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m lying. I believe it, but it\u2019s just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">at that moment, I\u2019m only thinking about the part of my life that is right here, right now, which is that I\u2019m having an interesting conversation or I\u2019m doing okay. Sometimes I feel like it helps me survive, like it helps me get through those really bad times.  It\u2019s weird. (pause) I feel like it\u2019s impossible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">for me to be honest, in some ways. If I say \u201cactually, I\u2019m not doing so well,\u201d that is true with regards to the macro state, but it doesn\u2019t actually reflect what\u2019s going on in that moment. If I say \u201cI\u2019m doing great\u201d then that reflects what\u2019s going on in the moment, but it\u2019s a very small moment compared <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">to what\u2019s really happening. (pause) [I wonder when] (ph?) people stop believing what I say.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562474\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">There was this pretty [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:55) Facebook conversation last night about deaf children and cochlear implants, a bad choice and all of that. I don\u2019t know if it was talking like people clearly didn\u2019t know very many deaf people or weren\u2019t in touch with that community because it was very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">why ever would you not give your child a chance to hear? That is an incredibly cruel and terrible choice. Yes, language is culture and that would be bad if that were lost, but no, really, it\u2019s more important to be hearing. I don\u2019t know what I think about that, but it\u2019s not really important. Joanne is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">a [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:42) interpreter and she\u2019s really involved with the deaf community and used to teach primary school kids who were deaf, so she\u2019s pretty anti-cochlear implants and pretty firmly an advocate for the deaf community.  I was sort of seeing both sides of it and I guess I was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200273\">thinking about how you don\u2019t see what is outside your experience. People say \u201cwhy do parents choose not to give their children a chance of having a whole other sense?\u201d Well, they don\u2019t have it and they like their life and they don\u2019t know, in some instances they can\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing and, also, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200274\">people who have that extra sense can\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing by having it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: I follow. Like the people in the conversation yesterday on Facebook are sort of making these comments and judgments very much within their own world view without necessarily realizing how much they are in their own world view. There is kind of another side. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And since it\u2019s about perception, it\u2019s sort of a nice link to the conversation to be having. I was reading a poem called, Monet Refuses the Operation. It was about the painter describing, \u201cIt took me 55 years to learn how to see like this and now you want to fix my eyes?\u201d It was a nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">poem. (pause) I guess I was just thinking how it was relatively recent that it occurred to me that other people might not work like this, like be so controlled by their emotional states, like have their landscape be so dependent on emotions.  Maybe everyone else is like that, just in different ways. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B2\">I don\u2019t know. I just feel like people who say their judgments are wholly dependent on their emotional state are mostly full of bullshit. (both laugh) my favorite Old Testament scholar gave a lecture on Saturday and the line I really liked was, \u201cUp until about the mid-20th century, scholarship was all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B3\">about objectivity and that was the gold standard of objectivity. And then we eventually just realized that objectivity was just white male experience.\u201d (both laugh)  That was nice. (long pause) You would think that I was going somewhere but . . . (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562474\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">I know this is how Amanda works, so that also makes it hard. She has much more polarity than I do, in some ways. (long pause) So I feel like sometimes I talk to her from time to time and it will be like she just has this completely different idea of what her life looks like in one conversation than <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D1\">a week later. That I get, but I feel like sometimes we\u2019re just really far separated and so, when we try to talk, I just don\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying at all.  Sometimes we\u2019re really there together and sometimes we just can\u2019t even talk. (long pause) Part of me wants to be like \u201cis there a diagnosis for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D2\">that?\u201d and part of me is like \u201cI don\u2019t think it really matters that much.\u201d I don\u2019t know which of those I actually want to claim as my opinion. (laughs)  I feel like I know which of those you would fall on, but . . . (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You mean . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: Your approach tends to be like I don\u2019t think that matters all that much. (laughs) (pause) It\u2019s funny talking with people in the hospital. People get very attached to their diagnoses. I think I only notice that because I don\u2019t have one in the same way. (pause)  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really expecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">you to weigh in on this much. I feel like sometimes when I talk about stuff, I really want you to say something about it or speak from experience, but I don\u2019t really feel like that\u2019s the case right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it is true because I do think there are times that it can be helpful to have one formal given diagnosis or informally something about, depending on what the dynamics are, having the sense of part of what you\u2019re [finding with me] (ph?) is that there are ways that people sort of hide <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200331\">behind that or use it to move away from what their experience actually is.  In other words, what I mean is depression is not very descriptive compared to something like paranoid schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder. Those things seem more descriptive than things like depression or generalized anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: I think that depression is about as useful a description as fever, in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yes, whereas I do think that something like paranoid schizophrenia or [ ] (inaudible at 00:34:27) disorder are a little more useful, I think. It doesn\u2019t say a lot about who the person is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: The one that I have seen in talking to people who have a bi-polar diagnosis, it is clear that that is a really useful thing for them to know about themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Absolutely; particularly a bi-polar one that looks pretty biological in the sense that, for some people, bi-polar is affected a lot by what is going on in their environment. For other people, it just isn\u2019t and for those people it\u2019s really good to know. (both laugh)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: I was just thinking about Amanda. I feel like from where I sit, it looks to me a lot like she is bi-polar, too, and she does not succumb to it. She doesn\u2019t want to be involved in mental health care, basically. She doesn\u2019t want to take meds and \u2013 okay. I don\u2019t know. I wonder how her life would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">be different if she were not making that choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562474\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Like if she were getting treated and thinking more of herself in those terms, stuff like that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t know if it would be better. It would be different. I think it might be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: [Might not.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: She\u2019s had some really bad therapists. (chuckles) So did I so . . . (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: Another thing: it seems to be where we\u2019re at with some of this. In a way, I\u2019m quite sure what to make of or what to do with how to think about when you\u2019re feeling more this way, the way you are today, well.  Not in my mind because it\u2019s feeling better, per se, but I guess for reasons that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">at least to me so far, are not entirely clear \u2013 maybe because you\u2019re feeling kind of strong, I think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Like I don\u2019t swing violently in this direction, so much as I just saunter over there? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re this way, at least to me, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re kind of as possessed by the things that you feel or, perhaps, you [don\u2019t know] (ph?) what those things are. You\u2019re talking about how it might be really nice to move, but I\u2019m not really sure why.  It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">you, but I don\u2019t know what you really have in mind about the changes. I guess you mentioned that it might be easier to get a job, but I don\u2019t expect that\u2019s all of what you meant. You said it would be better for James, although again I\u2019m not sure why and I can certainly see how, if it would be better <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">for him, it would also be better for you. It seems somehow it\u2019s a little less clear to me so far. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: In some ways, I feel like when I\u2019m doing well it\u2019s very common for me to want to be doing something else, to be like I want to explore. I want to go someplace else and see what else is out there.  (pause) I also think it would be nice to be closer to family, like it would be nice to be back <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">in San Antonio. It\u2019s like I can remember other times when I was happy and the physical location of those times, so I guess that\u2019s less exploring and more like I want to go back there. (chuckles) I can\u2019t remember what it was like to live in San Antonio when I\u2019m depressed because I remember that as being <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">really happy, so it doesn\u2019t [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:53). (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">I feel like it\u2019s less important for me to tell you about it when I\u2019m doing better, like when I\u2019m sad or desperate I describe it constantly inside my head. [If I\u2019m really down, I\u2019ll often try to think how I would tell somebody about it.] (ph?) What would I say? [I feel less urgent.] (ph?) (pause) [ ] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">(inaudible at 00:41:23) (chuckles) which is a little depressing in itself. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: Are you thinking that it seems a little less self-reflective or more bland or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: I just think it\u2019s a little depressing that what I feel is so urgent for me to put out in the world is all the worst stuff that happens that is inside of me. (laughs)  The good things seem less important to spread around and \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t really think I\u2019m comfortable with that idea. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">I guess I also feel like everyone would understand what it feels like to be doing pretty well and enjoying my job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">THERAPIST: To me it seems like you don\u2019t need as much help bearing those things \u2013 or maybe any \u2013 by contrast. I guess I can also see in a way how you are feeling like being well, if I\u2019m thinking about how to tell people about this, it\u2019s because I want to spread it out into the world or put these bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">things out there into the world.
