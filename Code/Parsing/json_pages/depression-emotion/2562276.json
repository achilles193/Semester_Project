This (morning) (ph) it doesn\u2019t actually seem like it\u2019s been [that long to me] (ph). Yeah, yeah. I feel like April is when it starts to get old. (pause)  So I was thinking on the way over here, the nice thing about not being in the hospital, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t just talk to so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">many people. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">But actually like I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s this thing of like, I really like talking to people; I really can\u2019t resist it; I can\u2019t (pause) also I like not having to talk to you know a different person twice a day about my feelings, who\u2019ll then try to fix them based on knowing nothing about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I feel people who with less training are better at not trying to fix things in general; [typical guy] (ph) (chuckle)  (pause) It\u2019s funny like (pause) so they\u2019ve, you know, nurses who are like various ages, and they\u2019ve got various people coming in like expressive therapists; stuff like that; like specialists. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">But most people are just like MHS; mental hall staff; mental specialists or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So as far as I can tell, basically people with like an undergraduate psych degree, (pause) it just seems so young, and I feel like most of them are about my age, but to sort of like weird thing where it\u2019s like I am actually asking them for help, and advice and comfort. And, you know, actually using <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">what they do in a real way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And at the same time, part of me sort of wants to be like, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t do that, you should do it this way.\u201d  (laughter) (pause) I don\u2019t know. (pause) And I call them kiddo in the ER; (laughter) my like a physician\u2019s assistant who was like maybe my age; maybe younger, but (laughter) there\u2019s no <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">way he was older than 30.

Like I don\u2019t know. (pause) About yesterday morning; like my last morning, I was sitting waiting to leave, and I was sitting next to a woman who\u2019s waiting to go down to ECT. And we were sort of hanging out with another woman who\u2019s her roommate. A man comes in who\u2019s running the bridge <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">to campus; like college group. And he\u2019s like, \u201cYou three look like you go to college.\u201d (chuckle) We\u2019re all like, \u201cNope.\u201d (laughter) The woman with the ECT was like, \u201cI\u2019m 34.\u201d (laughter) He was like, \u201cNone of you?\u201d We\u2019re like, \u201cKeep moving.\u201d  (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I don\u2019t know.

(pause) You know, I do feel younger, but then at the same time, there\u2019s always a part of my brain that\u2019s sort of standing back and evaluating. And that often feels much older. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I did actually like (pause) I want to say rebuke, but I don\u2019t know if that \u2013 that would be too strong. But I talked to one guy who\u2019s probably about my age, maybe a little bit younger, who just like could not fucking keep his mouth shut. He really likes giving advice, and like pontificating; he was definitely <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">like a pontificate; he had one of those little like agwardian style mustaches, (laughter) and wore a pocket watch, and it was in a flannel shirt; I kid you not. And like, I have a lot of love in my heart for those people. (laughter) And also for pontificators; like I sort of have to embarrassingly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">in my friends that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562276\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">But I was talking with another patient just like about history, and I sort of was saying that \u201cI\u2019m not on any psych meds, because I went through like 15 of them, and they didn\u2019t really work. So my psychiatrist decided like hey you could do better without them.\u201d And he sort of jumped in, and was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">\u201cI overheard you saying, have you thought that like \u2013 I just wanted to make sure, have you thought that sometimes meds take a long time to work.\u201d  (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, and he was like, \u201cSometimes it\u2019s like a couple of months.\u201d And in the moment, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m a year ahead of you dude.\u201d (laughter) \u201cTrust me when I say nope.\u201d And so I was like that was fine, then I went away. Then the next day, I was like, \u201cYou know when you said that? That was super <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">patronizing. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d He apologized, and he said, \u201cOh I didn\u2019t hear the part where you, you know, had tried the inaudible at 00:07:50), I just heard that you were trying them and had given up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">But in my head I was like, \u201cWell if you didn\u2019t hear the whole conversation, then really you shouldn\u2019t have said something.\u201d But I felt like I done the part that I needed to do for my healing, and his inability to (pause) like whatever.

It felt like he sort of (pause) you know, he was talking to me early on in like the first couple of days, and found out that I was in the PT program and married to a chemist. And it felt like he was like you\u2019re the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Talking about what program?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: That I was in the PT program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: That I have this like intellectual background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m not \u2013 (sigh) this might be reading too much into it, but it sort of felt like he was like, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the smartest patient here. I\u2019m going to make her convinced that I\u2019m smarter than she is.\u201d Because they\u2019ve sort of had a lot of \u2013 he\u2019d be like, \u201cMy dad\u2019s an astrophysicist.\u201d And we\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">talk about physicists when we\u2019re talking about scientists. He\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, this is what research is like, you know, you sometimes work \u2018til two and three in the morning.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, you know, it really bothered James when his advisor told him he had leave at midnight with everybody else.\u201d Like, (chuckle) \u201cWhat are you trying to do here? You\u2019re not educating me. (chuckle) It\u2019s not your job to like \u2013 it\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I don\u2019t know whether that is actually \u2013 whether that\u2019s an accurate read, but sort of the like sense I was getting. (pause) (overlapping voices)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: He also did a shitty job taking care of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah; yeah. I never was like \u2013 he was never assigned to be like my one-on-one contact person, which is a good job \u2013 a good thing. He mentioned a couple of times about how he\u2019d like to give homework during check-ins. (chuckle) And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d  (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562276\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">I don\u2019t know. (pause) (sigh) It sort of just like push and pull between really just wanting people to take care of me, but also like wanting to take care of other people. Both in terms of like taking care of the other patients, and supporting them, and in terms of helping people that suck at their jobs. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">(pause) I feel like I catch the latter, but that, you know, a level that was internal rather than external (chuckle) for most of the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">But I don\u2019t know. (pause) I found that (pause) (sigh) like I had very strong positive or negative reactions to staff people often like depending on who they reminded me of. So there was like one MHS who actually just reminded me a lot of Theo in terms of like \u2013 in sort of physical presence. He was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">very tall, and sort of not really good at being very tall. (pause) Then he just \u2013 I found him very very comforting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Then there was a lady who reminded me a lot of my mom. (laughter) And I sort of (inaudible at 00:12:29) her. Then there\u2019s like \u2013 it felt like \u2013 so she remembered me from a year ago, and expected me to remember her clearly, and I didn\u2019t. She sort of seemed pretty hurt when I had to ask for her name twice. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">You know, like she kind of gave me a hard time for not coming to her group. And I was like, \u201cReally? Oh.\u201d She was like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to my group?\u201d I was like, \u201cProbably either I was napping or I had visitors.\u201d That\u2019s what I did say. She\u2019s like, \u201cWell I\u2019ll see you tomorrow at the next one.\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">was like, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">It sort of felt \u2013 it felt like she had a lot of herself wrapped up in whether she could help me or not. And that wasn\u2019t something that I would\u2019ve felt good about. (pause) Like I (sigh) sort of freaked out. (chuckle) (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">I don\u2019t know. (pause) I missed you. (pause) Okay, I\u2019m just going to say that for a second. Call me something. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: All right. (pause) I expect you did it like heard what you\u2019re saying is that they weren\u2019t me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: And (pause) among other things, you were kind of annoyed at them for that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Basically. (laughter) (pause) Yeah. (pause) That makes me very uncomfortable, like (pause) it just doesn\u2019t seem to be a safe position to be in.  (pause) I talked with James yesterday about (pause) needing him not to try to manage my care. (pause) And it was a very scary and intense conversation, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">but it sort of ended up in a good place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Oh.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: He is I think, taking my ending up in the hospital as a reason that I cannot be trusting, which we\u2019re going to have to talk about. (pause) Yeah. (pause) But that\u2019s not a conversation that I want \u2013 like that\u2019s a conversation we\u2019ll have to wait until (inaudible at 00:18:34).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) I was just thinking about (pause) in terms of trust, like there\u2019s one time in the hospital that I did like self-injure, or I just like scratched my arm up. (pause) And, you know, I told somebody about it. Like in a sort of time that I was supposed to check-in with somebody.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562276\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">Which led to sort of a very interesting dynamic that like the person I was talking to was \u2013 he was probably in his like 50s or 60s, and he sort of really knew what he was doing. But he started out by (pause) (sigh) basically he started out some assumptions that were wrong. And I would try to like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">correct an assumption, and then be like, (inaudible at 00:20:12) I\u2019m just going to not talk anymore and we can be done. It\u2019s fine if he thinks wrong things about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">And he\u2019d be like, \u201cYour demeanor changed. Like what (inaudible at 00:20:21)?\u201d And so I\u2019d be like, \u201cOkay this is what\u2019s going on.\u201d I guess what I was thinking about is just that like he (pause) (sigh) he didn\u2019t get it exactly right, but like he sort of saw where he was going wrong and made an effort to shift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">It turned out like that\u2019s not that common. (laughter) So that was nice to see. Yeah I guess the sort of common thing there is that (pause) it\u2019s so \u2013 it\u2019s so hard for me to have the conversations where I say like, \u201cNo, you were thinking about this wrong.\u201d Or, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand this.\u201d Or, \u201cYou\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">doing this wrong.\u201d And sort of stick with the conversation long enough to get some change made or like have something they could change.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: It feels like \u2013 well it sort of depends, and with James it\u2019s like always worth it to \u2013 it\u2019s harder to be with James and not have something correct, like not have the correction be made, because I have to still be around him. And so then there\u2019s just like this terror that I won\u2019t be able to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">him understand that like \u2013 or he\u2019ll just be \u2013 or it\u2019ll just like be fractured always.

(pause) But I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. I guess it feels like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">lot of time the assumptions are more important to them than what\u2019s actually going on, and I don\u2019t. (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">It just feels hopeless to try to get through that. (pause) (sigh)  (pause) I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m explaining that right. (pause) Like talking about you, it made me think about James, made me think that that\u2019s just how they react. I don\u2019t if I\u2019m like actually saying the \u2013 I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">saying about that conversation is actually the thing that I was thinking of or the thing that was important to me.

(pause) He started conversations where he (pause) at least sort of part of the thoughtss of what you\u2019re saying I think, was that you felt more trusting of (inaudible at 00:29:33).

(pause) Maybe \u2013 (pause) you know, I (pause) I was sitting there talking to some about like sort of wanting to like ask for support from <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">like Patrick, but for some (inaudible at 00:30:52) not feeling like I could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">So he came in and saw me last [of all] (ph), and he sort of [sent an e-note] (ph) that was like completely after I get out of the hospital, I want to talk with you about it \u2013 and like I want to talk to you about it, like not feeling like I could come to you for support and why that was.

(pause) I was talking with (inaudible at 00:31:50) and like, I think I characterize her as nosey, but like she is, but I really don\u2019t mind it actually like most of the time.
