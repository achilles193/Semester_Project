data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: He had said that a balance that I \u2013 I have new (inaudible at 0:00:03) that\u2019s incorrect, but it turns out it was more like, my bill crossed your check kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So, yeah (inaudible at 0:00:19). (pause) Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not doing so well; continuing to not do well. Pretty crappy too. (pause) I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m supposed to go tutor after this. I guess I\u2019ll see how it goes. (pause) All the time that I had sort of blocked out this weekend for \u2013 for caring for tutoring and also preparing, researching for this talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">during the week. Pretty much most of it, but like staring blankly at. (chuckle) [0:01:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of that. (pause) I feel like I have some creep disease, but like it doesn\u2019t look like it. And that\u2019s something like every five or ten minutes, I have to sort of decide not to kill myself. That takes a lot of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [0:02:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I become mad and (pause) I feel like I\u2019m less concerned about how other people are going to feel about the things that say than I usually am, which in itself is probably a good thing. But nobody seems to mind. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: But I can see, in addition to that how, it reflects you\u2019re not doing well, partly because of \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re saying -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That you feel more abandoned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:03:54] You meant abandon, not abandoned, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay, that\u2019s what I thought. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Maybe you feel more abandoned too, but that\u2019s not what I had in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s not \u2013 yeah. (pause) [0:05:02] (pause) I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m (pause) I\u2019m afraid of dying, but I think I\u2019m more afraid of just continuing to be like this. (pause) You know, just sort of frantically racing through my options, and if I do this, then this will happen, and if I do this, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">this will happen, and these are the things that might happen; these are the things that probably won\u2019t happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">Like I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t come up with one where that doesn\u2019t keep (inaudible at 0:06:10). (pause) You know, that the best I can come with is, things get better for awhile. (pause) Which at this point is not so bad. I have lots of (pause) but I feel like (pause) I feel like the period where I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">start thinking maybe this will just be over, like maybe I won\u2019t have to feel this way, and then it comes back. I feel like that is really bad; that it\u2019s the worst. And so \u2013 [0:07:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Sort of pulling the rug out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:08:49][0:10:49] (pause) (sigh) Somehow it still seems very important, because we have to learn now that this what my life is occurring now. (pause) I feel like the the little things that might \u2013 (pause) [0:11:49] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: You sounded worst to me actually than last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: At first, when you said about (pause) feeling freer less dependent, like putting stuff out there, I wasn\u2019t sure [in a way] (ph) good thing coming from it we talked about last time; it doesn\u2019t seem that way. As we talked more, it seems more like you don\u2019t care -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: In the way that even when you\u2019re feeling pretty bad, you generally still do? [0:12:44] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562258\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really bad. (pause) I mean it gets worse than this, but not that much worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I haven\u2019t forgot; I\u2019m trying to remember the last time it was like this; it\u2019s been awhile. (pause) On one hand, it\u2019s mostly an (automation) (ph) of self hatred and fighting amongst yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Even like the (fault) (ph) isn\u2019t as much a thing anymore. Like I don\u2019t \u2013 I ended up hurting myself. (inaudible at 0:14:23). (pause) [overlapping conversation at 0:14:33] Yeah, I don\u2019t know, I \u2013 (sigh) I haven\u2019t been thinking about hating myself as much. (pause) And sometimes it\u2019s blank. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">(pause) [0:15:33] (pause) It\u2019s still there somewhere, but I don\u2019t have to deal with it all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I \u2013 it took me the whole day to sort of tell myself like, \u201cYou know Tanya, really have to tell somebody at church about this. Like this is their job; tell them to do their job.\u201d And so I like at the end of the \u2013 as I was leaving, told one of the priests that I\u2019m doing really badly, and asked her to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">pray for me and she said she would . She said like, \u201cYou\u2019re awesome\u201d at the end; that sort of undid me. Not like a \u201cYou\u2019re awesome so you shouldn\u2019t be feeling bad.\u201d But more like, \u201cYou should remember that you\u2019re awesome.\u201d [0:16:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Which I guess \u2013 at which I guess you\u2019re a complete disaster? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes. (laughter) I sort of fail a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I guess my point being \u2013 my box over there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Almost sick. Man it\u2019s like the tissue box that will not die. (chuckle) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I guess that my point was that that\u2019s how I imagined that it felt, or that that\u2019s part of what made it feel so awful. Is that so far? [0:18:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, and my thought was that\u2019s completely the size of me. But, (pause) it\u2019s this weird thing, like I know why she would think that I\u2019m awesome; like I can see how I look to other people, you know, at least to other people who think I\u2019m awesome. (chuckle) I can see that, but like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">that doesn\u2019t matter. (pause) [0:19:00] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So the main thing is, that you\u2019re like quite a bit miserable and in a tremendous amount of emotional pain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I guess so. I mean if you poke at it like I\u2019m miserable, because I feel like I\u2019m a terrible person, and part of it comes around, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Like kind of, it sounds like that part of the story isn\u2019t feeling as central as at other times it, you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: And it sounds like also this doesn\u2019t have the kind of beat yourself up quality that feeling low can have? For you, it\u2019s more like, (pause) (whenever) (ph) like I get a sense that you\u2019re indulging yourself a lot, or blaming to yourself, or feeling (while) (ph) inadequate; sometimes you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">just feeling awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Anyway, when I like involve myself, or fend for myself, there\u2019s at least a presumption that things could be different. But I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s a possibility. (crying) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:21:12) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like the only computer game I remember playing ever. We never had computer games when I was little; we just didn\u2019t have any consoles, and never got any other. So, it was like a brief period of time where Golden Eye was like the game. (chuckle) It was a long time ago, but there was a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562258\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">And so like a little bit after it came out, I was over like a family friend\u2019s house, and there were like kids downstairs playing a game. And so I picked it up and played it, and just like could not \u2013 like I couldn\u2019t get the character who walked around out of the corner. Like I was just in a corner the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">entire game. (laughter) It was like well, that was it for video game; like not much fun when you can\u2019t get out of the corner. (laughter) So that\u2019s what I feel like. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Now, my sensation to not being able to get out of the corner in a video game, is that it\u2019s kind of disorienting, among other things. Like you can\u2019t \u2013 they move, and you can\u2019t figure out where you\u2019re looking, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, and in that game, everything\u2019s dark the entire time. I\u2019m like (inaudible at 0:22:45). (pause) It feels like you, and James and Dr. (inaudible at 0:23:13) is like people who are trying to help me. (pause) It feels like with the best of intentions, you\u2019re all [a bit afraid] (ph) to continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">down this incredibly painful and destructive path. (pause) That\u2019s disorienting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And you\u2019re welcome. (chuckle) (pause) [0:24:28] But I imagine in some ways, it\u2019s actually worse, in that not only are we inviting you, but especially James is in some ways making you feel obligated. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">I think that\u2019s especially (inaudible at 0:25:13) like, [I completely crave tuna.] (ph) I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I know. (pause) [0:26:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Now I think about it, yeah, you\u2019re right (pause) that there\u2019s a language that people are referring to. (pause) You maybe think I don\u2019t understand what you mean by that, but (pause) there are ways in the short-term (inaudible at 0:27:29). You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But, (pause) [028:29]-[0:30:29] (pause) I hear you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) Are you surprised?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Am I surprised?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Not really. (pause) [0:31:56] (pause) Yeah, I do. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Kind of like keep going in spite of how excruciating it is? (pause) [0:32:56] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t feel good about that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I imagine that (pause) feels like a lot of things have been a failure for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [0:33:58] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: [That\u2019s all beyond me.] (ph) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really like the alternative either. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: How do you think there are no good options?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: [It\u2019s not really been unbearable.] (ph) (pause) [0:34:58]-[0:38:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: (crying) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: The only thing in particular that I can (inaudible at 0:40:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Mostly (inaudible at 0:43:08] \u2013 things like the (sigh) highest likelihood of success, combined with what it\u2019s most likely I\u2019d actually do. (pause) Yeah; logistics are hard, but not that hard. They\u2019re hard if I want them to be hard.
