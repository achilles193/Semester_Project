I've been worrying about that. That's a lot more money than we have. I get worried about money regardless and so I'm worrying about money with regards to things that aren't as important to me as <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000E1\">this is and [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:54) and I also feel like I shouldn't need it in some ways. Yeah. Yesterday was not a very good day.  I would kind of watch an episode of TV, stop, and kind of be like, \"Okay, can I go back to work?\" And then I would start crying. I would cry for a little bit and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000E2\">I would be like, \"Okay, I guess I'd better watch more TV.\" (laughs) That was pretty much the day. I just feel guilty about it. Even though it's clearly the insurance's fault, I feel so guilty. I want to be taking care of you. Obviously, you need to be paid, but I also feel like I'm in the situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000E3\">that it's my fault (crying) that I don't know how to fix and nothing that I try to do to fix it makes me different.  I've been worse than I have for a while. Pretty bad and I don't know how to talk to you about it. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the self-injury the other day. I think that's something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000E4\">I probably should have told you about before. I think it was like, \"Well, if I tell Josh then I have to admit that I'm doing it to myself.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20010\">THERAPIST: You mean like if you're telling me then you're also admitting it to yourself? Is that what you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20011\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, we're borrowing money from James's parents to pay the bills, which his parents just finished paying off their house so they basically just send us their mortgage payment and their lives are the same. His father, I think, said he was kind of relieved that James was borrowing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200121\">money from him because he's the only one of the siblings that hadn't at some point. He was like, \"It's about time.\" (chuckles) James feels really bad about it. I feel really bad about it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20013\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014\">THERAPIST: This won't help much, but I'll say it anyway. [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:48) for a while and you've been the throes of a major medical crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20015\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I tell myself that. (chuckles) (pause) I keep thinking, \"I can't get bad enough to go back to the hospital because they won't let me have my computer to apply for jobs.\" Also it sucks but ... (laughs) (pause)  When I was in ninth grade I was in the choir with my two friends, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200161\">we took a trip to Europe for two weeks with the choir and did the things that choirs do there tour around and sing in cathedrals. It was a great trip, but my dad sent me out with $50 or $75 for the trip. That was for souvenirs basically.  He didn't realize or he had forgotten or something, but he <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200162\">didn't realize that the students were supposed to pay for about two-thirds of their own meals so it was tough in that regard. I ate a lot of bread and cheese and Cadbury eggs. It was Easter season Lent, actually. I ended up having to borrow like $200 from one of the chaperones. I think it was from <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200163\">the school's account or something.  I just remember being so ashamed and so afraid that my dad would be upset with me because it was a pretty expensive trip as it was not easy for him to pay for. It was just awful. (pause) Yeah, I don't do very well with money. (long pause)  Yeah, going to private <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200164\">schools was really good for me in some ways, but from when I was five to when I was 18, basically I was [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:05) insane amounts of money and I just didn't have any. I didn't tell my dad about when it was time to buy class rings because I was just like, \"Well, we can't afford it.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200165\">[0:09:34] (pause) [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20015-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099874\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20017\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20018\">I really, really wanted to kill myself the last day or two, more than in days previously. There is that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20019\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001A\">THERAPIST: It's gotten really bad again, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001C\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) I'm pretty much immobilized as far as tech. I can check my e-mail and avoid the e-mails that I don't want to read. (laughs) (sniffles) I scan school websites for teaching positions and kind of fly to the ones that I want to apply for and then sort of think about ... go to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001C1\">start the application, but I just can't do it.  I'm sleeping really late. I set my alarm for a reasonable time and then I turn it off because I think I can't get up. (pause) (sniffles) I'm trying to kind of take care of myself and let it pass and all. (sighs) (sniffles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001E\">THERAPIST: Most of the time you'd rather be dead?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I'm back to, \"Well, I told James that I'm going to stick around.\" That's what I have to keep telling myself. (pause)  I started watching West Wing yesterday. I don't know. I have so many friends that are so into it, and now it's on Netflix and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200201\">deal with it. I really like Aaron Sorkin's writing, but he just has to preach. He just can't help himself, especially about politics. I can deal with it in sports writers and things, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to deal with it on all things. (chuckles) It's also really good. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20021\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20022\">THERAPIST: I assume it's not so clear to you why you're feeling worse or what's making you feel worse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20023\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024\">CLIENT: I think not having a job and being worried about money is a lot of it. Yeah, I think that's a lot of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20025\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20026\">THERAPIST: That's been true for a little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20027\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028\">CLIENT: Yeah. So ... (laughs) Sorry, I'm not sure what's different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20029\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A\">THERAPIST: I take your point that that's a lot of what you've been feeling really awful about and it sounds like things that kind of trip the worst moods and things like that often have to do with that, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C\">CLIENT: Maybe it's that the independent school hiring season is coming to a close so, actually, it's becoming much less likely that I'll find a job and that I'll not find a job teaching; and it's getting to the end of the school year so people aren't going to be looking for new tutors. So I think I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C1\">should find a job in another field. James's going to finish his degree within the next two months and then we're going to go where he goes; and I don't know where that's going to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E\">THERAPIST: Do you think you'll likely move?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20031\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032\">THERAPIST: Do you think he'll likely be post doc-ing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20033\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034\">CLIENT: I think that's probably what he'll end up doing, but it's not because he really wants to so much as it's the thing that will keep the most options open.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20033-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099874\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20035\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20036\">THERAPIST: [From what I hear about post doc-ing, it might be.] (ph? at 00:18:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20037\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20038\">CLIENT: Are you kidding?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20039\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003A\">THERAPIST: No, no. I'm serious. Nobody wants to, but it keeps options open and, unfortunately, it doesn't prove to be something that you need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003C\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. If you want an academic job you have to get a post doc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003E\">THERAPIST: I mean, the industry is starting to like post doc, I think. That may depend upon what you're doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20040\">CLIENT: No, I think I had heard that and that's really depressing for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20041\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20043\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20044\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think he's still hoping that I'll find a job teaching and then he'll look for a post doc somewhere where I am; but I don't think that's going to happen.  (pause) Finding a job would mean that we have to change the therapy schedule around and I just don't know ... (trailing off) I'm just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200441\">really overwhelmed by it and really ashamed of being overwhelmed. (crying) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20045\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046\">THERAPIST: You feel really strongly that you should be able to handle things better and not get upset and that kind of stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20047\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20048\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause)  Then I start to think, \"Well, I think actually other people would be actually better off if I were dead (sniffles).\" And then I say, \"No, (chuckles) I have to remind myself that [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:00).\" (pause) (crying) I so want to say, \"I can do this,\" and \"I can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200481\">do this,\" with equal emphasis. (pause)  I'm going to play board games with Brandon tonight. That will probably be fun. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20049\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004A\">THERAPIST: I guess part of what makes it difficult to talk about here how you're feeling is that it's like so closely tied up with shame about feeling that bad and what you should be doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E\">THERAPIST: It means that you have to confront it and also that I see it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20050\">CLIENT: Yeah. A lot of it is tied up with being ashamed of being behind in paying you. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20051\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20052\">THERAPIST: You've been feeling really bad about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20053\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20054\">CLIENT: Yeah. I've been feeling really badly about it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20055\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess it's hard enough for you to come in here and not feel guilty and like I'm going to get exasperated when you are paying me. I can only imagine ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20057\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058\">CLIENT: Yeah. (both laugh) That's about right. (both laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20059\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A\">THERAPIST: But if you're behind with that it's much harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C\">CLIENT: I started crying before I walked over here today. I went to leave and I just started crying. That's the problem with you being good at telling how I'm feeling and what I'm thinking about things I don't tell you; but then I just assume that you can tell everything. (laughs) I guess you really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C1\">can't. Sorry about that. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:01)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's been [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20061\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062\">THERAPIST: That must be having implications for how you are here, like if there's something frustrating you or there's something that you think I wouldn't want to hear about anything that you might additionally, like that you more so feel guilty about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20063\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20064\">CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I didn't call you last night because of that; but I did think about calling you, but I didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20065\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20066\">THERAPIST: Call me anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20067\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20068\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20069\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C\">CLIENT: I don't know.
