Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Good morning. (PAUSE) The last two days I've stayed at work long past when I should have gone home and also late enough to miss evening commitments that I had made. Tuesday I was supposed to go to a student alumni networking event that helps for students of color. I skipped to stay at work to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">try and get shit done. And yesterday I missed choir practice. I was at work until nine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">That's not really healthy but I felt like since I was actually being focused and making progress, it would be a shame to leave and interrupt that because (inaudible at 00:01:15) the next day is going to be focused and productive or another day of fighting myself. It's also... Like the way my work day <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">is broken up, like most days I can't manage to get into work before about ten o'clock. And then the cafeteria is only open from twelve to one so if I don't take my lunch break then, I have to drive somewhere to get lunch. Which is kind of a pain and also most days I have meetings scheduled from like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">one to two or two to three so it's harder to take a late lunch. So I have two hours in the morning and then a lunch break which then, you know, breaks my stride and then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: ...trying to get back into work and then having a meeting and then trying to get back focused on the thing I'm trying to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I don't actually like get into a groove and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: ...really start focusing until about four.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: And then you're taking off at...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah 6:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Five or six.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's not much time. And I know various productivity experts say that, you know, you shouldn't work for more than ninety minutes at a stretch and you should take breaks every ninety minutes but I've found that for me, you know, the best block of time is about three and a half to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">four hours of just like intense focused work and then taking a longer break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah my... Necessarily what I've seen is that there's a lot of variations to what works for people...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:57)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I mean, the obvious solution to this is just, you know, get up earlier, get to work, you know, 8:30 and then have a nice big chunk of time before lunch and meetings and all that started. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: But that requires me to, you know, wake up early which is hard under the best of circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Sure because you're having trouble sleeping. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And when I'm dreading going to work and having trouble sleeping, waking up at seven just... It's not going to happen. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Although I managed to wake up at seven to get here on time. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well, that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Which means I can't wake up at seven if, you know, I'm sufficiently motivated. So why am I not motivated to get up for work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess in a way that's the big question.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098550\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, what's coming to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Not a whole lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Is there something that you're feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: It's not like I can't imagine...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: ...from what you've been talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: But I'm just not sure what particular thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: I don't know. Frustrated that I can't think of anything useful to say, frustrated that I can't get moving in the morning, frustrated at a whole lot of stuff. (PAUSE) So one thing that I'm kind of embarrassed to admit and I know is probably, you know, one of the things I should just get over <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">because it's not fair of me is that Dave will often, you know, sleep in later than I do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">And, you know, he has a fifteen minute walking commute to work. He doesn't have to leave an hour before he needs to be at work. And his hours are much more flexible than mine. So, you know, he can sleep until 9:30 but it's a little... It'd be nice if our schedules were synced like if he were willing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">to just get to work early and then he could leave work at like four and like have the whole afternoon free. But he doesn't and it's not really reasonable for me to require that he does but it's hard to get out of bed when he's still sleeping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Do you feel resentful of him or is it like you just want to stay there with him or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: A little bit of both. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: And he also doesn't need nearly as much time to get going in the morning as I do. Like I need at least an hour between waking up and walking out the door and he needs, you know, fifteen minutes. So he can wake up at 9:30 and be at work at ten and I can't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Right. (PAUSE) What is it that you need the hour for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: I usually spend at least ten or fifteen minutes lying in bed, staring at the ceiling talking myself into getting out of bed, shower, brushing teeth, drying my hair takes some time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">And then I usually want to check e-mail, Facebook, Twitter. And I've been trying to spend, you know, practicing piano in the morning because it's much easier if I focus in the morning that when I get home from work and I'm, you know, frustrated and tired and full of self loathing. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: I was smiling because I just thought maybe you should switch to drums. That might solve the problem of getting Dave out of bed in the morning. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: No. And then this morning Dave berated me when I came out of the shower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Because I've had this horrible head cold for like the last three weeks. And I'm really stuffy and congested and at night all of that congestion drips down into my throat, this post nasal drip so when I wake up, like my throat is just full of grossness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">And that triggers my gag reflex which then triggers vomiting and it's just really horrible and gross and disgusting. And so it's... And it's kind of noisy. And he berated me for being noisy and told me, you know, \"Why don't you just swallow it instead of coughing it up?\" Well, it triggers my gag reflex. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D1\">Once that happens, I kind of have no control. That was all, you know, autonomic nervous system function from that point onward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098550\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: And that was really frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: He was like, \"You woke me up!\" I was like, \"You went to bed at the same time I did. There's no reason for you not to wake up right now.\" (SIGH) But yeah. It's really... I can't demand that he leave for work at the same time I do. That's not fair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: And I've already told him, you know, this is something I would like and would he please do it and he said no.

I mean (PAUSE) there's a lot of depression sort of pretty intense in what you're describing, taking fifteen minutes to get out of bed. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: And I've trained myself out of using the snooze button for that because that does drive Dave crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: But... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I think you're sort of dreading work (PAUSE) and the frustration I think with your commute which one would not at all (inaudible at 00:13:21)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: ...doesn't help. I mean, like, yeah, it sounds like some of it's solidarity. Some it's resentment and affection as far as Dave not getting out of bed that's difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I guess the point in my mentioning it is, you know, I think you usually dismiss how bad you're feeling or the number of things about which you're feeling bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Which is dismissive of yourself and is really frustrating because then you kind of don't know what you're up against.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And so you seem completely irrational and, to yourself and people with whom you're interacting when in fact like, you're really up against quite a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: I kind of want to argue with that but that would just be proving your point wouldn't it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Well go ahead. I mean, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: I mean... (PAUSE) It doesn't really matter how I'm feeling in some sense because I still have to go to work.

But I had, I had checked in some code that broke the build and kind of screwed things up for like four other people and someone called me out in the middle of a group meeting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C11\">in front of the whole team of like fifteen people. And I kind of got, you know, not yelled at but, you know, publicly reprimanded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Ouch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, it kind of sucked. But on the other hand, I did break the build and that's, you know... (LAUGHTER) It actually was a mistake on my part but... My mentor came into my office yesterday morning to... He said, \"You know, I just wanted to say, you know, that that fumble you made with the code <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C51\">like I reviewed that code. I didn't see that it would break anything.

Even if it was something, you know, the other person would have expected to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">THERAPIST: But you were just so used to having those squelched up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: It's funny. I guess it's similar to with your boss in that (PAUSE) he would have imagined you to feel good about what he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">THERAPIST: I don't know if this is true for you but for some people also like positive feelings can be the most difficult or dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">CLIENT: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Well somebody can really put you down. You're already sad or angry (PAUSE) or scared and that could be bad but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT: Can't get much worse. Is that what you're saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Sort of, yeah, like... It's not like the rug's going to be pulled out in quite the same way if you're happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't know if that's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Caltech was your dream school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Then why didn't you go there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">CLIENT: Yep. My parents were adamantly opposed to my going to Cal Tech.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">THERAPIST: How come?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E1\">CLIENT: They thought that I only wanted to go because the boy I had had a crush on two years earlier had gone to Cal Tech.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Oh. Why did you like Caltech better than other schools?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E5\">CLIENT: It was smaller. The community seemed much more intimate. It was in California which is warm. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Wait. What? (LAUGHTER) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Were you quite upset about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201ED\">CLIENT: Very. I wasn't expecting to get admitted but they did and my parents wouldn't let me go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Were you... Did you know in advance that they wouldn't let you go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F1\">CLIENT: I don't think they expected me to get in either. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F3\">THERAPIST: I see. So they didn't freak out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F5\">CLIENT: So, you know, they only grudgingly let me apply and figured, you know, if I got in, it's the best fucking school in the country. I'm sure I can talk them into it. But no. Especially once I got acceptance letters from MIT and a full ride scholarship to Emery. They were like, \"You know? What the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201F51\">hell is wrong with you? MIT is more famous than Caltech.\" Which I guess is true if you're not an engineer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Which is what you care about knowing (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F9\">CLIENT: Yes. Well... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201FB\">THERAPIST: Had you ever wanted anything as much and gotten it as getting there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201FD\">CLIENT: Nope.
