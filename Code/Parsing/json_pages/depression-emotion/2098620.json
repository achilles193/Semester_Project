And they were like \"Why don't you go to the CVS in the other Square?\" and I'm at the one in this Square. I was like \"Well, when are you going to get Adderall in?\" This was Friday, I guess, maybe Saturday, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And they said Tuesday because the pharmacist had to order it yesterday, and then it would come in today after 8:00 p.m. I'm like well, I'm not going to take it until Monday anyway, so what's an extra day? So I haven't started it yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So I'll probably start tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: So how did the diagnostic process go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It was a series of questions, a lot of questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Of, you know, mild, moderate or severe or none at all, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: And, you know, the hyperactivity, none of that stuff registered. But most everything else did.

So I used to get pissed off at Jess because she would lose her keys and I would always be like \"Well, I never lose my keys. I never lose my wallet. I know exactly where they are. I come home <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">and put them in the same exact spot every time,\" you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: So that was a little strange to me. I mean, I guess if that's the only thing you do, you don't have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: But with everything else, I seem to be scoring. I don't remember a lot of the questions, but they were all \u2014 I mean, you would probably know what they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know the diagnostic criteria. I'm a little skeptical of some of the sorts of questionnaires for this kind of thing, but whatever. The bottom line is you try the medication and if it helps, that's great. If it doesn't help, then stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well, I told Jess and she was like \"Well, I suspected it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: I guess a main reason I wonder about it is difficulties with attention and even organization can relate to depression and anxiety as well. You know, if somebody is depressed they have a lot more trouble focusing oftentimes, and so with paying attention and following through, they tend to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">be a little less organized and just generally less on top of things. It can be difficult to differentiate which is which. I guess the primary way of doing that would be \u2014 there are a few ways to think about it. One would be through your history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">If you have ADD, then the extent to which you have trouble focusing and trouble being organized should be fairly consistent through your history. Whereas if it's due more to depression, then those sort of difficulties should increase or decrease along with the extent of your depression or anxiety. Do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098620\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: That's one way to tell. Really the gold standard for diagnosing something like ADHD is neuro-psych testing, which is a much more involved process that involves usually six or eight hours of (inaudible at 00:05:32) testing with a psychologist and then, you know, the creation of a written report <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">that is usually between six and 15 pages long or so, and that's kind of the gold standard for this kind of diagnosis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">But, you know, you may have it and the questionnaires are good in terms of they can be helpful and better than nothing. Like I said, the treatment implications are pretty straightforward and there's not a big cost in any way associated with them, so you may as well try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, she thinks that Ian has ADHD and she's meeting with whoever it is tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Whoever it is, like a mental health provider?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Okay, as opposed to \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I forgot the name or title \u2014 something. I've got it here in a text. Developmental pediatrician.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I would have that diagnosed by a \u2014 you know, the best bet is a neuropsychologist who does testing or at least a screening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">The second best bet is an actual mental health clinician. It could be a social worker, psychologist or psychiatrist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Way to poo-poo on her parade. She's had this appointment for six months. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: What do you want me to say?

You're like \"Oh, they need some mental health.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well I \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Not to be analyzing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) I don't think I'm covering my ass because I don't have a stake in it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: I care about Ian (sp?) \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Well yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: \u2014 and you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: But I don't have a stake a lot of times, but it's just more of a \u2014 it's not an actual cover-your-ass, it's just \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Right, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: People are like \"Oh, I've got this problem\" and if it's something I don't deal with, I'm like \"You should talk to a lawyer.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Right. But you're probably right, aren't you? I mean, they probably should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, it never hurts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: (laughter) I'm saying that it can be difficult to diagnose ADD and people can often over-diagnose it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">That's largely because there are other conditions that can result in the same symptoms. It's good to work with somebody who is more specialized. The most specialized people are neuro-psychologists. The second most specialized people are usually mental health clinicians that work with kids. The third <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200971\">most specialized are pediatricians. Not that they're bad, it's just that pediatricians do 900 different things, you know, 50 of which are mental health.

If every six-year-old boy whose cubby was a mess, who lost stuff, who didn't follow their parents' directions, who didn't follow through with things, was diagnosed with ADHD then there would probably be three six-year-old <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">boys and two of them who were asleep who did not meet the criteria for ADHD.

I had a title exam due yesterday that I kind of blew off. I was wondering if I had had the medication if I would've done it or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Sometimes they prescribe stimulants for people who are depressed too. I mean, I hope it helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: I was in the office doing it and there was a bizarre missing link in the chain of title. It was a lot of different lots coming from a lot of different ways. I had six of them. It dawned on me that this missing link, that they didn't put it in the title reference, but it had to have been through <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E11\">probate. It's like 2:30 and the probate court closes at 4:30 which I had Siri look up on my way flying down.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098620\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">I pull up the index and sure enough, the guy who had the property died with a will, and all I need to confirm is this one person was the sole heir of the will or the person in the will to get the property. But it's in storage, the file is in storage. They're starting to put everything in storage now <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E51\">which fucks me because these are \u2014 typically the late 60s and 70s are when I need probates and those older ones, they order on Fridays.

So I left the registry and said I'll just finish the title and explain that I need to follow up on this a week from now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">So for some reason, I decide to go get Chinese food. Whenever I get Chinese food, I get way too much and I eat it all. I basically just fell asleep on the couch and never got up and finished the title. Even waking up at 11 and was up for several hours, I just blew it off. And I'm not really even anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED1\">or stressed out about it. Really what was interesting is that Sunday morning was one of these days I get anxious about. I had to take Ian (sp?) to snowboarding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Right, you're taking him snowboarding and you're meeting Jess and then going to the game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: Right. Well, as we're driving out there I could just hear in Jess's voice when Ian (sp?) called her that she didn't sound good. She's like \"I'm throwing up, I've been throwing up.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: And I'm like oh shit, because the last time, the week before, I got in at about 11 and we had stopped at Dunkin Donuts and we didn't hustle to get out of there, so it probably would've been fine which was actually the first thing that kind of came \u2014 at first I was like, fuck. But then I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F71\">like, it is what it is and you know, if I'm a few minutes late then I'm a few minutes late. I get out to the slopes and Jess's mom agrees because they live right there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: So she's going to meet me and she chose a different gas station, right where she would turn onto the route.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT: But then Jess was so sick that she needed her mom \u2014 because Jess was going out to her parents'.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT: And that's what made it easy to meet, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: I see. She was just going to drive \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: But then Jess \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: But Jess needed her mom to come in, and so she was going to come in but she was going to do it with Ian (sp?). So she went in, and her dad ended up picking up Ian (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">CLIENT: So it all worked out. Just the whole thing, there was no anxiety, no stress, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">THERAPIST: Well, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">CLIENT: I have tickets to a rock concert Sunday night \u2014 when the AFC championship. My buddy can't find anyone to go, so I'm stuck with $120 worth of tickets \u2014 $130, $140 worth of tickets. You know, they show you where the buyer alerts are on StubHub. Well, first of all, there's been no sales this year. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201191\">There's only like six, seven, eight tickets available. But there are all these people with alerts at $100 so I put it in at $99, so we'll see if someone buys it today. Tomorrow is the last day.

That's why I'm wondering if the Adderall <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB1\">works, how much that will change things, just getting work done. Take a couple extra ones and I'll clean the apartment. Sir Speedy. And if they don't work, I'm just going to sell the rest of the bottle. I probably could do better than the Klonopin.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098620\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: So it's kind of a win all the way around?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know. It's like I just have to wait until Phish comes back to town and walk through the parking lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) Those people would want to go in the other direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: No, because once the show is over \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: \u2014 they have to stay up all night raging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: That's what I, you know, suspect. I've never taken \u2014 she asked me if I had ever taken stimulants before, and I paused because I used to take ephedrine in college when it was legal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Oh. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT: Or is it eph-e-drine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Ephedrine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT: I'd stay up late to work, to party, to play rugby. I used it as a stimulant. This was before I really drank coffee, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Did it help you study?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was very effective but, you know, they stopped the sale. I mean, you could go into a convenience store and buy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">CLIENT: They stopped that. You know, it's a bronchodilator so, you know. I forget the medication, but there was an over-the-counter that had it in it before they stopped that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">And when I would take it, I felt weird, you know, so I stopped. I was just like, this is crazy, so I turned to coffee. (chuckles) Because there was a story of a model in Florida that died taking a bunch of it. It was also used for weight loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">CLIENT: So I think I might've even been taking it for that as well. It definitely suppresses the appetite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">CLIENT: (pause) We're supposed to get some snow tonight. And of course Jess wants me to take Ian (sp?) to school in the height of the storm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">I've got to get up early. It's like yesterday I slept. I kept waking up but ultimately didn't motivate until like 10, just because I was tired from the game, standing and watching Ian (sp?) snowboard and then going and standing for another all day, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Oh, you stand a lot of the game?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E3\">CLIENT: My section stands the whole game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E7\">CLIENT: Because our angle, you know, we're in the corner. We just stand the whole game and tailgate. There are chairs but I stand, and my legs were pretty sore yesterday. Ian (sp?) progressed a little bit on snowboarding. I think they were going a little higher up, so they were going a little faster. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201E71\">While all the other kids didn't need help, he was holding the instructor's hands down the mountain. With the game being at 6:30 on Sunday, I won't have to worry about getting him out of there right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EB\">THERAPIST: You'll have plenty of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201ED\">CLIENT: I might try and see if I can get him some extra runs. He's never done the tow rope. They've got a little bunny hill. Like the teaching hills have magic carpets, which he did fine with. All the other kids are hopping right on it and he's like inching forward, you know. He's a cautious kid, though. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201ED1\">But after the lesson, there's just the bunny slope which has a tow rope. I don't know if I'm allowed to run alongside him as he's going up this thing to pick him up when he falls, because they'll shut the tow rope off.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098620\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: [Yeah, they'll shut it down].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: But someone's got to pick him up or he ain't getting up. (chuckles) But I've been rushing him out of there where, you know, if he wants to take some more runs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">CLIENT: He's got a lift ticket until noon or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Is he liking it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think, you know, he even said he had fun even with \u2014 to him, he doesn't see it as regressing. He likes it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">CLIENT: (pause) I went to the bathroom and did my morning puking routine, which has been less and less and less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">CLIENT: Sunday morning was \u2014 I think because we went over Mosbie's (ph) house and I was drinking, and so I think it may have to do with dehydration a lot too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. Like if you drink the night before, you'll do more puking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">CLIENT: Or even if I'm just dehydrated from drinking coffee or just not drinking water, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20209\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">CLIENT: So recently I've been trying to drink more water, but I have to get up and pee more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">CLIENT: This morning I woke up \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20213\">THERAPIST: You mean as opposed to drinking less coffee and booze.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20215\">CLIENT: \u2014 I wasn't nauseous. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20217\">THERAPIST: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20219\">CLIENT: Asshole. (chuckles) But I came back into the TV room and he was in his PJs, but he had his snowboarding helmet on. You know, if he doesn't pick it up this year, I'll do lessons again next year. He has it in him, you know, I think he's just a little nervous about falling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021D\">CLIENT: And I kind of whacked him on the head, you know, and he's kind of sensitive. Same thing with his bicycle helmet, you know. He starts crying when I do it, but for me it's just habit. You see a helmet, you whack it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20221\">The instructor accidentally bumped into his head when he was sitting down, and I could tell he kind of whined a little bit about that. I don't know if his helmet doesn't fit him or he's just sensitive, you know. So to make him stop crying, I told him to hit me in the head. He's not very strong. It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202211\">like \"harder, harder, harder.\" (pause) He started working on his Derby car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20223\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20225\">CLIENT: Oh God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20227\">THERAPIST: Pain in the ass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20229\">CLIENT: Well at least, you know, every year I'll be a little better.

I don't know. He wants to put football stickers on it. I went to the Cub Scout store to look for some stickers, but nothing really jumped out at him. Except all the badges and pins and buckles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2023F\">CLIENT: He was supposed to get a badge, but there was a miscommunication among the Scout leaders and he didn't get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20241\">THERAPIST: Oh no. What does he have to do to get it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20243\">CLIENT: I'm really not even sure. You've got to do what they call a go-see-it where they went to the fire department. Something with your family. I think some of the activities they do qualify. Helping out the old folks and giving them cookies and make Christmas cards for them, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20245\"><\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20244-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20244-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098620\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20247\">I think that's the community event.

If I was \u2014 but I won't do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202A9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202AB\">THERAPIST: We need to stop for now. We'll talk more on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202AD\">CLIENT: Yes. Closing on Friday. Hopefully I get my docs tomorrow. I'll have to work on that. But I have a feeling they'll come late on Thursday.
