(Laughs) So well I made them cry. The kids at work. But, that wasn't unexpected. Yeah, it's like it's been this weird thing where it's like both getting harder and I feel better about it at the same time. Like, it's like I'm not new to them anymore. So they're not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">like on good behavior anymore. Things are harder than they ever were. And Frank was home, the father was home most of the day, like most of the week, actually, which is a lot harder to deal with them when their parents are home because they really want to spend time with their parents. They like me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">pretty well but I mean they like me pretty well when their parents are home, too, and are much more willing to it's like they both want to hold hands with their dad when we're walking in a parking lot which is like, it's awesome, but it's also like sometimes you can't both hold hands with your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I feel like there was a brief period in my life where I was not shy and that's gone. Like I really like Frank but it's sort of awkward having him there in some ways like I talk to him and I don't know, it's hard. (Laughs) Yeah, and it's like just a little bit trying to figure out like how much <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">he's going to do and how much I'm going to do. Like, how much I should ask him to do but it's like he's working from home when he's home so I absolutely want him to be able to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: It's just awkward.

(Laughs) I think I might have made that up. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(Pause): [00:03:55 00:04:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I was talking with Gerry today. She just broke up with her boyfriend, which seems like it was a good thing. He was really in love with his idea of her and she was not really in love with him and he was kind of getting weird and controlling and apparently they mostly spent most of their time <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">at her apartment but he thought her neighborhood wasn't safe enough and he would like check to make sure her doors were locked and double locked and like close all her windows and she was like, 'no, you can't do that in my apartment. No.' So she was kind of, she would kind of write some stuff, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">was like stuff like that, and she was like 'huh, when I typed that out it sounds really out of line.' It's like yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes it was. But we were just talking about relationships and she, I think, is still having a hard time getting past her previous relationship from before the present one but I don't I remember the guy's face, but I don't remember anything about their relationship anymore. So, it was awkward. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">And I didn't feel like it was really the right time to say, 'hey, by the way, I don't actually remember Peter, can you explain what happened again?'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">(Pause): [00:06:01 00:06:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: The problem with working with kids is that there's not really an external standard that's good enough for you that I like. I have to work pretty hard to keep from second-guessing myself now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559778\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: You know, because there's like an hour where everything is wonderful and then an hour where they're screaming and you don't know why they're screaming and like (laughs). Like, no you really have to get dressed today. (Laughs) Sorry. Like the oldest one is not a morning person. It's like pulling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">teeth to get him to get out of bed and put on his clothes and eat his breakfast and he's not hungry in the morning. Well, that's fine but you know, in an hour you're going to be a little crazy person if you don't eat something, so you have to eat something. And then he's like we're going to be late. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">And I'm like, yes, yes, we're going to be late. (Laughs) I've been trying to get you to get dressed for half an hour. Yes, we're going to be late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Does he go to preschool or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he's just finished. So it will be all three of them this summer and then in the fall he'll start going to kindergarten and the middle child will start going to preschool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Where's he going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's in Burnley. It's like a school the school's only a couple of blocks from their house, which is great, but there's like this great park at the top of a hill like really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: The park.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. We go up there like every day. It's really fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) School?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, he goes there.

The kids making you cry, your worrying about intruding on Frank, Gerry's boyfriend kind of imposing on her and in a not very surprising turn of events, it makes me think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">about your worry about imposing on me, like if you're -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: (Unclear) that's not very surprising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Sorry. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) If you're being sort of I think like emotional or too proud about some things that are going on. I guess when you said that you feel like you're never doing well and are always second-guessing yourself working with them. I'm not doubting that at all, but it's more that I wonder if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">when it happens with the kids and maybe as you're talking now I sort of had the image of you almost like other things that they're doing that are frustrating you or that you're worrying about with them or with yourself or with me. Like, there's always sort of just more than turned into how are you doing? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">You know, are you doing well enough, like it's like a way of kind of keeping it all in too does that make any sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It like an evaluation and performance away from it's all like you imagine kind of like trying to manage yourself and probably worry about how your reactions affect me or the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(Pause): [00:12:03 00:12:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">(Pause): [00:12:24 00:12:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I think I should have something to say about that and I'm not sure I really do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(Pause): [00:12:56 00:14:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Did you have something else you (unclear)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I was kind of noticing myself like thinking I have to be talking or I have to (Pause) I have to say something intelligible, if not intelligible, then I got nothing.

(Laughs) And you know, yeah, James <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">and I talked this over our best conversations are in cars. It's easy for the combination to be but, you know, so I don't know what's going to happen. You know, he doesn't know what's going to happen. He talks more about moving to the kind of places we would want to be and I think partly I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200892\">I don't know whether I'm going to stay in Providence after six months from how and so it's like if I I want to be prepared to lose you. But that's ridiculous. That sort of preparation does it actually work? At best, it will just be a self-fulfilling prophecy like I'll say, well I'll stop relying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200893\">on Chad now so it won't hurt so much when I have to stop relying on him but I'm alrHoffstedery losing you.

It's like I have this job where if I don't go to work, (unclear) can't go to work. And so I have to be well, you know, and I certainly have to be well enough to take care of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">kids and like something I can take pretty seriously.

She liked the scarf, I think. She did the thing where she treated our mental illnesses and psyches as the same. Although in some ways I felt like I couldn't call her on it because she had just been rHoffstedering a book that I gave her like a couple of years <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">ago.
