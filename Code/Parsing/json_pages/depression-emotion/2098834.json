You can if you want to, but it\u2019s, like, you know, \u201cget hair appointments, call me if you need help...\u201d It\u2019s pretty basic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: (sighs) So this is not a question that I expect you\u2019ll answer, but, um... I\u2019m talking and I didn\u2019t question. But... so, talking yesterday about, you know, this relationship not being contingent on how smart I am and how hard I work. Of course, I\u2019m going to bed last night and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhat <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">is it contingent on? Like, what could I do to get kicked out?\u201d (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: (chuckling) I have a list.

(chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: (laughing) Thank you, I\u2019m sure it is.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Um... but yeah. (pause) Which I guess is kind of the same question that I, um, you know, asked when we first started doing this, you know (pause) what...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Is too far in doing here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) I can see why you would not want to answer that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I could see why you\u2019d want to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Well, that\u2019s good. Yeah. But, um... (pause) yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Do you have... what does occur to you, coming up eventful, in that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Well, I imagined that, like, if I were to hurt you, then that would be the end of it. Um... (pause) Realistically, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Like shooting me or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, or threatening you or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Um... (pause) You know, the... What do I think is realistic, and what do I think, is very different tracts. You know, the thought that scares me is the thought that, like, what if it just doesn\u2019t go anywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: You know. (pause) What if I\u2019m just... I don\u2019t get better at all, or don\u2019t progress, or... so on and so forth. Um... which is one of those that I don\u2019t necessarily, I don\u2019t think is realistic, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really how it works, but I also am very afraid of it. Um... (pause) because, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">know, I have to be smart and work hard. (chuckling) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">You know, obviously, like, if I kill myself, that would be the end of it. (chuckling) More or less. (pause) I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">I\u2019m like, (pause) seventy-five pages from being done with Infinite Jest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m getting there. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: How long is that book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: It\u2019s about eleven hundred pages. I\u2019m amazed that it\u2019s taken me so long. That should take me like a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: But I\u2019ve been reading in fits and starts. And I think every page is, it\u2019s like, ten-point font, and then the footnotes are like eight-point font? And so I think every page is like twice as much text as an ordinary page. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: So yeah, it\u2019s a really long book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles) You can kind of tell that the publishers have tried to make it less intimidating and failed miserably. But you know, very thin pages... (chuckling). I think... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too long. I think it\u2019s just right, for what he\u2019s trying to do. (sighs) You know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">I really hope, you know, I see a couple of tracts for the book to end on? And I\u2019m really hoping it ends on the more-or-less uplifting tract? Because I\u2019m pretty emotionally invested in this at this point, and... you know. I think it will, but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098834\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">Anyway, so there was a (pause) passage that I was reading yesterday or the day before. One of the characters is in the hospital, in like crazily intense pain, like you\u2019re like, drifting in and out of consciousness. And he\u2019s a narcotics addict, so he\u2019s refused painkillers in an effort to stay sober. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">Because if he takes painkillers he\u2019s going to go back. And so he talks about, or he thinks about, living not even a day at a time but a second at a time, or saying no single second is uninterruptable, living in a single space from heartbeat to heartbeat. That was good for me to read, good for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">think about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">So, going to work last night, I said, \u201cWell, right now I\u2019m just walking. And then I\u2019m going to get to work and I\u2019ll just be doing the things that I\u2019m doing every second, and then eventually it\u2019ll be over.\u201d (pause) Not so good for planning, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well, good for getting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Getting through things, yeah. (pause) Yeah. So... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">Yesterday I was a bit better than the days before, so... (pause) yeah. Not unmanageable. It didn\u2019t really feel unmanageable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I think the time left was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">That\u2019s what I used to do, um, at about this time in the semester, actually, when I start getting stressed out, I\u2019d just not think about bad, just not think about it at all. Just say, \u201cWhat do I have to do right now?\u201d And then I\u2019d do that. Or, \u201cWhat do I have to do next?\u201d And then I\u2019d do that. I\u2019d just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">work through the stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">I wonder if it\u2019s (pause) worth it all to be here, actually. Um... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I\u2019m kind of antithetical to avoiding reflection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. And (pause) I think you (pause) I guess we\u2019ve said it, there I have to talk about (pause) leaving those things, how they\u2019re there, like how much pain you\u2019re in, and how things are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. If I talk about it, it becomes true. And if I talk about it, I have to experience it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And, if somebody else hears about it, then that may have consequences, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Although it\u2019s also, I mean, like, active consequences and the lack of consequences that this caused? It\u2019s hard for somebody else to hear about it, and for nothing to happen. Like, that I talk about... it\u2019s hard for me to talk about how bad reentering, and there\u2019s really not much that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">can do. Um, you know, you helped calm and you center and that\u2019s good, but it just keeps getting really hard. So, like, if I talk about it, then I have to (pause) you know, I end up feeling more alone, or more helpless. Because it\u2019s just there. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Hurt is significant but I think there\u2019s a slight gap in what you said which I think is sort of an important word (pause) where, um (pause) you sort of went from saying of course I\u2019m not going to get it, my memory, but you said, it was something like, going from, you know, you say stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">and nothing happens (pause) to, \u201cbecause there\u2019s not much I can do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: And (pause) I think that \u201cbecause there\u2019s not much I can do\u201d is a sort of a, a more, like a more sort of grown up perspective? I think I know what you mean, I understand that. But I think... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098834\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: That\u2019s more distancing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, and I think (pause) again, it\u2019s something in that, it was the first part, I guess that why you can feel so alone, or so helpless, or other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: That just by knowing that there\u2019s a limited amount they can do, I still feel like you ought to be able to do something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, or you just want me to be able to do something. Saying stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">You know, I spend a lot of time trying not to get my hopes up. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">Yeah, so I I thought a lot about whether you would just say, I am wondering what I could do to get me kicked out, because I knew you weren\u2019t going to answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: That kind of thing. (pause) Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">You know, I\u2019m not really a very good subject at all. (chuckling) I guess in a sense that in the idea, I guess is to moderate your desires. I\u2019m not very good. I just want what I want. I wanted to walk. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: But I think what you\u2019re in your words, wanting help. (pause) Like wanting an answer to your question, I really need to do something to help you feel better already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (pause). Yes. (pause) But when you put it like that, it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to want those things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: But, um... (pause) I don\u2019t know, it just seems (pause) It seems like (pause) it seems like my life has tended to train me that there is not help to be had. (pause) Yeah. I guess I just (pause) feel pretty disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: I think this is a question you\u2019re wrestling pretty intensely with here, what kind of help are you going to get, and what difference it\u2019s going to make? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) And?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: You know, what happens when what people think will help me, or what is supposed to help me doesn\u2019t actually help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. So then I\u2019d kick you out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Um (pause) you know, more thinking of things like... (pause) people saying things like (pause), people saying, \u201cDon\u2019t isolate!\u201d And I\u2019m just like, \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t want to spend time with people.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help me. It makes things worse. (pause) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">(pause) But the things that I need are not necessarily the things that other people need, or the things that people think I need. So... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">I, um (pause) So, this was hard, the hard thing this week. I asked the priest at my church for help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Oh, did I tell you about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: And he suggested coming in and volunteering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. So he wrote back, and he was very nice, and suggested a couple things I could do. So I have to (pause) do that. I don\u2019t know why that is scary for me, but like, (pause) when I sat down to write the e-mail, I started crying because I wasn\u2019t worried. Like, that kind of crying.

And they say, \u201cDid he hit you?\u201d and I say, \u201cNo.\u201d And they say, \u201cOkay.\u201d (pause) And I have to insist, no, it was really bad. (sighs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F1\">(pause) It\u2019s much easier to say, well, I guess I\u2019m just a wimp. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: Right. Than to say, you know, a lot of time, he would get inexplicably get angry and blame things on me and get explosive, and leave, and I couldn\u2019t predict or control, but which, along with all the other things that happened, made me feel like I had to take care of everything so as not to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201611\">make somebody angry and feel like my parents were kind of there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah. That takes a long time to explain to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: That, and most of the time if I have to explain it to somebody, I don\u2019t really want that person to know me that well. (pause) Yeah. Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">I feel like I\u2019ve gotten a lot more cagey about (pause) letting people know who I am and where I\u2019m coming from, because I feel like people have exploited that a lot more in the last three or four years than they have for most of my life. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">I really don\u2019t like talking about how bad it is. It\u2019s hard. And it\u2019s not that I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s hard, because, you know, I work hard. That\u2019s why I come here, with the intention of doing the work. But (pause) (inaudible) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">There are a couple of long-term sub teaching positions that start in the spring.

Part of me thinks it doesn\u2019t look good on my resume to be jumping from job to job. And part of me thinks more teaching experience is better, I\u2019m looking for part time positions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Just day school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think I\u2019ll probably have to apply to boarding schools too, just because I need to cast a wide net to stay in this area. But I would rather work in a day school. Boarding schools are just a lot of work. And the kind of work that I\u2019m less capable of right now, I just don\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just more of a pain than anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2017A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098834\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah.
