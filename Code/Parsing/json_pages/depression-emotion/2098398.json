Josh made me go running this morning with the dog. (Laughs) So I feel pretty good right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Because he thought you'd feel better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I've kind of been wallowing this week. We didn't get great news from the doctor. My friend left. He had a bad talk with his mom. I was just kind of sucked into such an incredible week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you did really have a hard week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah and I keep having things that felt like they were going to get me out of it like I gave a talk at school and it was really fun and I got really pumped and then I came home and we were supposed to take his mom out for dinner and he had tried to go out to Staples by himself and like felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">like he was out of control walking so that kind of killed it. Every day I felt like I was like going to do a push through and then something would happen and I just couldn't cope. It's funny though, I didn't feel anxious or have trouble sleeping, I just kind of felt depressed. (Laugh\/cry) (?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: You had some sad things happen. I know you were upset about your friend leaving and that actually had to face this week and you said he had a difficult talk with his mom and you got difficult news from the doctor. So, those are all pretty sad things to respond to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was just funny because it didn't make me stuck and I pretty much just kind of made me not want to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: You were sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I slept (cross talk) (unclear) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: You are sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I slept more and his mom had brought me like six chocolate bars for Christmas and I ate chocolate and wallowed which is not the best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well, for a short time it's pretty appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: This all happened this week so if you wallowed for two weeks and then I'd say, well it's starting to look like depression because it's stuck around for so long. But sticking around for most of a week is still considered within normal range for reacting to sad news and difficult things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean on my little run this morning I decided it's better than what could have happened last year and I think it has mostly because Josh was a reason. I wouldn't say he's happy but he's not miserable. He's kind of acting happy. Poor guy. I asked him why he was so happy (laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: You did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckles) And he said \u2018I don't know,' because I think he's got more perspective. I don't know he just seems happier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: So what happened in the appointment? What did you hear and learn?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, so he got cardioverted on Tuesday and they said that his heart was like four times the size it's supposed to be, which we knew but it basically hasn't gone down at all. And if it had gone down then there would be like hope. So, there's kind of not much hope that that will continue to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You're saying that they're not believing that what they will do, will kind of allow it to shrink again but it's going to stay enlarged.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098398\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Probably, yeah. The doctor said it's one of the biggest hearts he's seen. He said he probably has a genetically large heart. He's an athlete which makes your heart really thick, so there was extra stuff to stretch out or something. All kinds of unlucky things. So, and then they put him on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">he got really badly, not really badly burned, but they gave him a lot of electricity this time and he got a really bad burn and it kept him up a couple of nights like he couldn't sleep because he has a giant burn on his back. And in fact, I don't know what exactly is going on and he's been acting so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">funny this week. The second day after he came out of the hospital we were driving home from the pharmacy or something and he was like, \u2018I want your parents to come over. Could you call them up and have them come visit?' I was shocked. I was like, \u2018really? You're actually asking people to come hang out?' <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">So I called my parents up and they came over the next day and he made them all dinner. So, that was really good. So like he's been and that's helps me a lot, despite the fact that I was still vomiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: So I don't know, it's really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: So we were kind of deciding it's much better than it could have been (laugh) now after dragged myself out of my wallowing. My friend has been like just sending us e-mails about her new life all week and how wonderful and easy it is. Sending us pictures and, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: What's that like to get those?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I'm so jealous of her. I mean I did that for three, four, five years ago and it's so exciting and full of dreams, full of energy, just going, going. Damn, I was extra bummed out because she was with us long enough that she witnessed I think a few days before she left, Josh, I don't know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">he did took too many drugs, didn't eat enough, whatever, he got really nauseous and nearly puking in the bathroom for a few hours and you know, she saw that, she saw stuff to know enough to see before and I told her most of the things that there was to tell her and she responded, unlike anyone else <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">has, like you know and I talked to her. Unlike Josh, who we talk about most things, how I feel and how he feels, probably more about how I feel, there's always guilt and like extra stuff that comes along with the conversations but, I don't know, she just completely understood whatever I was saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B3\">and still seemed to think that we were amazing and wonderful people and had a great life, so that was has disappeared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It's hard to have that gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: And the day we took her to the airport we took her at like 5 in the morning and we didn't get much sleep and I figured I'd just get, you know, have a (unclear)  day it started really early and I was destroyed all day. I don't know if it was the exhaustion (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Taking her, the leaving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: It was sad. Yeah, it was just a terrible day and then at night Josh had a talk with his mom and it was a really painful conversation to listen to. I'm not sure He didn't even talk to me about it. He was like, \u2018I'm going to go talk to her right now.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Do you know what he which things he addressed with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, I heard it. The whole thing. It was awful. And I was thinking I should go over there until he started sort of talking about me kind of, in a sideways way. I mean he is terrible at talking about something like that. His mom is ten times worse. The conversation was one of the most painful <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">things I that I've ever listened to. And, I'm not sure anything came out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098398\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: That's too bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I mean it didn't end badly. It just kind of ended uncomfortably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: How did Josh feel about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: He immediately came and asked me if he'd done a good job. Like, \u2018I don't know.' The two of you. We may [have] said some things without meaning to, like, \u2018I want you to be taken care of when you're old and not be a burden.' Kind of like, \u2018I don't want your problems,' some sort of (unclear)  to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">things and he tried to fix it but ended up asking her if she wanted us to take her out for dinner a few days later for her birthday and she clearly was like, I don't know if she was offended by that conversation but said, \u2018oh, no, no, no, you don't have to do that.' And then he like said he didn't actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">take her out for his birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: They're hard things to have happen at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: And then we didn't take her out because he like couldn't even walk to Staples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Not under your control or his.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: And she still barely shows any concern about it (laughs) and it's just a mess. So anyway I couldn't handle it all this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: That's an awful lot to try to handle in one week. You had a lot thrown at you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, they also, they gave him extra drugs to lower his heart rate even more and if it goes low enough there's like a built-in pacemaker that your heart will kick in and he kind of has it naturally because his heart rate is so low they call it the conjunctional rhythm. And he woke up in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">middle of the night feeling like he'd just been shocked. The second night and that was really scary and didn't call the doctor and I was like, \u2018oh my gosh, take less drugs.' So, and again now that I think about it he's been dealing with it fairly well. I just kind of I guess, haven't been too rough <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">on him, been bummed out about it all. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like he's got some sort of perspective that you haven't had yet. Maybe it's different to be the patient versus the one watching the patient, your (unclear)  positions with regards to all this. I think part of what's hard for you is you have a choice and he doesn't. And sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">it's harder to be the one with the responsibility of making a choice. You can choose whether or not you want to stay with him and watch this unfold, figure out what it means for your life. He doesn't have the burden of making that choice. He just has to cope with it. Which isn't a good place to be either. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">But in some ways it's a little bit easier because there's no he has no choice but to cope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah and I don't know what would happen to those feelings of wanting to run away. I don't feel like that. What is really confusing we also went for another doctor's appointment in which I asked him and this is not the doctor who did all the procedures this is a regular radiologist who <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">gives him mostly medication and (unclear)  so he's not the person to ask but he said that in his opinion if this doesn't hold then there's really nothing more to do so just deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098398\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Is this like eventual transplant or is that (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I don't know. They pushed the pacemaker before. They didn't bring it up yesterday. Maybe he just didn't want to go there. I don't know. Josh talked to him about [inaudible] (ph) stem cell trials and I thought he was kind of out there but the doctor was like, \u2018sure.' I don't know, I mean it won't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">kill him yet, right now. He's still healthy and strong enough that it won't kill him unless he has an extreme stroke or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Is that more likely? Is that the risk factor for him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's a big risk but that's why he takes some of the medications that he takes. Yeah, it's manageable for (unclear) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: What is the foreseeable future? Is that 10 years, 20 years, a decade? What is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don't know. I mean the doctor couldn't answer those questions. I'll have to see the other -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: The surgeon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: The surgeon. He can tell us more than, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: And you want to have answers of what the future would hold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it really helps. I feel terrible that I really (unclear) go out like this. This is hard and Josh seems to be in a better place about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: It's okay that you don't get to the same place at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">(Pause): [00:12:28 00:12:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you didn't anger him that you weren't exactly where he was and that your reaction was different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: No. I don't know why he's not as affected by me. I mean I've also just been just frustrated this whole week that my friend leaving and him being in the hospital, even in a happy mood, I mean it's just like I can't keep myself together. I don't know, I don't know what it is. It just frustrates <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">me constantly. Like, giving this talk and having my lab really support it, who I gave the talk to and you know I even had somebody come in and ask me if I wanted to (unclear)  before and was just really, really supportive and I was just like jazzed, crazy jazzed and happy. Bizarre that he's I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">know anyone else who gave a talk. My friends think I'm nuts my lab mates. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It's nice that you like what you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Well, speaking in front of people is cool I get jazzed from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: It's not a bad thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: But yeah, in a room full of people like laughed because I said something silly and I'm just like, I get so happy. But, then after I started thinking about how this is a problem and my personality and I wish it wasn't this way because some people are sad, I get depressed or sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you have extreme reactions -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: (Unclear) sorry, (sounds like crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: There's no need to apologize for your feelings. You have strong feelings so you get really pumped when there's something to get up for and you get a good reaction and it sounds like you had a good talk and you get really sad when there's something sad. That's just part of who you are and it's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">(Pause): [00:14:32 00:14:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: (Whispers) It makes me feel crazy. (Crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: It doesn't seem crazy from where I sit. I wonder why it feels not okay for you to have those highs and lows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: I don't need other people to drag me out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Or run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Well, if someone making me go.

I was in control of everything because I didn't have a boyfriend or dogs or crazy boyfriend's mother, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: And crazy heart conditions. You didn't have that stuff to manage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Or family or anything. But I'm sure if I was alone again, it's gone now, it's been ruined. So, which is why I was so jealous of my friend who, she's got -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: She's doing what you did back when you felt like everything was really under your control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I hope that she never loses that. I hope that she keeps it forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean in a way it's like your innocence has been shattered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean if I stay stuff like this to Josh then he just tells me I'm being silly and you know we could be in much worse places. But again I told him that doesn't help me and it makes me feel worse that I have feelings like this at all when people are having some kind of a hard (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: It sounds like one of the part of what makes it so hard is not just individually what you're facing but that up until all of this stuff existed in your world you were able to believe this illusion that things were under your control because you hadn't yet come up against something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">you couldn't control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: And I don't think that it's that you've actually lost an ability to control everything. I think it's that now there's stuff that's not controllable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Josh used to tell me that you can't really succeed as an athlete unless you've had a rough childhood and learned to overcome difficulties. (Laughs) I used to get so mad. Maybe it's true. Maybe you need to have something terrible happen to you when you're younger and you can cope and maybe it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">ruins you more, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems like having to overcome something like he's saying gives you practice at kind of getting back up again, being resilient. I don't think it's the only way to learn that. Being resilient is definitely a piece of being an athlete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Not at all. Well, his -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Ah, but you're learning it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, but there's more costs learning it now than there would have been -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you're very aware of all the costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: in high school. And you know I have to keep my life going unless I go back to my parent's house and live in their basement. No. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you have a lot of responsibilities than you did then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I could have more. (Laughs). Ah, so Josh's idea of why I needed to have a bad childhood to be happy is that you can push through suffering and suffer a speed cyclist they say if you suffer for hours and hours and hours it was just a New York Times article about athletes who <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">get really, really injured and thrown out of their sport and how it ruins their lives. I think Josh was actually really happier even, was it yesterday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Well, it's validating for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, well I mean really bad injuries like you're paralyzed or something, they have no more friends, their friends are all still in sport and don't want to be around them because it reminds them what could happen to them and so on and so forth. It really was depressing. There was no good ending <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">to any of the stories five or six of them. I couldn't keep reading it. I mean there were several stories of cyclists who have died of heart problems mostly because of drugs and doping when their hearts explode or something. Which is awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098398\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: He found some solace in seeing other people -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: I think he felt validated, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">(Pause): [00:19:19 00:19:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: This is an experience that a lot of people can't empathize with because they haven't had their world's revolve around sport and their fellow athletes in a way that he did and professional athletes do so to be able to read stories of people who are experiencing what he's experienced and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">being able to connect to the world and connect to people in the way that he always had relied upon -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess that's why I'm so happy that he's, I mean he let this girl in to see what was going on and I don't know what it is about my family that he feels so comforted by -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: And he really does feel comfortable with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's really nice. So, maybe he's turned a corner, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: He's finding a new way to kind of fit in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, if he could get a friend -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: If I could get a friend. Another one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You could give yourself a little bit of time. You're not losing your friend because she moved but she's clearly going to be a part of your life in a different way. She can still be a great friend. She can still listen and understand the way she does, she did when she was here. You need someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">to go do stuff with. Somebody else to meet for a run or a walk with your dogs or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Anything, yeah. I mean it's also tough that he finds such solace in my family that can drive me nuts. We were going to visit them a week ago with my friend also and my dad, he's done this a few times, like he was telling my friend Sophie about how hard it is to watch his kids have relationships <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">and how scary it is and how terrifying it is for him as a father and you know he's around the other side of me from her this is like when he told my friend did I ever tell you about this? He told my friend that he thought that Josh was going to die last year when we were out to dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: No. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Last January I was having a horrible time. I may have just before or just after having run away for some period of time, I don't know exactly, but I forced myself to go meet my parents and a friend of mine for dinner and I think it was right after Josh's ablation, first one. So he was in bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">shape. I was in terrible shape and he said to my friend next to me that you know he was worried that Josh was going to die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Which was everyone's worry, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: He didn't say it to me or talk to me about it, he goes to my friend and then my friend was like freaking out to me after on the way home asking me why he would say that to her and how upsetting it was. So then he basically did a similar thing recently and I know he's not terrified about my brother's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">relationships. There's nothing terrifying about that. I mean, maybe he thinks about it but the only one not terrified (laughs) of relationships.

Not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: What's it like for you to know that he's scared of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: It's terrible. It's awful. I'd like him to be supportive and he could tell me that he's like worried but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Terror feels a little strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Or it could imply that he's worried for you but accepts the relationship for what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: It would be nice for all of you, for you, for Josh, for your dad if there wasn't this looming question of what will his health be like and he thinks that it is pretty terrifying. You never know what's going to happen for anybody but it would be nice to be able to live under the assumption <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">that things are going to be easier than the assumption that you're living under.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Even if it's not a correct assumption. It's nice to be able to think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: I keep waiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and believing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">(Pause): [00:23:56 00:24:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah, Josh when he had the procedure done, before and after, he is so anxious. I mean he stares at the monitor just waiting for his heart to go to rhythm which is reasonable because sometimes it does. You know, he wouldn't eat anything after he got his last procedure done just in case he went <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">out of rhythm so that he could do it again, just in case. And this can't be the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: For how long did he do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: I mean they keep him there for like an hour or so. That can't be good for your recovery or anything. I keep teasing him about how we both should go to meditation and I'm kind of wondering if we really should because this week he hasn't been walking around staring at this heart looking depressed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">but I'm not sure why actually. But he gets into a period of doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Well, meditation certainly wouldn't hurt. You know when we do the breathing exercises and the mindfulness that's a type of meditation, the same family and it does give you at least a brief moment of respite from your worries and sometimes you know getting a little break from it is what you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">need. It doesn't necessarily change a whole day of what you're feeling. It gives you a break from it. With a regular practice of meditation you know a lot of people do get a more standing benefit of decreased anxiety, increased acceptance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">(Pause): [00:25:40 00:25:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Is he receptive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, actually he is.
