This is my (inaudible at 00:00:08) I\u2019ve told you a couple different things, and I\u2019ve probably told you, but if I\u2019m repeating myself, it\u2019s a project I\u2019m, that I was doing in Europe. And I mean making this website for it, and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019ve only told me a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Here and there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the independent reviewer for Europe contacted me last week. I interviewed him in July, and so he\u2019s got this little report that he\u2019s going into. His lectures are given at the end of February and (inaudible at 00:00:55), so I find him and say, \u201cHey, this is great.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">By the way, I\u2019m watching his website, and here it is. He got all excited about it, he wants it tweeted, he wants it like his website which is great, and he said, \u201cOh, and by the way, the Miranda ruling,\u201d which was David Miranda was held for nine hours and he threw a partner Glenn Greenwald, Snowden <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">materials, all that happened at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">That really was supposed to come up on Tuesday, so, and he said, \u201cSo, there might be a lot of people interested in the truth,\u201d so it has, Tuesday, so I\u2019m like, \u201cOh shit, I have to get it done.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right, you want to have it looking good for Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Exactly, so that\u2019s where, it\u2019s history, at the, you know where schedule 7 came from, and I\u2019ve got like eight interviews that I still have to transcribe, but if I could just put a couple of them up there, which is possible, just to have, let people know that they are coming, and so on and so forth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So I\u2019m reading transcripts of parliamentary debates from 1974 right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">And they\u2019re fascinating, and I need some coffee, so yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s exciting to have stuff happening with it, I\u2019d imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is, it is, and I\u2019m, you know, thrilled that I mean, I think for so long I\u2019ve dreaded not having something to show for that time there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re going to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And I am. That\u2019s, it\u2019s you know, like three months of the entire eleven months I was there, which is you know, I think, remarkable in itself, and it makes me proud of it. And that I can kind of get it off my chest because of everything that I do I always fear that I\u2019m not going to finish it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">or it\u2019s just going to languish. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And I\u2019m going to have something to show for it and a product to point to, so anyway, that\u2019s all, so sorry, I\u2019m a little bit sleepy. I was wide awake a half an hour ago. Yeah, so. Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the medication or the regular exercise or diet or whatever, or the work I\u2019m doing here, but I\u2019m actually feeling like living a life that I choose deliberately, for the better or there\u2019s something that is possible, or becoming possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">And I don\u2019t deny that there are pitfalls, there are limitations and fantasies and close calls, but by and large, that\u2019s kind of what being human is about. You know, any of that, wherever\u2019s safe from failings is really been less and less. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">And we\u2019re certainly not, I am certainly not destined to fail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a shift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is, it is. And you know, to go from feeling like well, it\u2019s inevitable to well, it\u2019s possible, but not, never, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It gives you a lot more power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Even possible is not tragic in itself, so that\u2019s something even in the past week I feel like the past two weeks, actually, it feels like is positive step for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">And you know, I\u2019ve also been able to put a lot more structure into my life, actually putting in places tips and tricks that the course on procrastination, all of the tricks he taught us, and they\u2019re working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: What are you finding useful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well, actually putting things on my calendar like I\u2019ve got this recurring \u201cto do\u201d tasks on my iPhone that every day comes up and I read for half an hour. Well, I\u2019ve been wanting to read every day for a long time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">But unless it\u2019s something that sticks in my face, you know, \u201cOh yeah, I want to do that.\u201d You know, it\u2019s actually happening. I play guitar for half an hour. It comes up every day, and a half an hour is nothing. And you know, adding those to the list, making them a priority is very simple, a very simple <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">task. But it says something about the place these things hold in my life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think adding to the list is pretty easy, choosing to make them a priority and following through on that in a daily way is, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s easy or hard. It\u2019s very meaningful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, and for me, it is a first step and in that it\u2019s meaningful, but it seems like it\u2019s accessible, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sounds like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and you know, going to the gym is on there, and I\u2019m still trying to, you know, stretch out a bit in using these tools, but what I do with my time, I don\u2019t have the best, it\u2019s damaging. It\u2019s damaging after the fact to say, \u201cI sat around for three hours and did nothing but peruse Facebook <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">or IM, whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">And when I\u2019m in that moment now, and I\u2019m doing something mindless and useless, I can stop myself and say, \u201cWell, what\u2019s on my list?\u201d And I know there are things on there that I don\u2019t necessarily want to do or can rationalize putting them off, but I know that no matter what happens with the half an hour <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">of guitar playing that I do, no matter what happens with that, I will be living in a way that I choose and that I want to, and that\u2019s, you know, you feel kind of paralyzed by the undefined, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">When your whole day is wide open and you\u2019re not doing anything, you\u2019re not doing anything good, you\u2019re not doing anything bad, you\u2019re not doing anything and it\u2019s probably for some people it\u2019s a dream, but for me it\u2019s paralyzing, and demoralizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">And I think the process of putting it on the list and following through with it is actually, I don\u2019t mean to make this sound negative, but it\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s keeping me to account for, to account, to make good on living the life that I want to live. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s holding you accountable for\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: And then you get to feel good about it, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: So you put it on the list, you did it, and then you can feel good that you did what you wanted to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Followed through on your intention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s not just the satisfaction of checking things off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Really checking off the thing that is meaningful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: That is meaningful, and if you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re going to feel bad from not having done it. Those things just kind of snowball and become big monsters, so yeah, I mean, the, those processes are developing for me, and I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just, for the moment, enjoying them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s where I\u2014part of my reading is a book I picked up in Europe. It\u2019s probably a US publisher, but it\u2019s anxiety and depression workbook which you\u2019ve probably seen. It\u2019s like this thick, this big, anxiety and depression. (inaudible at 00:12:53) bought all these services and so part of it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">part of the thing it talks about is PMR. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">And exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Is that the one by David Burns?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Maybe. Is it green and white?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: If it\u2019s him, there\u2019s like a gazillion editions of it, so I don\u2019t know what the most recent one looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I think it actually might be. That sounds familiar, but anyway, it\u2019s a few years old and whatever, it\u2019s, and certain DPT (sp) things that I\u2019ve forgotten. So it\u2019s that, and I have a book on the Middle East, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m reading right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: It may be good to kind of do them in conjunction. I mean, I get a little anxiety-provoking book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Complex history there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: And\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: The workbook skills are important. You said things to this effect before, oh, stuff you should know already or stuff you\u2019ve learned before, and I\u2019m seeing you\u2019re kind of disparaging yourself for not remembering it always freshly all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: But of course, those kinds of skills are things that they need to be practiced all the time or they do kind of fall by the wayside and I think part of, you know, just as you said, you are human, of course you\u2019re not going to be perfect. Of course you\u2019re going to forget to put them into place <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">sometimes, and there\u2019s going to be times when you\u2019re more consciously aware and so you know, the idea of kind of having something that refreshes your memory, you\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh yeah, remember this thing that I practiced before?\u201d Remember making time for PMR or remember, you know, doing the opposite <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200832\">emotion? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, I remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Those are all things that you do need some, you need something to help you remember to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: And I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping the workbook, but also you know, the calendar and the reminders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Right. Those are all ways of kind of, \u201cHey, pay attention to what you\u2019re doing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have this app in front of me, but I had an app to remind me to drink water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: You do. You probably laugh yourself, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: I think drinking more water is a fabulous thing for most people to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I don\u2019t think people quite realize how much water they need and how much coffee they drink and things like that, but you know, that actually helped me stay hydrated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: And you felt better for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: I felt better for it, and I have it happening more and it\u2019s, you know, set it up as reminders to, you know, stretch more, whatever. They are helpful to me, and they remind me to do things that I know are good for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Before everybody had cell phones they walked around with that could remind them of these things, one of the things that, you know, I used to do with people was, \u201cWhat can you set up in your environment that can be a natural reminder?\u201d You know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inherently wrong <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">with having it on your cell phone either, now that we have. You know, back in the day when I first started practicing, nobody walked around with an iPhone, so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Well yeah, and even that is, you know, I\u2019ve got this stretch I\u2019m supposed to be doing three times a day and I just have it on my wall so that I can, when I walk by my room, I see it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You see it.

Like there are probably other things that you do all of the time pretty regularly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">And you probably brush your teeth a couple times a day, and you can tag things, you know. So like the, whether it be those stretches or remembering to do ten deep breaths, you can tag it to something else that you already do as a natural sort of repetitive practice in your day. You know for when the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">iPhone reminder becomes stale, because one of the things that sometimes happens is when the thing\u2019s novel, you know, you pay attention to it and la dee da, but then after awhile you become sort of immune to that response or that reminder or it pops up at a time when you can\u2019t possibly do it. A reminder <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A12\">comes up because you\u2019re driving, and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t drink water right now. No, absolutely, and I think that\u2019s part of it. You see, it\u2019s happened yesterday, and today when I was actually working on this. A reminder came up to read for half an hour, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI can\u2019t do it right now.\u201d This is basically as important, but I will not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">dismiss it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">I will just snooze, or it will still be\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You can go back to it later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: So anyway, that\u2019s what I\u2019m just trying to institute some things that are helpful that I know I want to do and sometimes have a problem executing, so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Do you notice any connection or any difference when you said in the past couple of weeks you say you\u2019ve been feeling better about yourself, have you been doing this? Does that impact how much of the time you\u2019re having thoughts that you don\u2019t like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s interesting you mention that, because I know that, I don\u2019t know, that for some reason my grandma comes to mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">But idle hands make sin or something. You know, and it\u2019s interesting to notice that when I\u2019m not on task for whatever reason and how those temptations don\u2019t enter, and it\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re not on task they don\u2019t enter, or when you are on task?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: When I am on task they don\u2019t enter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t enter, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: They don\u2019t enter, and it was funny, I was in the store yesterday and I have such the temptation, or the fixation or just frequent habit of checking women out wherever I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">And so here I am on task, and I am thinking to myself, and I\u2019ve actually thought about this off and on for awhile now. What are people thinking about when they\u2019re on task, when they\u2019re out in public? How productive are they being? How present are they being to what they\u2019re doing if they\u2019re not caught <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">up in doing what I\u2019m doing? Does that make sense? So I mean\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Where are their thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Where are their thoughts, and how does this help them? What does it allow them to do or work through, process, be present to and that I am not doing? And I was hard-pressed to come up with something in the store yesterday when I was like, \u201cI\u2019m really present to shopping for, you know, cashews <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">in the bulk section, or something.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">And I just couldn\u2019t quite, and I\u2019m still working on that, and you know, in some ways it is similar to when I\u2019m walking the dog and present to what is around me and I\u2019m looking at things and thinking of ways to describe things as a means of developing my communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I think a food store is a perfect place. There\u2019s plenty to notice. Plenty of colors, plenty of displays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, that\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s hard not to get, you know, snarky about all of it while you\u2019re there. And yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">But I\u2019m sure\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s not necessarily being present. You can be present when you\u2019re snarky about the gorgeous displays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Very true, or the expensive prices or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: How much they\u2019re charging you for those displays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. Or how many of the sample bowls are just empty. No, the\u2014what I do when I\u2019m present, and how I deal with it kind of, as an extension of your question about the influx, the presence of negative thoughts or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Unwanted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Unwanted, yeah, when I\u2019m focusing on the things that I want to get done during the day, being present, again, is one of those things that I forget to do, and although I have that one technique of finding new ways, different ways, creative ways to describe what I\u2019m seeing, you know, I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">I\u2019m new to this and that I am bound to discover other ways of being present that are satisfying and maybe not productive. You know, like I seem to be focused on having something to show for whatever it is I\u2019m doing any time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">But until then, I\u2019m probably just going to be floundering with presence and distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Getting comfortable with not having thoughts, I think, is a really challenging piece of any type of meditation or being present, because being present is really just meditating throughout your life. And you don\u2019t always have to be in a perfect state of meditation. But part, I think, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">the next place for you to do is one of the ways you deal with it is to try to direct your thoughts. I think another tact is getting comfortable with not actually having thoughts, and letting go, letting your mind be an empty space. Here I am in the store, going about, you know, getting the stuff on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D52\">my list, and not necessarily engaging in any, you know, dialogue in my head, or thinking deeply about anything. I\u2019m just walking in the store. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">And I think one of the ways that that might be uncomfortable to have happen is that you let, a lot of times in your mind, is not thoroughly engaged in something, the thoughts you have make you uncomfortable in some way, whether it be in the moment or later you feel uncomfortable about having had them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">And so, you know, at some point, letting yourself have no thoughts and see what happens, and then moving on from it, and then moving on to a place where maybe you do direct your thoughts or get lost in some other thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: I have no idea what that would look like, but that\u2019s not to say that I won\u2019t someday. I\u2019m just being honest. To be without thought, and maybe I\u2019ve experienced it and I hate to acknowledge it or realize it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re playing music, do you ever feel like you\u2019re in the zone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a time without much thought. I mean, generally when an athlete, or a musician, or a performer talks about being in the zone, or in flow, there isn\u2019t a whole lot of thought. It\u2019s just sort of automatic process and response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s interesting. When I\u2019m reading, sometimes it\u2019s just so easy to just go in this direction of thought. I\u2019m still reading, (inaudible 00:26:36). I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Is there ever a time when you\u2019re reading and that doesn\u2019t happen, that you get totally absorbed in what you\u2019re reading? Maybe something lighter? Do you ever read anything lighter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: The anxiety and depression workbook doesn\u2019t lend to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Doesn\u2019t lend itself to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Nor does the Middle East book. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">But yeah, I think so. But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Or like watching a movie or something that has, you know, really has a plot you can get into?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know where you\u2019re going with this, and it\u2019s true. I do have fictional experiences and exposure, but I don\u2019t know, I think it depends on how interested I am in what I\u2019m reading. Sometimes (inaudible at 00:27:40) because\u2014but, getting back to the idea of not having thoughts, I guess I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">so new to life, I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">But the, going through the store, walking down the street, on task, going to the supermarket, getting groceries. Yeah, I just, I don\u2019t know. I guess when it comes to mind, I wonder just how much the anxiety that I have within me is creeping into that. Yeah. I\u2019m sure somebody\u2019s written about this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">But it seems to me that in the past fifteen years, and you can tell me what you think about this. But it seems that there\u2019s so much uncertainty and the world is going in so many directions all at once. The information\u2019s just good information, bad information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: And a lot more information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Irrelevant information, it\u2019s all coming at us in more ways. Before it came through printed materials and radio and television. Now it\u2019s like every gadget, and I don\u2019t mean to make it sound like it\u2019s sort of back in the day story, but it just seems like for a person like me and millions of other <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">people who are working through life, trying to figure out what\u2019s important, what\u2019s not, there is anxiety there about what is necessary in order to compete. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">To be a candidate for work, for professional goals, for you know, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still working through this, but I do think about it sometimes because I think there is this latent anxiety about ignoring the Twitter trend, for example. You know, it\u2019s not a very good example, but it does\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re afraid if you ignore some piece, then that\u2019s going to have ended up being, or it will be an important piece for something significant like an appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, or happiness, you know. I mean, I think, I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like if you don\u2019t pick up on the one trend that\u2019s important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">It maybe because you\u2019re focused on a trend that it is important to you, like guitar, for example. That doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re going to be doomed because you don\u2019t have a job. You\u2019re happy because you\u2019re developing the guitar. But I\u2019m not articulating this very well, but I think the, I just think the, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">maybe I\u2019m wrong, but it seems like the world is so much more intricately woven or the appearance of that is the case where you just don\u2019t know where you fit into it all. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: Right. I don\u2019t know that the world has actually changed that much. I think that what\u2019s very different about our experience of the world with all of the technology and social media and information that\u2019s been available to people at a moment\u2019s notice now. I think the difference is that we\u2019re, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">we\u2019re now sort of used to, and we expect to have instant information and a lot of it whenever. Like you said, it used to be that you know, people watched the six o\u2019clock news to find out what happened during the day. They didn\u2019t need to know about it moment by moment and they didn\u2019t need to know about every development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">As we watched the marathon (inaudible at 00:32:50), people, you know? It used to be that you went, and you picked a spot to stand, and you saw the runners go by at that spot, and then you found out when they ended because they told you who finished when. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">Now, you tag your runners and you know exactly where they are on the spot, for all twenty-six point two miles. You don\u2019t need to know that. Nobody needs to know this except maybe the, you know, significant other of that runner who also doesn\u2019t even need to know because their marathon had been run for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">eons without anyone ever knowing that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">So I think the challenge now is to figure out where to, we need to now be in charge of putting some boundaries on how much information we take in, how frequently we seek out information, because the research pretty consistently shows that more information leads to more unhappiness. Greater options, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">people having more options now in their life, there\u2019s a degree to which that\u2019s useful, but more so, the more options you have, the more pressure you feel. Happiness doesn\u2019t go up. Once basic necessities are met, happiness does not go up with increased options. It doesn\u2019t go up when you win the lottery. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">It all creates extra pressure and extra stress and an expectation that you will, because you now have all this other stuff with information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: You should be right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Right, and then you just feel unhappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: I\u2019m doing it wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: So the, you know, figuring out how to put boundaries on it for yourself, because yeah, if you miss the Twitter trend, it\u2019s actually not going to have any impact on your happiness. If you don\u2019t keep up with your Facebook status, it\u2019s not actually going to get in the way of much. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">for very few people are those things important. If your job isn\u2019t social media, you should probably know both those things. For the rest of us, we\u2019re probably better off ignoring it for the most part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: And so, but it\u2019s really hard to do because it\u2019s everywhere. And so, you know, making the act of choice to cut those things out or create boundaries around them for yourself to a place where you feel like it is enhancing your life rather than detracting from and creating an extra expectation <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">or a stress. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that absolutely, like the world hasn\u2019t changed, it\u2019s just our being bombarded by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, again, status updates on the world much more frequently than we need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: Which can also be very depressing when it\u2019s actually bad news or something tragic happens. But you know, along with the whole uncertainty piece, I\u2019m not sure where my career is going at this point. Is it going this way or this way or this way? Am I part of a company, or independent, or all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">things? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">And I understand that this is, I have more control over this than I may think, but at the same time, I mean, I\u2019ve often been paralyzed by options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s, you\u2019re very normal in that respect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, even when you go out to dinner, it\u2019s like, yeah, there are some of the things that look good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Right, and the pressure to choose the menu item that\u2019s going to make you the happiest, rather than so, one way to help with that, because you know, there are some ways that you can limit your options, but for the most part, you know, living the kind of life you lead, you\u2019re going to be bombarded <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201251\">with having too many choices. So switching the mindset to not what\u2019s the best choice or, you know, for career, you don\u2019t have to pick the best career path. You have to pick a career path that\u2019s going to make you happy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">Not happiest, not happier than all the other ones, just happy, and you know, when you go out to dinner, picking a choice that you think is going to taste good. If there was another, you know, the thing that paralyzes you is when you choose the item and you think that\u2019s probably going to taste good, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201271\">and then you look, and then you see, well that item might also taste really good and would it be better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">If it\u2019s good enough, if the other one would have been good enough, that\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: Or if you get that one, and it\u2019s not very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Then get the other one the next time. Right, but then saying, \u201cWell, okay, that\u2019s not actually the end of the world. I\u2019ll probably go out to dinner again.\u201d And just changing the expectation for ourself that we always have to pick the absolute best choice for every choice we\u2019re given. We actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">just need to choose something that\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s exactly what the, what happens when I\u2019m writing the songs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">It\u2019s like, I want the best phrase for this, and not having any choice. It\u2019s got to be the best phrase, and I\u2019m moving away from that. I\u2019m like, this is shit. This is just going to be in there now because I need to get here. I\u2019ll go back. But (inaudible at 00:38:29).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: Yeah, allowing yourself to move on with something that\u2019s good enough. Maybe it\u2019s just good enough for now. You know, we were talking about Legos the other day, a perfect Lego analogy. You know, it\u2019s really easy to build a set the first time you take it out of the box, because all of the little <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">pieces are right there, they\u2019re in their numbered bags, everything happens really neat. My littler one likes to rebuild the sets again and again, but of course, everything just gets thrown together in the giant Lego bin, and so I\u2019ve taught him, you know, when you\u2019re making a plane with four hundred <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201332\">and seventy-seven pieces, and you need, you know, a two by four square, it doesn\u2019t have to be the color that\u2019s in the book. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561857\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">We need the right size and shape. It doesn\u2019t have to be the right color. And sometimes, you know, a piece you want a certain piece to be a certain color if it\u2019s on the outside, or whatever, if you\u2019re making an ambulance, it\u2019s got to be red, but he can do a placeholder, and that allows him, right, instead <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201351\">of having a huge meltdown and not being able to build the thing at all because we\u2019re stuck looking for the whatever, he can put in a placeholder. It\u2019s like your phrase. It\u2019s good enough for now because I need to move on, and then if something better pops up, you can replace it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">I think that\u2019s a really nice metaphor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: It sounds like you\u2019ve got some deep experience with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I have a lot of Lego experience, but it\u2019s a good metaphor for what you\u2019re, and I think one of the reasons I give you those little stories is because when you\u2019re thinking about it in a complex, you know, adult world of career choices, it seems so complicated, and when you think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B1\">Lego building, it\u2019s so straightforward, why you just move on, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: This bin of options right in front of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Right, too many choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: You could put four two by ones in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: You could, but sometimes just being able to stand apart from it and saying like yeah, it\u2019s the same concept, just being moved along to a little bit more of a significant decision in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s actually been helpful. I appreciate it. It\u2019s, I think it\u2019s this sense that, failure\u2019s imminent and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: That makes it really scary to make a choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can\u2019t make the wrong decision. And I think sometimes it\u2019s a matter of knowing that putting so much pressure on the decision that what is somebody going to think of this? And it doesn\u2019t make sense, and that\u2019s not good and that\u2019s going to reflect back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">Well, lately with the songwriting especially, you know what? I\u2019m just going to act as if no one ever will hear this. That might actually be the case, but how am I going to go (inaudible at 00:41:12) if that is, if I think about it that way. If no one knows what I had for dinner, if that was the case, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B1\">but I think living this life that I am okay with it, as opposed to not living the life for fear that it might not be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">Anyway, (pause) so what do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: About which piece?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: About Soda Stream being a company on settlement plans?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: I have no thoughts about it to share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: None?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: None.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: I\u2019m kind of struck by it. I guess, it\u2019s a great product and I like it. I don\u2019t agree with settlements, illegal settlements, but what are you going to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Sometimes you don\u2019t have to think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: Often I don\u2019t, I just keep adding more bubbles. Blares out, you know, drowns out the noise of the thinking. Well I know you\u2019re behind, so I\u2019m going to let you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t need to be responsible for catching me up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">CLIENT: I know, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: Well our regular time next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: You need a pen for that or are you all\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: I think I have one.
