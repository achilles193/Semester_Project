it had to do with the memory of my phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. I accidently had me (ph?). So we talked last Thursday right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Did you have a good week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah it was funny I had to talk to my dad on Thursday night about this whole money thing. I left here and I talked to him and I was pretty surprised he wasn't actually able to come up with any money, actually. It's really surprising, wow, and I ended up having to go to my mom who was able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">float me some money. I guess my dad's pay cycle or something goes a certain way and he gets a large payment at the beginning of every month or something, I don't know when, like the first week so...I think on Thursday this week he seemed to put in a good bit of money into my account but it was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">bizarre to have to call mom and hear him say that, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I think that's what they call \"the plot thickens?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose, yeah. It didn't even really seem questionable to me that if I just pressed him on it he'd be able to, you know? Yeah, yeah...which was a little weird cause on the one hand I was like \"Oh damn, I really wish that didn't happen,\" and on the other hand it kind of left me in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">scenario that I was on some strange level telling you I was kind of hoping would happen, you know, that he actually wouldn't be able to help me through with it, you know? This happened to me after I left here, I called him right when I (inaudible)...wow. And it was weird, you know, it was just strange <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">actually, it's some kind of lid in this idea that you know, (pause) if things ever got bad enough I could just lean on my dad or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I'd hope that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Just take care of everything. You know what I mean? It was just really interesting to have that conversation with him and just hear him be like \"No I don't actually, I can't do that right now,\" which really surprised me I guess I just never thought there was like a limit to, you know, his ability <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">to just fix something if he had to, you know what I mean? It was weird in that sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Well and just saying it also it goes beyond that to not paying what he owed you. How he agreed to...Not to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Not a criticism but it's more like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah...but no I hear the element of, not to, there's an element there that you had this, \"My dad will always be able to come through, what's...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: You know what I imagined that scenario of him not coming through, I only ever kind of thought of it as like a willful, kind of refusal to see the importance of (inaudible), he never...he literally wouldn't actually have to means to do so which was odd in itself but (pause) it meant then that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">if I didn't get off the phone with my dad then I'd have to try and figure out what I would do until my dad could get me this money.  I had to call my...really the only other person I could call was my mother, you know, which I did and initially I broached the topic with her, I just said \"Dad's going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">to be paying me all this money but he can't pay me right now, can you float me just like a little bit of money, just to get me through rent, then I'll pay it all back to you.\" She kind of like reacted with a really kind of...I knew this would happen which is why I didn't want to even have to call her, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D3\">she sort of reacted with a very (pause), like catastrophasizing (ph?) sort of reaction, you know what I mean? Really she kind of started to (pause) say these \"Oh, maybe you should be talking to dad, you should be doing this together and stuff...\" and I was just like \"Mom, I don't want to like get into <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D4\">a conversation with you about my relationship with dad, just like I don't want to get in a conversation with you about your relationship...(laughs), like I just need a little thingy, I just need to get me through something and lets not try to bring in every single (inaudible) related topic to do with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D5\">our family.\" You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099639\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: \"I don't want to be calling you right now, I'm sure you don't want to be hearing this conversation so let's...hopefully we can just do the minimum that we have to do,\" and live another day type thing.  She ended up just going off about this stuff and she just kept saying \"You need to get on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">top of your money,\" and this and that and blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Really? To you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah and I ended up just hanging up on her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Huh...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It was just not something I had room for, you know what I mean, I was just trying to figure out my own way just to try and get through this and sort this out by tomorrow, you know and my mother was just trying to make it about so many things that I just had no ability to engage with, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Okay...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: So I hung up with her, or on her, and (pause) you know I kind of went home and sort of relaxed for a little bit, but I ended up talking with her and she ended up, a little bit later I spoke with her, she called a couple of times and I just didn't answer and eventually we got on the phone and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">she was a lot more calm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Laney and I ended up driving down to Cheshire and she gave me a check and I gave her a check and told her when she could cash it and (pause) we had a really interesting conversation where I spoke with my mom alone for a little bit and she...I could tell she was really like flustered by this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">whole thing and she basically was saying to me and sort of subtlety and sort of indirectly that what she was really concerned about was the fact that apparently she had had a really bad history with like relying on my dad for money when she needed to, this is what she was alluding to and she had never <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">really alluded to before. She was basically saying though that I had called her, I explained to her what happened with my dad that she...it just invoked in her mind her own experience with how unreliable he had been with her. Look at how many times she had found herself between a rock and a hard place <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200413\">because he didn't come through when he was supposed to or something.  Which...(pause) surprised me to hear her saying (pause) but it was helpful to hear on some level because it took her sort of crazed reaction to this thing and took it away from what I had initially understood it to be, which was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200414\">a condemnation of me for some reason, which is what I hung up with her, on her on the phone and redirected her concern and craze or whatever towards my dad, you know what I mean, which was a lot easier for me to have a conversation about and (pause) it was funny because you kind of had, like I was sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200415\">here last week and I was talking with you and I was saying like \"Oh, I kind of want to like call my mom and like talk to my mom about this and like bond with my mom...\" and in a weird, odd way that's kind of like what happened. She shared something with me that she never really had before (pause) and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200416\">sort of supported some of these things that I had going on in my head and (pause)...  Yeah, it kind of felt, I don't know, it kind of felt good just I guess because we were just sort of talking, calling a spade a spade or something, you know what I mean? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099639\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. It felt very kind of taboo we even as my mom and I were saying it, we were talking about something that shouldn't be spoken about or something but it was in very kind of concealed language but she was basically just saying \"Your dad has not been good with money with me and I'm really concerned <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">to see that maybe that is happening with you.\" She was basically saying \"I would not want you finding yourself in the place I found myself in with your dad,\" (pause) which I didn't have any trouble hearing, a lot of times I had a really hard time talking with my mom about this stuff, you know what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">mean? I just don't like getting into...any time my mother tries to discuss anything to do with this kind of realm of thought it's...often time I find myself getting very kind of guarded and I want to push it away or whatever, but I was very comfortable taking that for some reason, I don't know why. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200453\"> I guess because there is a lot of upset feelings but it just seemed very honestly directed towards something that made a lot of sense to me at the moment, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I'm probably going to try to find something else, I don't know if I'm going to keep doing this with my dad.  (pause) Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">is too bad in a way because I just would have stayed at the restaurant, I'd have been a lot better off I had stayed there, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah you might have been able to wait tables?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah if I don't (inaudible) to doing that, that would have been pretty good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: It's weird cause that kind of pisses me off but...

You had to phone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">him? And then the plot starts to shift as you called him \"What's going on?\" and then the alert from your mom \"Wait this money thing is not...everything's not cool with the money.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: And also in this way in which I think that this story in a way kind of transforms for you from like...from your standpoint \"I have this impression of my dad, is totally able to manage it, that I can count on him to bail me out if I need to, everything's kind of cool, might have just slipped <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">his mind\" to something very, very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099639\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.  Yeah. I mean one of the big different things with my mom, without going into any details, basically saying that my dad was not reliable, like she didn't say this but the fact of what she was communicating was he constantly didn't follow through with certain agreements about money in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">past. Many, many times which it was odd how much I was happy to hear that, which felt really weird to me because I'd never kind of had a snag around like sitting there, face to face with my mom talking to her about anything to do with our family, I didn't just want to walk away from, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: But (pause) that felt really good to hear cause it seemed like, I was thinking to myself like \"Yeah, why...\" and mom even put it as like \"These are things I've never shared with you, I would never want to share with you...\" and in my mind I was like \"Why wouldn't you want to share that? I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">like you should.\" I feel like that's...those are the things that have been sort of not communicated to me, such that, or that I knew were there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: It's the absence of those or without my access to them, left me like having to act in this way that is completely different than what I understand is...you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Like those are the things that created this massive disconnect, like once I actually had a minimal awareness of them I was just like this is a lot easier for me now. I don't feel so, like my legs are cut off or something, you know what I mean? I just remember thinking that I actually would appreciate <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">more of that. I can actually engage in this stuff on my own terms a little bit more, you know what I mean? Maybe I can understand while like at the time, we were all living together or something but (pause) yeah, I don't know, it seemed helpful at the moment. If I had known that stuff maybe I wouldn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A52\">have had this grandiose illusion that would've led me into this situation right now. That would have been really helpful. (laughs) That being one of a million ways that it would probably benefit, you know, but yeah I kind of want to say that to him, like really want to talk about some of this stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A53\">with me sometimes, let's talk about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.

I can see where she's coming from, like I need to be thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A92\">more about family and stuff, I kind of want to say to her \"It's funny because this last week I've been enjoying my life and done nothing but think about every step I take, my family, you and my dad, literally every single thing I do, I'm glad I'm able to do it in a way you don't realize, my goals not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A93\">to put that on you but...\" It's not like I'm not thinking about this stuff, do you know what I mean?

See if it's even on his mind, you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">what I mean?  It's sort of determining everything that I had to go through.

Right after we got off the phone Thursday night he sent me a text like \"Oh I think I found a better deal on these flights, you sent me...I googled this,\" or something, right after we got off the phone, I was like \"I need to try to figure out and do this.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD3\">He just kind of shot me this text that was just about something, he just kind of moved right on to the next thing and that was technically our last interaction which I just didn't even respond to, not out of indignation at the moment I just couldn't. I had to figure out the money thing... (over talking) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD4\">but even sense I've had to, since I got it figured out over the weekend part of me was like \"Oh maybe I should follow up on that stuff,\" but I just talked to myself like \"No, I'm not going to do that,\" I spent a lot of time last week looking at the flights.  \"This is his thing to figure out. I'm not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD5\">going to...\" Like I don't want to go to the wedding, I don't want to be there. I'm going out of a courtesy for my dad and a courtesy for my sister, you know what I mean? I just...I don't even want to bring myself to the computer to spend any more time researching that.

(pause) I felt bad for him. I really felt bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F92\">for him and even when I was talking with my mom (pause) she kept qualifying like everything she was not even really saying but alluding to with \"Don't share with your dad that I'm telling you this because your Dad's very proud.

That's just not what you do, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: I felt horrible for doing that but I had to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Okay, okay, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: So unlike (laughs) him, it made me feel a little...you know what I mean? I feel somewhat justified being like \"You should share in this a little bit,\" or something. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: That's an important facet I think that I hadn't understood about it for you, both during their I imagine separation and divorce and everything but also still this kind of almost a feeling as if you kind of...you kept what was going on between you and your dad between you and your dad and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">what's going on between you and your mom between you and your mom and not crossing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: So the feeling \"If I do that that's going to really upset the apple cart,\" so to speak?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, absolutely it's going to introduce some kind of tension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: Some kind of tension...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: Upsets the whole system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Okay, okay. I realize we're running short on time but I wanted to kind of just ask you what you felt about...one thing was that I realized that you said that the call with your dad happened right after here and it kind of left me wondering how did that...how did our talk, especially what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B1\">happened at the end, kind of impact you, what did you notice? It's not to say that we can't talk about it down the road we surely can but I was just curious...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: (pause) I felt...after the conversation with my dad I just felt very like, maybe even a little like disassociated from it. I felt very kind of (pause) like numb in terms of feeling like angry or confused, I felt very, just kind of floating along. I didn't...I don't know, it was a really weird feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: With me, when you were...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: No you didn't...I left here and I went and called my dad. I didn't really even think much. I was pretty calm leaving here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Well I thought there was this important kind of awareness of \"Yeah where's my enthusiasm,\" and kind of interest in what you were experiencing and then we started to talk about it and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: You mean how do I feel that that carried in to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: No not even necessarily that you carried in, I don't even...I guess I kind of wondered how that left you feeling? I ended up feeling that was a...at least what I felt like was I guess a pretty important aspect of it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20156-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20156-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099639\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">CLIENT: I was really glad that we spoke about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">THERAPIST: You were?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.

Interesting, okay. I thought it was very important, we were just starting to get into it and then we stopped and obviously then right after, the phone call...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">THERAPIST: And your dad and then it kind of switched...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">CLIENT: That's kind of what I had gotten in to, yeah.

I guess I just kind of wondered how and in what way it fit in, if it didn't, just to not even have to answer today but just \"Wow, that was a...\"  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: To be completely honest with you it didn't come into my mind so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.

I got to say just to share that I was wondering if your dad was going to...was having trouble with money or something? Not trouble but just <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201771\">not being able to pay you? It's kind of...let's see he's kind of acting a little cagey about it, you know, prior to you saying \"Hey where's my money?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">CLIENT: Mm hm. It never occurred to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">THERAPIST: I can see that. And obviously you know your father much better and have a sense...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">CLIENT: Well I think that's all for today, that sucks (laughter), that's what I'm reacting to here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Right, yeah that's a long ways.
