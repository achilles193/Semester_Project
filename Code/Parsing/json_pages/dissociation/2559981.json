Did that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: No, I knew what time it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: But as it happens it's exactly less convenient now that we've switched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Mm.

Either that or I would have got my act together earlier. But I would have been able to leave to take my bike back and then leave for a family reunion sooner <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">or easier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Because I might have a three fifteen on Wednesday if that works any better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, that sounds kind of cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Let me get back to you next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Yeah. Someone who is fundamentally just a coward really and devises all sorts of narratives to sort of obscure that fact. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Hm. What's the act? Is there one that you have in mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: The act?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Who? June?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: June, right, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: I was just wondering if you meant <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think I just pick fights. It's like I said, she's fixated on negative things and complaining, and I'm fixated on picking a fight. I mean she like gave me her whole schedule, like via text message. I just said, \"How's your work,\" and she gave me a weeklong schedule in exactum, or some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200991\">Latin word. (laughs) Like she gave me the exact schedule. It's like twenty lines long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">And so it would be like, \"Huh, well, it looks like you have time here.\" I somehow turned the conversation into like a I just doubt her authenticity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: I brought it to a place where, you know, she said, \"I'm only thinking now.\" So our day comes up and I'm like, huh, maybe she wants to do something or maybe I can get her to do something. So I pose and then she says, \"I can't. I have work.\" And then I call her out on that and she says, \"Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F1\">you're right. I want to but I can't.\" Or, \"I want to but school is more important.\" Law school. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">And so then I just, I said something weird like Not weird but something I meant but which isn't really productive, which is just like, \"At some point you're going to have to stop pushing me away.\" And I said, \"I'm fine with being a friend.\" Which is true -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">CLIENT: in this case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">CLIENT: But at some point you're going to have stop pushing me away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">CLIENT: And then I said Oh yeah, I said, \"You know, losing you to these listless alibis is almost like the Hamptons is gone forever,\" or something like that. Because we connected on that point about our childhoods on the Hamptons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Oh. Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">CLIENT: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">THERAPIST: That's a good way to put that. It's poetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B5\">CLIENT: I'm glad you think so. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yes. (laughs) It's very poetic. I was just thinking that's very I wonder what she thought of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, I mean, the obvious approach I think I'm fundamentally ambivalent about intimacy with women. I think I might be terrified of them on some level. Or more the fact that, at a certain level it's (inaudible at 00:10:39) anxiety. Like I won't be able to control myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BD\">CLIENT: Or I won't be able to check myself. Or more, I guess, just that I'll be hurt beyond measure and there is nothing I'll be able to do about it. I think that's what you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C1\">CLIENT: Like if you've been hurt before -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559981\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: you just try and prevent that in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: I think that's counterproductive in my case. I recognize that just recognizing the fact isn't enough to change things really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Well, I think, I mean there's the ambivalence, I think. I mean, you've fallen for women in the past and you felt very burned by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">THERAPIST: I mean, certainly you want that and you don't want to be burned though.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, at what point though is it also you feel you end up being like you're not going to stick your neck out either.

Because, I mean, I've had thousands of sexual experiences and most of them involve porn. And it makes me wonder, well there is like a manipulation inherent in that genre, where like everything is staged just to It's sexual manipulation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD1\">basically. It's a manipulation of man's animal instinct. And so I wonder whether I sort of react to that as well without realizing it. You know?

It's like an escape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">CLIENT: But it always involves pornography. It's like I get like a little tingle in my head or my gut, and I need satisfaction instantly. And it's available instantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. Is there something about it being like a way that you can kind of be a bit self-sufficient given that you've got pornography as an outlet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">CLIENT: Can you rephrase that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. Do you end up feeling like, \"Well, why stick my \" In other words, and this is an over simplification, but like, \"Why stick my neck out sexually if I can just, you know, jerk off to porn and get some of my needs satisfied.\" Yeah, it's not the real deal. You know, is that? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200F31\">then it makes you less kind of motivated to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">CLIENT: Absolutely. It's a check on my emotions which would be much more difficult to manage otherwise. It may be not be clear the way I'm phrasing, but it's like a credit to me. It's leverage against -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">CLIENT: Against women.

It's like if someone couldn't help from going to the circus all the time. I know you would probably turn out kind of weird.

I used to I tried to stay away from it before when I was younger because I recognize that it turned the opposite sex into a sexual object, and would make it difficult to see them in another light. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559981\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: Just like if I read up on body language, that's what I'm going to see.

It's still, it's something I need help with. I don't know what to do about it. Because it's not so much, I think with any addiction, it's not the effects of the substance itself, it's the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201111\">fact that you can't control yourself that is detrimental.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: Or that you I mean, yeah, everything stems from that.
