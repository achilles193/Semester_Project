Is that a is it some like variation of ice tea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: It's just Darwin's right here. They do they'll have different kinds.

You know where it is right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, let's see. (pause) Looks like the hands of a mechanic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: I clean things so. (long pause) There's something that smells like mold in my living room. Or I don't know if it's foot smell or mold. Like it could be my new roommate's like feet. It smells like foot smell. But it could be that she has stinky feet. Or it may be the mold attached to this couch <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">that was in the cellar before we raised it up to the third floor with pulleys. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. The landlord and I get along okay now. There was this issue when you know of material when I brought home six bikes and sort of placed them all in the backyard. I've been fixing one bike every two days, but keeps but his feeling was that you know I couldn't just throw the bikes back <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">there. And that they were technically storage and that they have to be he had granted me a storage area in the basement for such purpose, even though I you know, the storage area's always been there. And he bought the property after I had lived there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: And in fact to he sort of abrogated the whole rear of the property for his own use. But he was saying you know, I don't have a problem with you working there. I was working there at like a Saturday night like one to five a.m., or something like that. One of his snarking friends came up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">like fell down the stairs when he saw me, or something, I don't know why. But he fell down the stairs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">But he said I don't have a problem with you working there, but you know you can't store the bikes back there. And you know I was I changed the subject and then I don't know. It's some sort of you know, sort of prodding to see what it was that was the problem. You know are they an eye sore or because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">I don't like someone telling me what I can and can't do. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559969\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Well you know it's like they got something going. He had also sort of like when I started enjoying playing music, he was like stop playing music. And it's like that Bob Marley song, every time I plant a seed, the guy says kill it before it grows. You know I'm starting to play and he just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">jumps on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: But I decided to compromise because which I don't think I'd done before really. Because I needed to be able to work in the back. And he could he wouldn't be able to stop me from working in the back of the property late at night. I had set up sort of a flood light on the third story, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">lit the back area. But he wouldn't be able to stop me from working there, but he would be able to make it uncomfortable. And it just wasn't worth it for me to have it be uncomfortable every time I see the guy like passing by while I'm working on the bike you know. So I ended up moving the bicycles. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">Oh and plus it rained, so that simplified things. It's like it's it's not very good of me to keep people's bikes that I'm fixing outside when it's raining or just all other stuff. So that made it kind of easier, but I still I left them out in the rain one day just to spite him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Hum. What I mean to you, what when you know, when he said hey, you know don't store them there. What did it kind of bring up for you? Like you telling him he basically saying you've got to do this for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wasn't very pleased. (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what is that? Yeah. (pause) It almost I mean it almost sounded to me like a slap in the face kind of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I mean like he could throw his junk around where ever and I have to and you know he can tell me what to do. I don't think so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Like I kind of almost a pow like I don't know if power's the right word, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Well yeah. Yeah he's the fat cat. I don't you know on top of it I feel like there's something there that we we've could dig in and find. But also -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I'd add that you know I was it was one of those really hot days when this happened. Like it was you know probably the hottest day. I just it was around 5:00 on a Sunday. He had called me once on that it was June 3rd actually. He'd called once in the morning, but I was at church, so I didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">answer. And then I got home and I took a shower and I was just I just went out on my bed and like conked out. And then it's like a knock and I don't know, it's just like incorporated into my dream. There was like a knock and then I turn around and the landlord's at my window. (laugh) And like he wakes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B2\">me up and he's like, Jeeze. He's like go to the, you know to the door or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">So I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Not delicate about this huh? Or tactful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Exactly. Right. I got up from the bed I don't know. Let me see I get dressed rather simply and opened the door. And so he was wondering where the rent was because it was the 3rd. You know never mind that I'm still really mad at him because he's been away. And so and that Saturday I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">he wasn't away. I didn't say anything, it's just that my other roommate, she she hadn't been around much and also she hadn't given me the rent. So I wanted to talk to her before I talked to the landlord. Because I paid the rent for the unit. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559969\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">And but apparently she had spoken with the landlord and she didn't want to get like, didn't want us to incur fees or get in trouble because she didn't have the money. So she was embarrassed to talk to me, but she talked to the landlord. So he was working on something with her. So he was wondering <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">where the money was and he said so can you give me a check now. And I said no. And he said well when can you get it to me? And I said I'll give it to you tomorrow. And he's like well I'd like to go to the bank tomorrow morning, can you know, can you get it to me for that time? I said no, I'll put it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">in there around 10:00. And yeah, we probably checked at last. Oh yeah the fridge, had a problem with the fridge which leaks a little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">About his friend who fell down the stairs and said yeah that's when he first talked about the bikes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: And I was like okay, your friend, he fell down the stairs. And I told him about these pigeons. Did I tell you about the pigeons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: The pigeons. The pigeons. Third floor. So the guy next door, he let pigeons roost in his balcony. There are two balconies out there. One on the front and one on the back. He let pigeons roost in his balcony last year and so they laid their eggs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: And so this year there are like 10 or 20 came back to the neighborhood and like try to find places to roost. So you know I'd be reading in my room or on the computer or whatever, I'd hear the like rruurr, rruurr, making mating sounds, pigeon mating sounds, like urrruu. And like I'd open the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">window and like throw hammers at them and stuff. And like (laugh) but they keep coming back and then <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Not playing cupid with those those pigeons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Not at all. They don't take a hint. And I got those little pop caps for the pop guns that you like shoot and you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah, uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: They go bang, bang. And I had this little thing I got for Christmas, one of those useless things that you drop them and there's a pop cap on the tip and so it makes a bang. So that scared them away some. But they kept coming back and then I found two eggs, I just threw them out on the asphalt. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">And they stopped coming pretty much. But occasionally they still come up there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">So I got these Alka Seltzer tablets which apparently they make pigeons like blow up if they eat them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I've heard that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: So I get the berry flavored ones. I think it's a myth, but I figured it will make them sick at least. Yeah. So I was talking to him about that too. But then he was telling me to move these bikes. And I'm saying well, you know I'm not really you know I'm not sure I you know maybe it's just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">that I I just woke up, or I think I might have said you know maybe it's just that you you woke me up from my nap. But I'm not sure how I feel about you know, being told to move these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: And he's like well you don't have to like it, Brandon, but you know I I'm in charge and he turns around and walks away.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559969\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I didn't I just and he's like thanks I appreciate it. I hate when people say that, thanks, after they tell you to do something. I was like you can appreciate whatever you want. It was just one of those stupid things you say. You can appreciate whatever you want Fergus. (laugh) Because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">had no intention of like moving them you know. Ha, ha. And like I said I did leave them out an extra day in the rain just to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Just to kind of like yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Fuck you. (laugh) Stupid people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: But it did make sense to bring them inside. And we've since had some sort of I mean I don't want to have to sort of like an opinion of me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: But I talked to the guy I guess oh yeah, but I was working on the bike and so a couple of the tablets for the pigeons had rolled off of the balcony onto the back asphalt area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: A couple of the tablets?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: The Alka Seltzer tablets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: For the pigeons, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: You had just sort of laid them up there and they had and they fell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: And a couple of them rolled off. So I just sort of scattered them. And I got two generic bottles. And so you know, I was working like the next night, or the night after about 3:00 a.m. And like the flood lights on, and I'm working on the bike, just truing the wheel I think, the spokes and whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">And out of the darkness comes a skunk. And it's like it like starts like meandering towards me in that skunk way and it starts chewing up one of the Alka Seltzer tablets. (laugh) I like listen and there's another one like five feet away and it's eating these things and my plan is backfiring big time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">because like the skunk is right next to me and it's eating these like indigestion tablets. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">So I just sort of froze and then when it seems reasonable I sort of walked away and came back five minutes later and the skunk was gone, but there was a skunk episode. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Hum. It didn't blow up huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: No, it didn't blow up but it was a strange stinking though. (pause) Yeah I tried to get this Vancouver trip going with my cousins. Like my sister's up in Vancouver, or she was. I think she's coming back here to work for the summer. But she had been planning to stay up there. And so I checked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">with four guys like my cousins via e-mail and just say, let's go to Vancouver and so like a weekend. And so I made a Google spreadsheet and people could check in when they could when they wanted to go. I talked to I guess three three beforehand so that I see there's just one good guy but she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B52\">in Oregon. And she said that she one weekend if it got rescheduled so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">It's sort of like (pause) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: (long pause) Yeah. Well, I sent out an e-mail to 14 people I think. And then the 15 just like send out to two other friends maybe. And one of my cousins responded like why don't we change can we just eliminate weekdays? But I'd included weekdays because I planned on going there with a friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">who was attending a physics conference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">So I don't know, me and Ashley sent out like 15 people or whatever and I don't know whether I should respond and say, well actually I did know what I was going to do. But it's a it's a tricky thing when you send out a mass e-mail and then someone else sends out a response like trying to correct or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">optimize your e-mail. And you're like well do you shoot this person down because you've already thought it through or do you, you know try to go with them for the sake of cohesiveness. Because you didn't want like a little issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559969\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Right. And for most people they're going to be receiving it with the issue. Not like what you sent. Which is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: But does it spoil it a little bit for you? Like does it feel a little bit spoiled?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Though like it's your time, she kind of goes why didn't you eliminate the weekdays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: (long pause) I don't know. I it spoils it but far as I know the message won't be as effective. It's <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: I mean, it's just I don't know. (long pause) But yeah the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: I ended up correcting the guy and he was just like well this is the time, actually I had three people that said that this is based on you know, going with a friend anyway. And so if anyone happened to be able to go it would be nice. But then it makes it sound like it's about me and you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">it's sort of centered around my schedule, the other 15 people might feel like. Then someone else suggested the cousin I had talked to from Oregon said like well I'm going to be coming home this weekend, but I don't know if I can cross I can go that far, even though she lives in Maine. So how about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D12\">we meet in Western Connecticut on this weekend. And then one person said that's a good idea and nobody else responded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">Then someone else said like oh, what is it, it's like Vancouver's too far and something like very neat, like very pedestrian like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: But they're fucking up the plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's the thing it's the idea isn't like to make it convenient for everyone. The idea is to like bring the family to a new place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Apart from the older generation. And experience some of the some adult life. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: For God's sakes, like Baltimore would work just as well I think. But <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Like Baltimore City?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Right. I mean there are things to do. It's the society, it's the it's not the same the same people, the same places, doing you know the joyful things and stuff. Yeah so basically I'll just salvage who I can and probably go up for the Vancouver jazz fest. My cousin Kylie though, I guess she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">doesn't have a passport. It's kind of sneaky of I mean that, the cousin that I went dancing with, when she brought her boyfriend and all that, that was Kylie. I guess a major motivation is to try to get her involved as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: But I'm really like so round about like that. Like I was I went with two friends to the Ramen place in the Square. Have you heard of that place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Now which one do you to, Asahi or the other one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: I've been to both. The other one's a better one though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: The one in, what's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: It has a long name like, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: It just has one dish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: Okay, so we went to the other one, but the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Asahi?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. We went to Asahi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Asahi's good yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200FC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559969\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: There was a line there too, so (pause) Yeah, but I went with two friends and there was like an Asian girl next to us and or woman I guess and like she was with a guy who was kind of shy. But she started a conversation with me and duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. And then she started talking to her <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF1\">possible boyfriend and then she was talking to me and possible boyfriend and like she it came up in her conversation with her boyfriend that she was from Chicago. So I brought it up in our conversation that I had an uncle in Chicago who had just invited me to stay with him. But really I should have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF2\">taken that to her. It's the same toying with like with Kylie and this like play with me Kyle. I think I'm sort of indirect in those situations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: I'm viewing this like kind of unfixable problem. I just I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: I do need to fix it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: Hum. Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: I'm a little too sneaky to think about like you know I was talking to them about something that I wanted to say to her. I had an uncle who lives in the Watergate, so so you too (laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you should just stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: No, I think I just said I'll see you soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Oh, I'll see you soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh and she was it seemed like she was trying to brag unnecessarily. She was saying shooting like the economists. And she was like oh this guy this guy this isn't as good as my paper which I wrote a year ago. But see my roommate dated in that situation I recognized that the guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">might be her boyfriend and so I used that as an excuse not to press things, even though she was quite attractive and apparently somewhat interested. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: But I probably should have pressed things irregardless. I mean if he needs to stand up for himself, let him stand up for himself. But he seemed kind of laid back. Maybe it's just an old flame. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah I probably should try the other Raman place. Is that one in the complex? Like we couldn't find it really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: No, it's not in the complex. It's do you know where the pizza place is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: I've seen the signs but I don't know where it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: If you're going towards Clarendon, it's on the right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: Um-hum. That's helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, but indirect you know what the way that feels though to be like kind of going around the bend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: Well it didn't work so. (laugh) So no I don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: It's just Oh God yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't think it has worked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Well it sounds a little bit like you're conflicted between being sneaky or being direct and kind of too like pushy or something. You feel like you'd be too you know stepping on toes. I don't know. I don't know if that's how you feel about Kylie as much, but. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: I don't know. (long pause) Yeah I do feel like I don't take what's available. Like I need to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Especially with young women, I mean it's irrecoverable. (drumming on the chair or something)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: Hum. Yeah what about Kylie? What do you what have you been thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: Well I mean I'm thinking that this you know 33 year old engineer is probably you know, fucking her and so It's not going to be the same. I mean even now or even the last time I saw her, she seemed different. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559969\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: Huh. How old is she?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: God, she's probably 21. (pause) (drumming on the chair or something and making music noises) I'm not just talking about with Kylie, I'll join up with anybody, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: Or I'm like yeah because I guess you could say anybody can have pretty changes, but (long pause) (chuckle) Yes and my cousin Edgar, the same one who was like creating issues about Vancouver schedule or whatever, can't remember the whole thing. He texted me and asked me if I'm going to be in <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F1\">for Dungeons and Dragons tonight. Which I find pretty unenjoyable. I play to connect with my cousins, but it's really, it's not just that connection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">CLIENT: And it's I don't know. I mean I if I had almost anything else to do, I'd probably want to do that. I mean I want to watch Mad Men rather than do that. I mean if it rains I plan to go over to the meeting house and ask that girl there . I'll just asking if she would ride shuttle for a while. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201431\">Yeah sort of (pause) yeah I don't know what to do. I just like know, I don't care. (laugh) I just you know I don't really want to play. It's (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah it seems like a contrast from going to Vancouver and seeing well how did you put it? Seeing some of the world?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">THERAPIST: Being out in the world, being -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">CLIENT: That's right, yeah. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">THERAPIST: What do you think I mean are your cousins, you know you talked about how your cousins or how your family can feel such a comfortable place but also kind of like an Eden like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">THERAPIST: Are your cousins a bit like reluctant to leave the kind of paradise behind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">CLIENT: This cousin, he amazes me. It's the same guy I moved in with to get out of living at home. It wasn't ideal. I felt like I still had some stuff to figure out with my parents. Something about our relationship but I decided to move in with him to move out of the home. Stop my mom from driving me crazy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">CLIENT: But I moved in with him. Then he brought a girlfriend in. And I said why don't you two move out. And then he moved to Western Connecticut. His girlfriend left. And now he's moving into his family's old house. Not living with his family, but his moving into his old house with his brother. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201571\">yeah, he was five years older than me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">I visited my other cousin visited yesterday which was nice, but we didn't have much to do, just the two of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: So imagine you're .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: I get the sense that he's you know condescends towards me or doesn't respect my way of life, but which is sometimes like no way of life, so. (chuckle) But so he came over anyway and we played like an old video game. And he's like I think his family pushes him along very set lines. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: And you know he does what they want. So not since he has it both ways, but he has. He's still sort of in a struggle with his family. But he's also making progress. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: What did I it sounds like you're describing somebody who's not a full not as individuated as -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: No. Funny it's very dated that so no offensive plays seem like a very good puns. Other things seem he has an imagination, loves to tell stories. Tell stories about his dreams which are sometimes implausible. But he's he's an engineer and he's sort of like, well I sort of watch him getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201651\">deader and deader.

But that shouldn't suggest that like I'm thinking you know you guys are too gummed up, like we need to do something else. My thought is my cousins are my connection. But I now know that I can't continue to like tread water in this comfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B1\">family situation.

He seems sort of similar to me in a couple of ways. And the same thing with Edgar though or with oh, I guess that's it, well this one other guy. But it's just like you get something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C91\">going and my life otherwise is kind of just not so much sure anymore, but it's it has been at times pretty lonely and isolated. So I guess I get excited when some sort of natural conversation or interchange develops. But I was just trying to get you to blink really.

I kind of sometimes find myself thinking about with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D\">Like how the mother sees something of real talent and like interest in their child that they can deliver something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020F\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20211\">THERAPIST: But it's it's true, it's in the child but it's also something for the mother's benefit.
