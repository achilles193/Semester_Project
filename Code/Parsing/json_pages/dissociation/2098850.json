I don't know if it was meaningful or familiar that helped it stick a little better that's helping you remember it and that made it clear that you liked it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">CLIENT: Sounds like a possibility. Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Has there been anything else like that in the last week or so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B5\">CLIENT: (Pause) No, not really. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B7\">THERAPIST: And how's your memory for less recent events like visiting with your family over Christmas or... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B9\">CLIENT: Not great. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Do you remember being there at all if not the specific?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BD\">CLIENT: Not really.

(inaudible at 00:18:34).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C5\">CLIENT: Not really, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Graduating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C9\">CLIENT: No. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200CB\">THERAPIST: How do you feel as we're talking? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200CD\">CLIENT: A little anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Do you know what's making you anxious? My hunch is sort of this feeling that something is different, something's wrong like processes of your memory. In other words it's kind of disconcerting not to be able to remember all these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D3\">THERAPIST: And I'm asking you a lot about it otherwise you probably wouldn't be thinking about it so much. So sort of focusing on something you're having trouble with like this is disconcerting, and I can imagine it's making you anxious. Does that seem reasonable? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah? (Pause) I imagine it may show up like being at home where things are a bit more familiar where you're doing stuff, there's stuff to do; reading, or putting meals together, or talking with James about things. That sort of structure is probably helpful now whereas coming in here what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200D71\">you talk about is quite open ended and it's a lot about remembering things sort of foregrounds what you're having trouble with. I don't think it's a bad thing. It doesn't sound like it's usually disturbing from what I gather, but I imagine this was making you feel a little more anxious at the moment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yes. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Do you have any questions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200E1\">CLIENT: No. (Pause) I probably ought to. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Do you have any feeling about coming here now like you want to, or don't, or sort of whatever like how most things are? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200E5\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:22:34). Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Do you know if you've had any particular ups or downs over the last few days? My impression is probably not, but have you had periods where you felt really bad or really good? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200E9\">CLIENT: No, not in particular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200EB\">THERAPIST: It's been pretty even?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200EF\">THERAPIST: And like this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200F3\">THERAPIST: And you still feel like you can read?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200F5\">CLIENT: I'm sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You still feel like you can read?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098850\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Good. I believe you can. I'm not saying that like (inaudible at 00:24:02). I mean more like sometimes when people when cognitive function is effected it can get difficult to read like to concentrate and sort of stay with what you're reading. But I'm very glad that that's not happening to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.
