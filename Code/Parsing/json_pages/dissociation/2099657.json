I should (inaudible); I said basically \"if you want to invite me to like a dinner or something that would be good.\" When <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">the time came around I didn't really want to go, didn't want to face this (pause) pseudo without like a very established occupation or therapist and I felt like really embarrassed. In other words in some way I felt like I'd be handicapping...that's not what I want to say but what I want to say is in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">some way it's sort of a comparison to me meeting this guy for my sister.  On a more official level I wanted to establish a superior relationship or like a...you know?

Like I'm not concerned with how he judges me, I'm concerned with how the work (inaudible) goes and how it would set a foundation for future interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I see.

Capilano in Vancouver.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Okay, I understand. And her boyfriend is with her at school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well he just moved here from Rome so I don't know what he's doing but he's moving to Vancouver. I don't think he has a job, I don't know. Yeah I also told you I've been using my brother's car and my brother came back from college so he should have his car so I have to give the car to him but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">I don't want to meet the family.  I was also wrestling with this because I was like going to a church event with people my own age so like a Catholic western, we had a movie night, so I was at that and right after that I (inaudible) to the dinner (inaudible) which is like a farm place, they grow their <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">own food, it's a really good restaurant. But I was aware of a couple things, I was aware I didn't want to go because of like personal developments that feel like interacting with my family and also I met with this sort of...what I (inaudible) past last night, I won't say that but like a compulsive...I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F3\">wouldn't go out to eat. For lent I've given up going out to eat during the week but I went out to eat Friday night at an Indian place, so I decided on Sunday I just wouldn't go out to eat.  So that makes it two...so I didn't go but I had to get the car back to my brother so I took it out in (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F4\">and I went home and was going to have him drive me home but while I was there my sister and her boyfriend came home so I decided just to stay but...it went okay. I wasn't terribly impressed with the guy, I mean I guess there's a little language barrier but he, he's good looking but he's not terribly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F5\">polite and this politeness doesn't really require language. I suspect she's more interested in him than he is in her or he's...got intimidated at the last dinner I missed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099657\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: You found him impolite then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, not rude but not much excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah especially for someone whose five years older than her he...I don't know.

(pause) Did you feel like he was bringing up some sort of feelings about what your station in life is now? Was that it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I mean I had a plan in mind but (clears throat)...(laughs) not especially, it comes to mind but it's nothing groundbreaking. What I've had sort of folding with these...aside from what I told you, that I had hoped to talk about was sort of opposition in relationships that I've been feeling.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: What have you noticed? Opposition?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Well I think I either care about someone very much or the relationship is what it feels like...but if I care about someone the relationship seems to go sour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It's frustrating. I feel like I defer to much or it doesn't work and I'm wondering why that is or whether it needs to be that way.

I feel like I have a plan that I have to follow through with but also I put off doing whatever is important always and stick to much easier, more changeable tasks, doing laundry or going to the grocery store. You know I have a plan <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">to...yeah I don't even want to talk about it cause I don't want to jinx it but I know what I want to do, I know what would be positive to do but when it comes down to it, I don't know, it's easier to jack off or get a lunch or fool around with friends at Cambridge, it's easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it's anything like the whole thing \"if I get to interested in it, it's going to sour?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I wonder. Probably, like it's a risky prospect. I don't just casually apply, I don't get these people that like send out a hundred applications, I just, if I want to work somewhere, I want to do something then I do that. So with a job, if I want to get the job I work at it, there's a chance <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">I might not be accepted or might be for not.

That's not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: It was connected, yes. It was, I don't know if that's something...yeah maybe I internalize that, I don't know.

Or anything, any sustained commitment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Well I guess I do have one other thing to say is that I think he felt like there was something that you didn't get from your family, maybe from your mother and your father in ways that you've kind of...you can't elaborate in here but you felt like the hope you were going to get from here... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">(clears throat).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Or maybe I used to get it but after Lawrenceville I didn't and...but like you said it's also possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You feel like you did get it?

(pause)  Yeah honestly I feel like I can't provide everything for you. I did (inaudible) and I totally expected to, for it to even sound like that when it might be from behind. But yeah, fourteen or fifteen, whenever it was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: You wanted to leave them behind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: The independence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: That wasn't the appeal, the appeal was like political power or really that's crude scripture but you know ascendance, social ascendance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah it's some sort of failure to launch, sort of went back to my family I think sooner or later. So like cause I don't know how to relate to them or they don't know how to relate to me at that time but I don't know how to relate to them now and anyway besides some sort of dependent or...yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">But I think while I was away doing other things my parents didn't know how to relate to me or what I hoped to do. Just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yes, what did you not...what was happening? What do you mean by \"yeah?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: They weren't able to connect to me or you know what I (inaudible) not know, but it just didn't register, I've just gotten out of (inaudible) the last savory aspects of an elite boarding school education.  I guess it is but...so it's sort of understandable but they while I was separated they <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">didn't register it, they didn't...and worst of all I went through an episode where I sort of had a terrible term paper and I got a great grade, not a great grade but I felt a decent grade on it and it was shit and that morning when I brought it in the papers were all over the place and only the first <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200872\">page, first page and a half was any good and the parents were there. My mom said after that she said \"We're so proud of you,\" and it was the most (pause) alien...just like the most disgusting comment I've heard, ever. It was objective, (laughs) there's no way I could describe it because it was so far <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200873\">from the way I was feeling about myself, if they were proud of me or if she was proud of me that's...you know, that's reprehensive to me as well.  Just no connection to her. I do think on some level, I guess my mother was sort of complicit because she was encouraging me to go there and I wanted to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200874\">there but for her part it seems like she was aware of the fact that she could put me in an elite institution and when I graduated it's like people want the end and you get something, you get opportunities, you get all that and she didn't care about anything in between. They pay your tens of thousands <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200875\">of dollars and you get results and it's like an exchange relationship I wasn't on board with.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099657\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Sounds like a sausage crying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah it's something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You don't care about the ugliness in the middle?

She didn't really have a sense of what you were really, what your experience was like at Lawrenceville. I guess embodied really in the story of that term paper where you felt it was a piece of crap, you handed it in, there must have been a lot happening for you around the term <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">paper and you already, you invited a feeling or thinking, something about the school is already having a hold on you and yet what do you hear at the end of all that? \"Good job.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: \"We're proud of you.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: \"We're proud of you,\" is just sort of rised (ph?) her theory when she said it but it wasn't connected (noise)...yeah I closed out. After the first weekend at Lawrenceville, the first time I was sort of crying to my mother because she...I realized that families, like their kids grow up and they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">become distinct individuals and that's not like a one solid indivisible unit anymore, that it composes certain parts of the family. So I was pretty sad about that. My mother wanted me to tell her what was wrong and blah, blah, blah but I couldn't really describe much and after that I resolved to keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">stuff to myself. So many years later I'm trying to explain that I haven't been happy for some time, they just don't understand, it's like \"Your grades were fine,\" or \"Your grades were fine...\" The work I was doing for NASA's (laughs), I hadn't thought, yeah, I didn't try to (inaudible) I wasn't even <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200973\">able to because I was very depressed, even if I wanted to it was quite an effort so... I showed up, most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Well maybe the case is that something was happening and it's not that you didn't completely understand about how to communicate or articulate to them (clears throat) or felt like you couldn't try to make sense of it with them. Something was happening and it's something that was hard to put...maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">you do have a really good sense of what it was (clears throat) (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: I guess having such a strong family, I wasn't very exposed to other types of interactions. (pause) My manipulative relationships really affect the way, they also sort of fall short, rather they terminate like (inaudible) said that you know, things have always have to be my way and I can see <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">how that's like, you know, she asks for a kiss or whatever, I don't feel like it, I don't give her a kiss and (laughs) it's always when I want things done that they happen.  I'm not entirely cooperative. But it's not like I feel more content stuck in these manipulative relationships than actually caring <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B2\">about somebody and I shouldn't say actually but to keep from caring about somebody and then I sort of fall on my face. (pause) You're (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099657\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I always have a couple things to say but usually I forget them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I just had the thought did you...were you feeling anything as I was asking you about the Lawrenceville experience, I mean I noticed that you went to the Cleo (sp?) and I was thinking was it like too much of my own agenda or something like that? Or it felt to you like I was trying to press you too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: No, that's not why. I couldn't explain with any sort of conscious calculation. It didn't work right, explain the connection between Cleo and the Lawrenceville...my experience did not sync. But not to jerk the conversation... (laughs) in another direction, not really another motivation story. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">Not really. We're sort of getting awareness, sort of cut short that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah and not that's anything...it shouldn't be (noise) about that, what you said about Cleo and this accusation that you try to control things or something and in some way maybe like it felt like I was getting too...my agenda was too much and I started to wonder that as we were talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">what your feeling...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: It's good I...that seems like different stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: But also when you first speak up, it's all about me. When your speaking, I was thinking I actually control and it's interesting that you are taking objection to that because in the past I've had or people have...my old boss said I had trouble with boundaries and so it seems like...boundaries. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\"> It seems ironic or oppositional, I don't know. On one hand if I, it seems like I can't win in some way or like I don't care, that's the way it is and that's (inaudible), like that's just how it is so...but yeah I'd rather look at Seth asking me for control too much then (pause) attacking me for like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">a nebulous sense of interaction (laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Other than crossing some sort of boundary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah well Tracy would say that, she would say something like you don't have a sense of (inaudible).

Or in this society. I feel like the legislative system is not equivalent, like if I can live the same (inaudible), I'm going to go away for more time. I feel like the whole rape situation is really uncomfortable because I'm someone who when I went to college, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB2\">the first week was dedicated to making people aware of sticky situations and alcohol and I was told, not informed but told that if there's alcohol involved and you know, we had sex and the girl said the next day it's not okay then that's rape. That's just kind of absurd, what I said at that time was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB3\">it seems like you should put the emphasis on drinking alcohol or the decision to drink alcohol instead of holding me accountable for someone else's decision while their drunk. How is it automatically my fault if we get together and everything seems consensual and then that's where I go, you know, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB4\">was drunk.

I don't understand.\" I said, \"So you've made a decision to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">move out and you are trying to build up a reason list, that's what this is about right?\" and she just pretends not to understand but that's exactly what it is.

I can't, like I feel in control with a relationship and its good, but I can't control the desire, not the desire but the practice of viewing pornography and jacking off, like two nice girls came over and I really had a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">great time with them but after they left and we didn't do anything physically, after they left I was just like, I felt great and then I put that energy into watching porn and jacking off, it's like I can't shake the sex drive, it's like...I don't know, I have no grasp on it and it just drains me of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F2\">energy, it changes how I see people in a physical way, I guess I'm getting more comfortable with that but the fact (inaudible) completely there and yeah, I don't have energy, I don't think it's really a more tentative and bitter though, it's probably not directly related to...maybe none of its directly <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F3\">related to jacking off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: How much do you masturbate? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: It depends, like if expect real sex then I won't do it but if I've been waiting for real sex for two weeks I'll do it and if it's more than two weeks and if I don't expect anything I'll probably do it, like watch porn and then jerk, three times a week or something. Mostly against my will I think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">I think pornography is a terrible thing. I mean there's like one or two good videos ever (laughs), as I've seen online but for the most part it's the fact of watching somebody else having sex is not morally reprehensible but not in any way useful and (pause) I'm trying to think this out...It's a vicarious <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201232\">experience that's...if it's not harmful it's definitely not beneficial, something about the disconnect between physical pleasure and physical contact or physical pleasure and satisfying another person or physical ability and physical need and physical experience...that's still not there.  There's a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201233\">profound disconnect that I feel like pornography exploits, it's not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: So it's not that it's a matter of how much or how often, more that what it's like when you do it?

I mean other people I describe as aversion to it, might find it laughable, like the few friends I've talked to this about, they think I'm somewhat out of the middle ages or something but I don't think it's positive influence in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201431\">my life at all and whether I create the problem, it's something I've tried stopping and I've had no Segway, no power to regulate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. Yeah and it sounds like you find it upsetting you or kind of your ability to think as clearly as you liked afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can't connect with people as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: Connect with people, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: Like talking to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: It must mean an awful lot to you, I wonder what all this means (laughter). No really, you know, there's something... And you found yourself wanting to do this the other night when these two girls came over?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Do something physical or masturbate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: You wanted to masturbate when they left? Was that the...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: I didn't want to but it happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: It happened. Okay, yeah. You did masturbate when they left?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah, I felt great after they left, I was like...although yeah I guess I was, I would have pursued sexual avenues, it was one of those caring things where I care and I was...it was weird, they were 21 and I'm 25 but I'm looking to one of them to...I don't know, maybe I don't have enough experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201571\">with many people but I don't get the responsiveness like I think maybe I have to push a little, be more assertive because I was looking to her, to one of them to see where she was at and gauge that but really as a man you have to throw it on the table what you want and then they can say yes or no and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201572\">then that's how it works. It doesn't work like seeking some sort of acceptance or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">CLIENT: If it becomes the option you take it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: I guess it must, I would imagine...it reminded me of those questions of what you can do and what you can't do and do you have to be cautious and how...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah cause I don't want to jeopardize what the relationship is, as is stands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: Right, right, and the caring? How does the caring kind of fold in with wanting to be assertive sexually in some way, how does...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: Wanting it to progress sexually, yeah. It's weird, maybe I've said this before but I think that sex is only appealing to me in that it like calms, pretty bad actually, it cultivates much more in fantasy, it's like it's a reliable way to establish a relationship in some way and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: It does bring people closer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: I think that's one of the...I guess you kind of wonder if that's a (inaudible) in the diabolical sense or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah for me it has to be.
