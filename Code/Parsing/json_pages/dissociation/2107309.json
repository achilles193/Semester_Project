Thank you. (Pause twenty seconds). So I feel pretty weary this morning. (Pause four seconds, client exhales) It was a fine trip. I think. (Pause six seconds) I think it was productive for me. But they're offering a three month contract, (pause five seconds) so I'm trying to nail them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">down to some kind of commitment, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I think it's just a budget thing, but I'm obviously concerned that, concerned about the prospect of finding out that on the other end there's not budget to renew. Because working on three month contracts is, it's not a great situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Well it plays right into so much we've talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And the complexity is that on, you know, ultimately I think Kevin has to defer to his chief of staff, I can't lobby him directly for all kinds of reasons, you know, among them just are ethics reasons. So (pause six seconds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Kevin's your (inaudible 00:02:00, voices overlapping) who's in charge? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Kevin's the guy who's in charge. So (pause five seconds), you know, I asked Jack to talk to him and it didn't seem like that moved anything which, you know, on one level kind of hurts my feelings, but on a more practical level it's just a shitty situation to be in. I really (client sighs), I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">don't want to have to stay in this position at (inaudible at 00:02:35), it's not good for me. As well as not being really productive, but right now I'm kind of facing the prospect of asking them, asking Phil basically, if I can stay in this somewhat, you know, in this nebulous role for another three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">months.  (Pause five seconds) I mean it runs out in June in any case. I sense it's kind of a dead letter. Or not a dead letter but, you know, it's not that consequential. Anyway, I feel homeless. I feel, I feel really valueless. I feel kind of hurt and I feel exhausted, just like exhausted and I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">know how much harder I can try to find some kind of place. Homeless. (Pause seven seconds) So I'm not sure quite what the next step is, or rather I do know what the next step is, it's to apply for more jobs. I feel exhausted by that prospect.  (Pause ten seconds) And the other piece I guess is that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B4\">in some ways, the only thing that made this tolerable, or I felt that the only thing that made this tolerable is having Jack on the other end kind of advocating for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (Pause eleven seconds) Anxiety was so crushing otherwise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: (Pause seven seconds) You mean if you had been dealing with somebody who you didn't know and have the relationship as you do with Jack<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: That you would have been unbearably anxious? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And I think the other piece of it, I guess, is that, you know, I thought that beyond Jack I did have, I had people who would, you know, kind of advocate for my best interests, or at least keep them in mind and it appears that I don't. (Pause fourteen seconds) I just, I don't feel like I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">too much, you know? Am I really (pause four seconds), I don't know, I feel very timid. There's a (whispers) oh God (pause ten seconds, client blows nose). Anyway, I just feel really tired. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107309\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: (Pause twenty-nine seconds, clears throat) Umm (pause fourteen seconds), you don't quite frame it this way but, which I think it is interesting and quite important, but I think you're sort of reeling from a blow.  You focus on kind of where it's left you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: In talking about the future, having to do things that seem overwhelming like looking for another job or staying on at this job, you know feeling exhausted. (Pause seven seconds) In a way, a little bit from this very specific event which is, you know, what they offered you was not what you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">wanted and I think not what you thought they were going to offer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: It's not. I mean, obviously I was proposing to leave a job and start another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: You know that was not what we negotiated and I feel like, you know, yet again, you know this just feels like this succession of blatant (ph?) switches.  Ultimately, I mean ultimately I guess I have to take some responsibility for it in the sense that, you know, if you rely on your network for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">your employment this probably is, you know, more prone to happening. (Pause six seconds) You know if you apply through traditional channels<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh I see, like (inaudible at 00:08:45, voices overlapping)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: which I found very, you know it's like I did this once, I went through one cycle of job applications but it was, I was so demoralized I guess in some sense by the kind of machinations that seem to be, you know, the outcome of those applications that I tried a different strategy and that different <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">strategy has  Whatever the role, you know whatever the distribution of culpability is, that strategy has come to this pass. You know, the end point of that strategy is where I am right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: (Pause one minute eighteen seconds) I guess what I'm trying, again, I umm.  (Pause thirty-three seconds) I guess I could put it like this (pause five seconds), you know when 11:40? cursed me for what happened and it's like you got punched in the face. And (pause five seconds) it kind of is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">like (clears throat) uh, you know this happened I put myself in situations where I could get punched in the face and it fucking hurts and now I have to figure out what to do about it and how to clean myself up and what to do next. And, talking about the situation in which that (inaudible at 00:12:11) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">you in a way, but I get the, the piece I feel is kind of importantly left out is the piece about this guy punched you in the face, you know.  (Pause three seconds) I guess you seem to be moving away from the need, feelings in a way that are sort of tied up in the situation that happened. Like, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">totally let you down and at least based on how you were talking before you meant, I imagine it surprised you really? It caught you off guard, and you're really angry at them. I imagine you feel much less securely connected to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes. Certainly the latter. I don't know, I don't know, I can't detect anger. I feel disappointment, I feel hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: (Pause five seconds) I mean I guess it was never explicitly stated that I was negotiating with Jack, you know, who I knew but didn't have ultimate decision making power.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107309\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Whatever was or wasn't explicitly stated, you had the impression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I was in good faith, I ran it by the boss, I interacted with the sub-boss, and then there was this person that I had never met who apparently is responsible for making the decision who just kind of nixed it. So (client sniffles), angry? I was certainly led to believe that there was going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">be more security than three months. And I do good work! I do good work! I mean, you know, (pause seven seconds, client sighs) there's a history here and I'm aware of that and I have no idea what role that plays in this process, maybe none.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: What are you referring to? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Well, you know, I've been, sort of allowed myself to be recruited to jobs with the person who's now the boss and on several occasions I've just said I can't do this anymore I'm feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: From my point of view it was like I'm feeling too anxious, I feel a sense of anguish that's, you know, that's kind of intolerable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: You know from his point of view it was like well I don't want to do this. And so it's obvious that at some level as a factor, whether directly or indirectly in the sense that he's kind of less willing to go to bat for me when faced with this certain<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah I wondered about that, whether part of what they're doing is okay we'll see how it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Well, you know, that was, so Jack called me yesterday afternoon, late afternoon, and he basically said they don't, because I had said when I went back \u2018listen if I'm going to leave my job I want to at least have a six month commitment'.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: And so he took it to them I guess on Wednesday, and it sounds like the chief of staff said \u2018no, we can't make more than a three month commitment'. And he took it to Kevin and talked with him briefly and kind of told him where I was coming from. It sounded, from the way he described the conversation, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">like it was non-committal, he didn't get a firm statement that. So basically my analysis is that the chief of staff is worried about budgeting, and I'm sure there's lots of expenses for travel and security and all kinds of other things too that all of his. She wasn't involved intimately in the decision <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">making process. in the sense that, you know I kind of did an interview with her all along, so Jack kind of botched that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Frankly, you know, I don't know what role just sort of peak (ph?) and being out of the loop in this decision may have been, but that may well have been part of it. (Pause seven seconds, client exhales) But ultimately what makes it very hard, in this case I think, is that this contact, this old <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">friend and colleague isn't going to bat for me. This person who, you know, probably would have to carry the day ultimately if he said \u2018I really want this', it would happen. And that has to do with this history of abdication. That's my analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: You know, so it's one part actual budget constraints, one part kind of mismanagement of the initiative, and one part history. I don't know what the proportions are, but those are the factors I see at work. And, you know, I feel some anguish that this history which, from my conscious point of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">view at least, whatever the kind of analytical model we've come up with may be of my volition and my agency and all of this, it's not like I was consciously saying \u2018I don't want to do this, I'm blowing you off'.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107309\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Of course, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: I was really, I've really been in very deep distress and I feel, I guess to the extent that I feel angry, the extent that I can call up anger, you know I can call up frustration about the budget situation, I can call up a little bit of, I don't know how to describe how I feel about Jack not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">really handling the management of or not really managing the relationship with the chief of staff very well. I'm not angry about it, Jack is a wonderful person but he's not a great operator so that's just kind of the hand we're dealt. I feel sad, and maybe at some level a bit angry, at the (pause six <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">seconds), you know the kind of blame or accusation that feels implicit in my hypothetical model of where Kevin is coming from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: On the other hand, you know, as a manager you need to go on the basis of track record even with people you know well and you don't want to go to bat for somebody who seems unreliable so I kind of understand that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: I imagine you're worried that, tell me, that ironically the way that contributes to their not wanting to offer you something more long-term will make it difficult for you to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: In just that same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I am. I'm quite worried about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I guess this maybe seems to be one of the main points here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Knowing you're on a three month contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes. I'm quite concerned about this too.

So I guess, you know, I guess at the end of the day that's kind of what's going on. There are moments, even in the last five seconds, where I think to myself, \u2018well, you know, I can do this'. That's fair enough. I think to myself, \u2018that's fair enough. It's not great, but fair enough'. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">And I suggested to Jack is, I said that we write into my terms of reference performance indicators that would eventuate in my renewal. I don't know if he'll go for it, but I proposed to write some language to that effect. And he thought it was a reasonable idea, and so I'm going to do so and send it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F2\">to them this morning. So I'm acting, it's not like I'm totally paralyzed, and yet there's this sense of anguish that alternates with this more proactive, you know sort of settled <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Right, and maybe this<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: coping behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Although I don't quite have my finger on it, is why I think, you know, in a way there's kind of two separate issues here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: One is how you feel you were treated and what the relationship with this institution feels like now, that's one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And two is the reality of the brevity of the contract and figuring out how to deal with the uncertainties that go along with that, and so forth.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: In our discussion today.

So I'm managing that, but I don't think that my response has been to kind of go off into this fairly distorted and clearly not very productive place of just giving myself over to this sense of bereavement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Well that's great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I mean that's what happened over the summer with Phil (sp?) announcing he was leaving, more or less right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: It is I guess, isn't it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I mean that's great if that's not<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: I don't feel like, I don't sense any of it. I feel, I mean I don't feel it's unreasonable, you know assuming that, I think it's a reasonable assumption that at some level what's going on is just sort of the reckoning of this long-term pattern. You can't be outraged by it, I don't feel outraged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Well good, okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: I guess that's good. It did have a protective aspect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: But yes, it's good. (Pause nine seconds) I mean I, what I do have (client sighs), what I do have is a very strong impulse, very strong impulse, to make contact with Kevin directly and basically negotiate some kind of an agreement with him directly to say, \u2018listen, I'm not sure exactly what's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">going on, but I just want to get some kind of assurance from you that A, you basically would like me to come on board, and B, reassurance I guess is more, maybe more apt, and B, that if certain conditions are met I would be able to continue, I would have a place here'. I have a very strong impulse to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D72\">do that. I think that would not be the right thing to do, I think there's a considerable delicacy when you're the head of a large bureaucratic organization about hiring people that you know from before, you know, for these kinds of positions. And that would put everybody in a very tough spot.  I may <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D73\">be wrong about that, but my intuition is that I don't want an e-mail trail establishing that Kevin is making the decision about hiring and firing. There needs to be some insulation there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107309\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: So I have this very strong impulse on the one hand, I have a fantasy at least that not doing, trying to do it through Jack may be taken amiss by somebody that, after all, I know pretty well. But I'm leery of transgressing some kind of local rule and making things worse. But the impulse, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">for our purposes the impulse is kind of interesting because it's kind of classic for me. I mean it's like some kind of, it's like I have this anxiety, I have this deep anxiety about my place and my relationship and where it is and how it is. And I just want some kind of reassurance, I just kind of reach <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB2\">out or I have a strong impulse to reach out for some kind of reassurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Often that attempt, that approach isn't appropriate, often.

And so badly done by in the sense of the outcome's measure not being fulfilled. That's something that's absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: What I'm thinking is that that's the way that that's really a kind of a smaller piece of a bigger puzzle which is more about<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: No question. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: finding a home and feeling<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: No question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: settles somewhere<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: That's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: and wanted and all that.

And it's kind of a reflex response to what we were talking about just now. It's as if there's some kind of transitive property of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">feeling displaced, like I don't really have a home, like (inaudible at 00:32:12) the line, like it will disappear in five minutes and forty-seven seconds. You know this is, in some ways this is what passes for comfort. There's an ease to, you know, knowing I'm sitting in this chair for X (ph?) minutes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201032\"> At least within the parameters of that interaction nobody's going to chase me out, and yet I know that it's time limited. I don't know, I'm rambling a little bit.

I mean if I sat here and refused to leave at eight thirty, it would <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">be inconvenient at least, but that's kind of what I feel like doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: I kind of feel like refusing to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: In Washington, and wherever, I just at this point I just feel like staging a strike, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: (Pause seven seconds) Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: A sit down strike. (Pause six seconds) I don't know why, I don't know why these people can't understand what's really going on, you know it's just wanting a place that is, I mean not just wanting a place but wanting a place that is, I don't know that is, so here's the kind of entitlement speaking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">that's worthy of me.  You know not just a place where I make arrangements, but a place that does justice to my creative and other competencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: So maybe the hard done by part is creeping back in a little bit.

Not having an appropriate place maybe, where one should be? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: Okay.

Maybe things aren't made for people. Maybe they're made for some people and not for other people. I guess that's an unfairness.

You know in part I'm kind of rehearsing this sort of or persephorating (ph?) on it maybe because I have to talk to Phil (sp?) today, basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">CLIENT: And kind of tell him which way I'm going. And at some level, I guess, I feel like trying to work out a deal between us where<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: You're not out altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: I'm not out altogether. Which would mean, among other things, just sort of serving some program assistant functions since my salary prevents, since it's my salary it can't be somebody else's salary, if you know what I'm saying. You know there's no room for a program assistant salary if my salary <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F1\">is still being paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: Anyway (client sighs), where's the clock?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: A couple minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20166-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20166-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107309\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: I talk about it explicitly more than I used to, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: The clock? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. My usual MO has been to test you in various ways. It's an imbalance that you can see that I can't I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah I used to have two clocks, but they haven't given me another one. It's not for a clinical reason that I don't, it's more of a (inaudible at 00:44:05) reason, they didn't think to buy a clock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: Okay. I guess I find the tension kind of interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: It's hard to find a clock that doesn't tick that has a continuous movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: It doesn't make a ticking noise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: It wouldn't make, if it had a continuous movement it would make a ticking noise. Although sometimes if it's like a plug-in electric it will have a buzz, which is probably just as bad or worse. So, yeah, I don't know where that leaves me but I am kind of trying to figure out how to handle it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B1\">with Phil. And my impulse right now is just to say fuck it! This is it, I'm done and I'll deal with this three month thing, you know the salary is high enough that it will presumable give me enough leeway to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">THERAPIST: You know for what it's worth, I mean, (inaudible at 00:45:05) you're like \u2018I haven't decided', I'm like \u2018Really, you have to let Phil (sp?) know today?'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">THERAPIST: Because he's always so good about letting you know (therapist chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">CLIENT: No, it happens that we have a couple of meetings today anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">CLIENT: No he called me on Monday just to kind of see what was up and where we were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">THERAPIST: I can see him wanting to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">CLIENT: I put him off and I said, you know we have to work things out and I'll let you know later in the week, so I do feel like I need to at least settle things. And I've been telling him January first all along so, in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: Now we have to decide where our January first is at.
