I don't want to You know what I mean? But then we did. I was like; you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">know what? Let's just the three of us We can work on parts and it was great.  Worked on a I had this song that I hadn't played for them, whatever, and we the three of us did it and it came out really nice, and worked on some harmonies and more specific kind of (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Ranging<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, ranging, right because it's not as loud. So it was nice. I'm glad. That was good. (Pause) But I noticed, maybe it is because of the holidays, but I noticed that I'm drinking a lot more. There's always something. I don't drink at home. So, and I was like, maybe that's what I've been sleeping <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">a little more wacky too. Alcohol just throws you off. We had the holiday party two nights ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Who, your company?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) We had Sam Adams and their beer is just fucking awful.  But it was a lot of drinking. Yeah, I've just been hanging out more with friends and stuff. I don't know. So, yeah, it's the holidays. It's hard not to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What does more actually mean to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Like almost every night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: How much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Well, I can drink. Well actually no, I shouldn't say that. Last night, actually no What am I saying? Last night, the guys were drinking at practice, and I didn't. I had the medium coffee with me, and then I had two after. So that's not But at the holiday party, it was shitty beer, and probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">had at least six. Normally, I mean, I can put back the drinks. If there's a nice cold beer I like light beer. If there's something cold, and not disgusting, then I can put them back.  But that's the thing though. Lately I'm finding out whatever, I'm betting older-But lately, I'm finding that even <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">when I don't have six. (Laughing) If I have two or three, then depending on how I feel, then it's just kind of like, yeah. Not really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: What? Like, how you feel the next day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I'm just not enjoying Like it's just not going down as easy.

Yeah, I don't think I've had quite that many. Even when I go out lately, I don't think I have six. I think now it's like four. Is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Four or five?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, four or five. It depends on where I am and what I'm drinking.  If I'm somewhere where I'm comfortable, it's like a place I hang out, so I For example, there's a bar in the Square. I just know they have really cold beer cans and I love that. I don't know why. It's one of my favorites. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">It's just like soda pop. They're ice cold, and they're you know. So I just get more you know, it's that environment and so, I can put them back. But otherwise, I probably don't probably not six, like four maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098472\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Every night that amount?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: No, no, no, it used to be.

But it's only lately I realize; whoa, it's been pretty much every <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">night for like the last week or two. Because Dave and I if we work in the studio, we'll have maybe two while we're working. So (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a change from earlier in the semester-some?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I haven't been and the other thing is all my friends drink, and they can all put them back the way I We're all similar that way, so it's But, I've not been going out as much. Yeah, so It'd be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">like maybe once, or twice and then maybe if I hang out with my friends Donnie and Lila at their house, maybe once a week or whatever, or every other week, then we could put it back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Which can make it hard if you're a part of you is thinking I don't want to do that all the time, if everyone you know is doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Can make it hard why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Hard not to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, yeah, no.

And then the next day, I think to drink water, but I probably don't drink enough at all.  So it's like that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: But even that night, you won't come home and drink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: No, that night, I will come home and have some water, but it's probably not enough. I'll just have a bottle, and I'll be sipping from it, but yeah, yeah. And then usually what will happen is, I'll either wake up at night, or really early in the morning, and then just chug now because I'm feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">crappy.

So, sometimes, if I'm really feeling in the mood, and I'm I've had a big dinner, and I'm all good, whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">I'd like one whisky on the rocks, just to enjoy it, and then I'll just go right to the Buds.

Drink more water and not drink as much in general. And, it also feels like it's a place where you're harder on yourself than you necessarily have to be at the same time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">You know, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, It's hasn't been bothering me. It's doesn't not like it used to. In the past I was drinking too much. I just noticed that this past week because my (Overlapping Voices) sleep has been a little -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: (Overlapping Voices) that it's been crazy,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I was like; Oh, I wonder if it's just plus I'm taking medication and shit.

(Long Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: So, alcohol even the scene of alcohol means you're going to bed later too.

I won't stay up. Yeah, yeah, I'll get home like at For example, I'll go to Donnie and Lila's, we go to their house early, so I'm usually home by ten or something, but I'm pretty buzzed. So those nights usually, I'm asleep by <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">midnight because I'll just get in bed-as I'm watching a little TV I'm out. But, yeah, other times, Like last night, I had two so when I got home, I was up. I wasn't It doesn't really make me sleep early a lot of times.

I don't care how unconventional my You know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">I mean? There might be some times where if I'm finishing a project, or if I'm in the middle of writing that's different. But overall, there's no fucking reason to be up after like two, one-thirty, two, there's no reason to be up past that.  So that's the only issue is that sometimes it becomes it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">kind of pushes the boundary a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: But it's such a trend to stay there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that's why I was thinking about it, because lately that's what's been happening.

It's all cold outside, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">and you're like cozy. It's like I enjoy it. It's like I enjoy it's peaceful and quiet and I'm watching a movie. It's nice.

(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it is hard to just close your eyes and be alone.

The thing is when I do go to bed Let's say I go to bed at midnight or one. It's not I still have a radio on or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, yeah.

No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I mean I've heard you say you often fall asleep with the TV on, but you're saying it feels like you have to the TV or the radio has to be on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Or else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: I'm sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Or else what happens?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: I'm restless, I can't just (Pause) I don't know. Probably nothing happens. I think at this point I probably could just lay there until I fall asleep, but it's just a habit. I like listening to a podcast or something. Because that way I don't have to sit there and be like; Okay, I want to fall <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">asleep. I find that it I don't think. So next thing I know, I'm asleep. (Laughing) It kind of works out. Whereas, I don't know, just laying there, waiting to fall Some of it is also I just know myself. Some people can just fucking put their head anywhere and they are out. I'm not like that. I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B12\">sleep on buses, planes, trains, whatever. I'm just up. I can't just suddenly be out.  And the same with sleeping, I can't just lay there and be like; Okay, give me five minutes and I'll be asleep. It doesn't work like that. I don't think it'd be that bad. I probably just would fall asleep, but I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B13\">know. It's just a habit. (Pause) I mean, I think One think I will say though is that I think it'd be easier now with the cat. Because she's so curled up next to me that I think maybe it would (Laughing) be like It kind of gives my mind because I'm usually just playing with her ear or there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B14\">something there, so I don't have to maybe think as much.

I just enjoy <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">that. But (Pause) yeah, that's funny though. Yeah, with a woman, it's usually not an issue. (Pause) Although, the one difference though of course, is usually nine out of ten times, if there's a woman, that means we had sex. So, you definitely sleep (Laughing) a lot better. It's a lot of physical you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C52\">know. So in some ways it feels really nice to just drift right off to sleep.  It's a little bit (Pause) but even still, there's just something nice. That's actually funny. I never really thought about that. Because I am more a lot of guys aren't cuddly or whatever the word is.

I was actually just thinking about I'm like; alright, I'm going to see Kelly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">tonight. (Pause) It probably will go nice, whatever, and we'll have sex or whatever, but and yet in this moment, or yesterday, today, whatever, I feel kind of yucky.  You know, I just I feel a little(Pause) not hypochondriacal or whatever, but I do feel a little I am a little bit focused on <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201092\">bodily sensations.

I mean, to me that it fits right in with what we're talking about; that your body has always been the familiar zone of expressing something, whether it's sex, whether it's a symptom, that the body is speaking something that you aren't maybe don't have words for yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2010A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098472\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: I guess that's true, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I mean, you said about alcohol, for example, then you don't alcohol and sex, you don't get to think. You don't have to think. That there this bodily expression is an expression of something without having to think about it too much. Like a psychosomatic symptom, (Overlapping Voices) it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F1\">(inaudible at ) in the body, but if we start to sort of pull it up, what's it really about. If we as I think about it, usually the actual symptom starts to fade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">CLIENT: (Overlapping Voices) Yeah, that's true actually. Right, that's true. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: You could be drinking more because you're thinking more (inaudible at ).

I don't drink at home. (Pause) So it's I mean, I think it's more that I'm maybe socializing a little bit more. And that's part of it too, like I'm just maybe I want to be out with people, kind of change my mood or change you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201151\">know. So that's just part yeah. But yeah, maybe it's just part of the all the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">THERAPIST: Or maybe that's something healthy that you're actually (Overlapping Voices) wanting to get out and be social.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: (Overlapping Voices) Yeah, over I think that part is healthy. I think maybe it's just the while I'm out, it's just kind of like; Oh, this is a that nice added distraction, or whatever.  (Pause)  But, yeah, I must be feeling some kind of anxiety a little, because I do this past week, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">I've been having that feeling again of like remember I said I feel like I can't breathe, like I'm not breathing right, or something? I've been feeling that way like all week. It's like one of my least I hate that feeling. It's like I'm just like; why what's happening here? I'm obviously breathing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201192\">but like I'm not getting enough air, or something.

So, then I just end up feeling yucky. I just feel like maybe it's just maybe I'm like so out of shape, or maybe I'm just it turns into something psychosomatic kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: When'd you notice it yesterday?

Yeah, but see the thing is, it happens so often, I've I think I don't even bring it up as much because it's such it's like part of me.  But yeah, it happens often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Where you feel specifically short of breath?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Is it true? I don't know. I just feel like I'm not breathing right. You know? (Pause) Which is the only thing when I'm sleeping with a woman. That's the only thing that does make me uncomfortable. Because very sometime para not paranoid, self-conscious. I'll be like; am I breathing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">loud? You know? Because I'll I'm not sometimes I'll breathe with my mouth open a little bit, and I hate that but sometimes I just feel more comfortable like that.

If I see people doing it I kind of I just don't like it to be a habit. You know? To just to be like breathe through your just have your mouth open, breathe it's a little weird.  So yeah, that's the only thing that sometimes makes me very uncomfortable for a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201311\">while. (inaudible at  I'll be like I'm like; am I breathing too loud? Like, she like she's probably like what the fuck is this guy breathing (Laughing) so loud for? Or yeah, I don't know. It's just yeah, that'll bother me sometimes. Especially if I'm really cuddled, so it's warmer, and I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201312\">do very well with heat. So, I'll be trying to breathe through my nose, but I'll just be feeling hot and kind of but then I'll be like; no I bet if you breathe through your mouth it's going to be loud. I don't know that's one weird thing I have. And then of course, then it makes me start thinking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201313\">Why am I what why do I have this weird issue with breathing? What the fuck is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">THERAPIST: With even I mean it's breathing. Think of how basic that is. How you could feel self-conscious about breathing. It's sad in a way. I'm just thinking about you as a kid somehow. What about your sense of yourself can carry over to the most basic -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">CLIENT: Oh, I guess I never (Laughing) thought of it that way. That's true. Yeah, I'm fucking breathing. Yeah, right.  That's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: Everybody breathes, right? I mean, it's like you can't do anything if you're not breathing, and it makes a little noise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: It's one thing if you have a cold, and then it might but you're saying this has sort of even when things are feeling ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Like this image somehow of your presence getting too loud and big, and somehow a turn off. There's a fantasy of that somehow behind it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, I see what you're saying. I never thought of it that way. It's like yeah, what how could you be hard on yourself for breathing? I think it's yeah, it's just what I do, is I focus on the physical that somehow actually no shit, that's crazy, that I'm somehow (Laughing) I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201411\">I'm even doing that wrong.  You know? It's that thing of like I'm not even breathing the way other people breathe. It's like I'm breathing weird or something. That's crazy, whoa. (Pause) Yeah, that's fucked up. And you know what, that maybe that's I'm I mean, normally what I think is happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201412\">is because a lot of people with anxiety, don't know that they're kind of hyperventilating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: That can happen, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: Because I think what's happening is because I'm trying to breathe more normally, I'm fucking up my breathing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it actually could be happening (Overlapping Voices) Oh, yeah, totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: (Overlapping Voices) Yeah and it does, especially when I'm with a woman.
