It's been a really good 2 weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I'm glad to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I always have a good week or two and then the night before I come to see you. So last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: You should just come see me every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Hopefully not, if that's the way it works. Ok, so last night I went out with a friend of both mine and Josh's who wanted to introduce us to a bunch of her friends she just met. So no one really knew each other, and everyone was kind of awkward, and it ended up being really fun, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">it was sort of I don't know, taxing I think. And so by the end of it I'll go all sort of like, and one of the girls there<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Wait, all sort of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Wound up. And it was a bunch of this girls good at cycling, and it was like a bunch of cycling. I ended up getting into a conversation one girl because she was complaining about not being able to sleep. [0:01:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: She has all the same problems that I do, and I was really excited. So, I don't know. So you know and my friend liked one of the other people there, and wanted us to like gauge the situation better. So the whole thing was like a little dramatic and got me all wound up. I mean you know how I am, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">a little overweight, and I went to bed. I was really happy when I got home, it was really fun, but I was just all wound up and Josh was actually super cranky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: What does wound up? Describe to me what that feels like physically and emotionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Happens to me all the time. I mean I told you when I have dealings with other people, if it's fine it's my own doing I get energized from them. Sometimes it goes over the top.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: So is wound up over the top of energized? Just trying to fully understand what it means for you. [0:02:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don't know, I just get a ton of energy. Like I could go run a marathon afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Is that a good feeling? Or.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah it is, it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Ok, intense but good. Hyper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, hyper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: A kind of gung ho kind of body language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Hyper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Hyper, ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I don't know why this happens. This happens, I think I told you last time, but going on a bike ride with the girls, I don't know I just got really hyper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And you felt like that was overwhelming for her, and Phyllis and Barb.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and then I mean part of the reason I enjoy this other girl I went out with yesterday is because she also is also kind of hyper. When we go on bike rides together, we are just extreme, but match.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well then it's matched, so you don't feel like you're overwhelming somebody else with your. [0:03:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I recognize I will have [inaudible] it's happening. So I did not. I got home and Josh was super cranky because he was tired, and a bunch of girls and he was hungover. He wanted to go sleep, and I was super tired too, but wound up and I made the mistake again of trying to go right to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">sleep and then woke up in the middle of the night like still wound up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah you need your newlit period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah I was a little frustrated because I'm not entirely sure what works.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098412\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah to kind of calm you down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I mean when I had successfully, I was successful at calming myself down once or twice before after going on, I think I told you about one night where I did go right to sleep and then played with the puppy until like late at night. I don't know but I was hoping to have a corrective day today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Right, and? [0:04:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I've just been completely useless today. Feel tired today as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: There's lots of reasons to feel tired today. You woke up last night. The weather is sort of tired inducing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I talked to the other girl actually, and she told me she couldn't go to sleep until super late. She was all wound up too. At least I'm not alone in this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: What happens when you woke up in the middle of the night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I don't know it was almost like I have never gone to sleep my mind was still like hyper kind of going. I mean I do a bunch of work at least it's positive. I did not stay up all night like uncomfortable, but it wasn't that great either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Did you happen to try doing one of the relaxation exercises before you fell asleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: No. I read a little, which seems to work. Although I have a terrible book I'm reading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Switch books. Terrible in that you don't like it, or terrible that it's not relaxing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Ah, both. [0:05:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: It's a book that I was hoping to go to this lecture book club chat thing about it. I don't think I'll go, unless I force myself to read it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: what is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: It's about an MG invasion in the future in country. [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: You need to find a book that's actually pleasurable. Especially if you are using as your kind of transition to try to calm you down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Well until last night it was working pretty well, because I was really tired but relaxing was so boring and I was just reading pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Bored is different than relaxed though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right, if I'm already relaxed it works really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: The work actually relaxed you. [0:06:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I mean nights like that where you have something that ramps you up before you go to sleep, any night really and trying to make a transition into feeling calm and feeling relaxed might be a good time to do some of the breathing exercise we do in here, and the progressive muscle relaxation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">Because it gives you a focus to try and calm your mind down if you're thinking about each body part and tensing and relaxing it. You know take some of the racing thought away because at least part of you is going to be focused on the process. And then it has the physical part of probably deepening your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F2\">breath and slowing things done. Relaxing your muscles, it can help you kind of induce that come down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah I mean I think it would take a long time, and I have a hard time deciding okay I'm just gonna do another hour, it's like relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: It's unlikely that it's gonna take an hour. It is gonna take some time. [0:07:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: But I think you may be overestimating how much time you need to do something like that. When we do it in sessions, we don't give it more than 10 minutes. And I know you're not asleep at the end of that, but you generally do feel more relaxed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: That's true. That's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: So it may be somewhere more than 10 minutes, and the goal isn't necessarily that you'll finish the exercise and be asleep, but that you're relaxed and then able to fall asleep. So you may need to devote more than 10 minutes, but I think an hour is a really high estimate.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098412\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: So I mean this past week I've been feeling more and more like energized. Which is great but that it also makes me also nuts because I cannot blow. A week ago I had just had my class presenting all their projects and they were freaking out left and right, and all kinds of problems. I left class <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">and I was gonna go home. I was just so wound up I just had a need to really go run, which is not, this is like 5 o'clock this month. Something I like to a little bit long time, it's like me please go run. It's 5 o'clock and I usually want to go home and lay down. [0:08:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: What is the feeling behind I need to go run? What were you thinking the run was gonna do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Because the idea of sitting down and relaxing is so unrelaxing like the thought of it is so. Like I just feel wound up but not because I'm doing something, because all that needs to be let out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Feel kind of keyed up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Which is what you told me one of the things. So and I was like well I think this is good because it's what I used to feel like, but this is bad because maybe then it's just anxiety of turning so. I did not get too wrapped up in that. But thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Anxiety doesn't have to be bad. I mean I think what may be a better word for what you're feeling is arousal, which is not as pejorative as anxiety. Anxiety makes me think of bad, and I think that keyed up, hyper feeling that you're talking about is kind of your physiological arousal. [0:09:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: You've get a lot of energy, it's up, your I don't know if we would test your blood pressure right now what it might be. Or your muscle tension, or your heart rate, but there might be signs of arousal going on there. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. You don't have to judge it one way <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">or the other. Maybe what we need to do is figure out how to use it. Like so how do you use that to be energy and motivation for exciting things? How do we harness it? Kind of push it in the direction to help you rather than get in the way, you know of sleeping. How do you discharge it when it's not useful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Well<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Did you run?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was kind of helpful yeah. Yeah time was really good. I mean it was confusing because I did not get home until like a little later. I don't know it's not something that I have until I really, really [inaudible] [0:10:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah confusing because it's not typical, you don't know what to do with it right now. That seemed to work, going for a run was felt good. It's nice to know you can still do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yup. So I don't know. I don't know what's going on lately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: I think you have more energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah I've always wondered if like because I get so heartburn I get really tired, like I just use up all my energy like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah I think we need to kind of figure out how to kind of contain it when it can be contained, and use it at will rather than feeling like you have no control over it. Because it sounds like right now it feels like you don't know exactly what's going to get you really keyed up, and you don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">know what to do with it when you feel that way.

It's just really only a problem at night. Coming home from something like last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And not knowing how to calm down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and not doing the best job handling it. And I mean I cannot remember this happening to me, like in college. Maybe it did I just did not notice. I would notice or care if it was just one night after randomly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: But know you care so much because you've seen how disastrous it could be when this isn't just one night.

Ah she has been sort of. She's got sort of like a girl-guy like, or the guy whose a girl leading on her, but because she according to my friend will not admit that she is gay. But keeps asking my friend out, and my friend reciprocates, and freaks out at her. It sounds like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">there could be serious problems with this girl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Not your friend, but the<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah my friend is deluded. One of them is deluded. [0:13:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Either my friend or the other girl. Interesting though you know, who is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: So that's what you're thinking which one of them is crazy here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah my friend is totally like, so and trying to like let it go because she thinks the other girl is deluded and doesn't want to like waste her time, yet so I've handled it because what happened to me with a little twist. And it's in the world of lacrosse which is a special group of people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">or even strangers and regular people. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">The situation was just not [inaudible]. [0:14:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So 2 things. Let's think about what can you do to help calm your thoughts? And what can you do to calm your body? So remember that sheet I gave you with all the lists of ways of thinking? What could you use to alter what you were thinking, just to kind of shut it down for the night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: And at that point nothing was about me. It was about her and just the excitement of it all. I'm not sure I could change my, I don't know how I would change my thoughts to stop, and I'm like [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: When would you<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: So it was all physical at that point too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And I agree. I imagine that they are linked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.[0:15:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So I wonder if just sort of acknowledging that this stuff is not about you and that you could think about it more tomorrow? So you didn't have to kind of sort if all out, or process it all right then.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098412\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah I mean I guess I was definitely overreacting [inaudible] big time. And feeling that way I was overreacting and making it worse by like being hung over and feeling good. Just afraid of it. (Crying a little)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: But you should be allowed to feel good. That's not a bad thing, and be excited that you feel good. Because it's such a, I think it's a relief to feel good after having felt, you know feeling numb or feeling badly for most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess knowing myself I probably should have sit and tried to calm myself down. I should probably like clean something and cleaning. It isn't like playing with the puppy wasn't good. [0:16:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Well because it gives you a little bit to be active. So maybe setting some time, even though it's at night, thinking well I'm gonna take 15 minutes to speed clean or play with the puppy. But to give you a limited amount of time to discharge some of that energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's really hard with Josh because he just wants to go to bed and he's cranky. It makes it hard for me to be like ok I'm gonna stay up then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Do you guys typically go to bed at the same time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. He would go to bed at like 9 o'clock if left to his own devices. Often he stays up, just relaxing until I go to bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: What would it be like to have separate bedtimes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: I mean it does not come from me, it comes from him. He likes to go to bed<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Would he be okay with that? Going to bed before you.[0:17:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and sometimes he does. He's so tired, or if I still have work to do. We were always on the same sort of schedule, just because it's what we both like to do, just as for well I'm also please to exercise in the morning. And I don't know but he's having a lot of trouble lately because he's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">going in 2 weeks to get his next procedure. Still kind of in a bad rhythm. Trying to like, I think feels terrible all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: So that must be hard for both of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean. It's kind of a bummer. The better I feel, like I gotta go run after school, and he gets really sad that he couldn't come with me, and that just makes me feel bad. I've told you this before, it was more of a problem last year when he was really [inaudible] and not doing so well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">He's not really depressed, I think he was, but just sort of. You know I just. No fun, and he was really sad and I wished he could come with me too. [0:18:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: How often are you able to go off and do like your run after school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: I mean lately, whenever. [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: The past weeks lately?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yes. Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: It's hard when you're feeling good takes you farther away from him. It's hard for him, you feel a little bit badly about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah I mean. We used to always go on adventures. Cannot really go on adventures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: How is it impacting your relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Our relationship is good. Mostly he's been super wrapped up in applying to schools. Which has not been going well. Poor guy. [0:19:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: He had a professor not submit a recommendation for [inaudible] despite a zillion calls and e-mails. He kind of, he did not do it. Every year this happens to like both people I know. Yeah and he even like. And this is a guy that is applying to schools to work for also. [inaudible] also is the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD1\">same school, so anyway. For [inaudible] it's not a good person to wait for. The important thing is [inaudible] Then he studied [inaudible] ended up getting the same score he got 5 years ago. So it was a waste of time. Now he's just got of a stress case over the whole thing.

Which is nice, but yeah he's definitely putting his energy into that. So that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: What are you still connecting on? What is keeping your relationship fulfilling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, no it is, definitely. Well we always have our morning coffee time, which despite all my like soft spots wanting to like just get up and go to school or whatever we just always. It's too nice to get rid of despite the fact that it's not very productive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Well, what is it productive for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Well it is productive for our relationship.

I don't know before I got my period this month, maybe like a few days before. I was just like the thought of staying out late was above me. But it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201211\">wasn't, it was pretty obvious what was happening. It wasn't that I was not sleeping or anything, I was just drained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: And that was really connected to your cycle, and then once you got your period you felt more energized?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Okay.

No restlessness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Uh no, no. The first time I felt restless in a while was last night.

Like if I get up, I mean I get up every 1\/2 hour and like go get the laundry and bring it up, or like 1\/2 an hour later I'll go and do something else useful and to him that's just like horrible.

So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: How are things with your family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: My family is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: How you feeling toward Dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: He's keeping away, I haven't talked to him in awhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: I know when we first started meeting, your anger toward him was pretty strong. And it's not something you've brought up in awhile, so I guess I just wanted to check in see how it was over Thanksgiving, and if it's an important piece right now. [0:25:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: It's not. Over Thanksgiving I really did not talk to him very much. He started off Thanksgiving telling a story about you know we feel about being doomed, and whatever and I started crying. It was really embarrassing, and uncomfortable. I couldn't bring myself to really talk to him for the rest <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201511\">of the day. [inaudible] forgive him for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: How did other people respond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: Similarly.

Life is meaningless, whatever it is that he was feeling, and then couldn't hold it in. And I mean it was like a long story. This went on for awhile. And I had actually the same problem last night. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D1\">The dream was kind of weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: It's not your typical Thanksgiving meal talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: She actually loved it. Her family is a mess right now. Her Dad is divorced from her Mom and moved to like England, and I don't know it's bad though. My Dad's other friend whose family live far away love my family probably because we're very emotional. And my Dad loves to share. I don't know <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201611\">things were interesting. Especially now that [inaudible] to us, so. [0:27:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: And I bought my Dad pants.

[0:28:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: And my Mom will play guitar because she doesn't, I mean she has blinders for him and his emotional. She let him [inaudible]. She [inaudible] it'll be Hanukkah. But now at the pants he'll probably cry because he came to visit me, and we actually had a tolerable weekend, for some reason we can <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201711\">shop together. I don't know why exactly. It's one thing we can actually do. He really likes to go shopping with me, and he wears. He spends no money on himself ever, and he's a good looking guy, or could he be a lot more if he really wanted to. So I made him try on a pair of my pants that were not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201712\">nice, but nice enough, and he was like so excited. He looked so good in them, but they were too expensive and he wouldn't buy them so I bought them for him because he refused to. I couldn't let him continue on with his crappy pants when he could look that good so. [0:29:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: And he looked, every time he wears them he tells me he's wearing them. He'll tell everyone else in the whole entire family about them. It's exciting I have more pants for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">THERAPIST: Well that's really thoughtful of you. One, to be able to know that this is really meaningful to him, and to do something that you know he will really enjoy. That really is the meaning of giving. So it's nice of you to be able to do that. Even though you anticipate being annoyed and frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201751\">by other aspects of how he'll handle the holiday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah when he gets like that, I don't know, it's a problem. I kind of shut off a little bit. The more emotion he shows the less I'm capable of showing. [0:30:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: And so in a way that's not, doesn't cause problems in our relationship. Just that. It's not actual conversation which we are getting into a fight or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: There's no confrontation, but I mean you said I kind of didn't talk to my dad over Thanksgiving so it's fine. So when you saw him responding to something in a way that felt inappropriate to you. Or if not inappropriate at least the sort of intensity felt really inappropriate to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Um hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: You put up a barrier. Because it was too much for you to handle so you created that distance and kind of shut down a little bit or shut off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: Which made it tolerable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: In the context of like this happens all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">CLIENT: And maybe one time would have been fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Sure, if it was unique event you probably would have tried to find a way to understand what was going on. But this is not a unique event. This is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">CLIENT: If my Mom cried it would be on my gosh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: You would respond really differently. [0:31:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah my Mom. The last time I saw my Mom cry like it was the first night I could remember since I was like, maybe ever, was when grandfather died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: And she was crying at that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: She was crying a little, and you just knew that she was so sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: And tears at grief and death feels appropriate, so you did not feel judgmental of her response. And felt genuine and on target and I'm sure you felt sad seeing your Mom so sad. But when you see your Dad crying about something that feels inappropriate because you know like you said, he's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201971\">connected really to the Native American story. It's not fresh wound. It's hard for you to feel empathy for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098412\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah and I also worry about how much of that, is part of my problem. Like last night I was getting so hyper and sometimes I feel like I might come off kind of nuts. I asked Josh, I was like I hope I didn't come off like totally crazy by the end of the night. He said I don't think so. Okay I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201991\">hope not. [0:32:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">THERAPIST: But you're worried how your intensity affects other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I'm not this crazy when other people are like that. Like the girl I went on the bike ride with, she seems kind of<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: She felt overwhelmed by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">THERAPIST: So I think our goal is to find a way for you to feel what you're feeling, and channel it. To have a little bit more control over how you're channeling it. So that when you're getting feedback, you know like from that girl on the bike ride a couple of weeks ago, you kind of, you were getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A31\">the sense from her that maybe this was a little much. But you couldn't. There was not another way for you to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">CLIENT: Right, and like my Dad I was like all wrapped up in my own emotions over how fun this was. And then I go bag, and then I'm comparing myself to my Dad. That's so horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">THERAPIST: You have a little bit more awareness than Dad. You don't know what to do with it yet, but you don't have another way to channel it, but you noticed. [0:33:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, and something. I have one friend who would always, we would go on long walks and do whatever else we were doing, I realized a longtime and time without me, and she would constantly ask me these like really caring questions about what am I on and stuff. I wish I could rely on her, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A91\">wish that like<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">THERAPIST: When did you notice that it felt lopsided?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">CLIENT: When, I forget exactly when the first conversation we had was. I was like well you know enough of that, I remember she had to tell me something terrible. Something, I forget exactly what, but there was one quotation where the end of my time telling some silly story or whatever was happening, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD1\">you know she told me that her and her husband were in therapy because he wanted kids and she did not. I was like really, I could not have held that in for half and hour conversation for whatever I was doing. Probably grad school, you know but she was a good friend. She's like how's it going? What's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD2\">happening? She remembers everything. [0:34:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: And by being friends with her I was do I really need to ask her what's going on, what's going, because if I did not ask her I would never find out. So [inaudible] that friendship was really good. I guess I need to ask more questions. And Josh and I are both really bad with that. So, we had made <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF1\">a pact last New Year's to be like okay we're gonna stop with our bad habits, like telling silly stories about secret [inaudible] just act like we put the.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">THERAPIST: A combo?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: I think being you will take, do both. Some people are only comfortable in their asking questions mode, and not comfortable disclosing things about themselves, and that act feels lopsided too. So I'm glad that you have this awareness that when asked a question it's easier for you to talk about, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B51\">you know answer questions and talk about yourself then to do the reverse. You've got that awareness so you can add on to what your skills are and do both. [0:35:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098412\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well I mean I have less pressure seeing as my Dad usually does not ask questions. Usually he remembers what's happening in tears. He just end up sort of unraveling in a mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">THERAPIST: And it sounds like you're not a carbon copy of Dad. Although, there may be some similarities that you dislike seeing. But you're not a carbon copy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">CLIENT: Well. So like when I have a great timeLike I'll chat with other people [inaudible] I hope I would be doing a good job of asking and whatever was going, and I mean I hope I hope so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">THERAPIST: And you said you asked Josh first for sort of his impact on how the other night went. You don't trust his response I'm guessing from the.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">CLIENT: He was cranky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Do you have a sense of whether you asked other people or paid attention to how other people were responding. What their feedback was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">CLIENT: I mean it was a conversation, it was a fun conversation. So I'm sure it was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">THERAPIST: A one-sided, one person show?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I'm not a big group of friends person, I would feel uncomfortable in that I wasn't [inaudible]. You know their like the [inaudible]. It's a really cool clothing line. [0:36:14] Friends, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Well it sounds like one way to try to harness that energy is to think about kind of slowing things down. You're at a point where recognize what's going on, you can feel it. So now I think you're job is, when you want to, to be able to sort of slow things down a little bit, and slow it down <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201C91\">and calm it down a little bit. So that you can have some, sort of a choice of how you responding rather than feeling like, it's happening, happening, happening, happening and you don't have any control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah I mean it's like the relaxing of your common parts. I try, but [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Well I mean it's hard to just switch modes. I think just like in a book, you know, it reaches the climax and then it doesn't end. There's that whole part where things start to get wrapped up, and they answer questions, and it slowly kind of comes to a conclusion. [0:37:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">THERAPIST: You don't have a huge, big you know climax of the book and then cliffhanger. And that's exactly what you're trying to do to yourself. Get home, and relax in my bed, and I think you need to give yourself that part, you know that falling down part where things kind of slowly get wrapped up <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF1\">and processed, and moved on to the next phase. And you know, giving yourself some period to do something active, because your way in is through your body. And then but wrapping that up so its not getting home at 11 o'clock and going for an hour run. But giving yourself 15 minutes to yeah, dust the shelves, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF2\">or organize the books, or do a load of laundry, but something where you move around a little bit, and feeling like your getting something accomplished but not in a further arousing way. [0:38:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D1\">CLIENT: I wish I'd thought of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Why is that [inaudible] all the time lately?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">CLIENT: Did it run out of space?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Maybe that's what it is we have 53 seconds of space so. Well we're gonna do 10 minutes of relaxation, and whether it gets you closure or not is not important.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098412\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB\">THERAPIST: So we will practice relaxation here and then we will see how you can use that to try to you know.
