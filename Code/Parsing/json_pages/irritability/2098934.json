I got the message when I'm like getting ready to leave the house in the morning just like happy or whatever and wait. Let me preface this by saying make sure you remember that I e-mailed him and like we got into that whole thing about the e-mail and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">I like listed what I'd like him to please take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there's a whole bunch of stuff and you anticipated that Franklin (ph) wasn't planning to be there for that long; he wasn't going to take a lot of it and you were going to have to deal with it and your (inaudible) was shit again like everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Well, first of all the morning started off very typically with a message from him saying the guy that's helping him now isn't free until one. Okay, whatever. I was already out of the house. I had shit to do. Fine. Well, that leads to another story but, so that he's not coming till one. Then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">like ((inaudible) out with Steph like we're shopping, like we had breakfast, like whatever and I get a he called me at one and says that he forgot the key and asks if I'm still home and like, so then I don't know like maybe he was like hoping that I would be home, who knows, but it made me like happier <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">((inaudible) at 00:01:21) since we broke up and like I know I was like, \u2018this is so fucking typical. Like, \u2018Jesus Christ, like the one thing you needed to bring was the goddamn keys, like I don't understand.' And luckily my roommate was home so she let him in. Even though he could have just gone back <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">to his house and gotten them, like, so whatever. Okay. Then I guess he does his thing. I don't come back until later that night when literally I came home to like change and go back out and then didn't have a great night Saturday night because me and Steph were supposed to go out, like we looked really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">cute, whatever, and we ended up going to this party where this guy that she's like not dating but using, whatever, like it's her little distraction so that like the guy that we graduated from high school with she ended up hanging out with that night after the reunion and like had been talking to and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200195\">they ended up like making out or something and having sleepovers, whatever. I don't think they're sleeping together, but, which is like, whatever, which is weird to me, like ((inaudible) sleepovers. But anyway, to each his own. And we ended up at his house and he lives with this other guy, Aidan, who <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200196\">I also went to high school with and know who is married. Like I really didn't understand, I mean he was living with someone for a while and like had a girlfriend, never met her and went back and married her a few months ago. Hopefully not for like green card purposes I have seen that not work out clearly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200197\">and, but I guess she's having trouble getting here, so anyway he lives with Aidan, this guy that Steph's so we ended up at their house and like I was really annoyed. I wanted to sleep in my bed. I was like feeling emotional about going home. But I like I still wanted to hang out and I didn't want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200198\">to be alone and ((inaudible) woman and blah, blah, blah. So I ended up going there, got in a better mood and we smoked a joint, hung out, had another drink, but like I slept really uncomfortably because I was on the couch, like not comfortable. And then I went home Sunday and like literally stayed in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200199\">my room all day, like wasn't ready to walk around and look, like literally did not look at anything and then Monday went to work, had a difficult day at work because on Saturday in the morning what I did was I went to that oil place that my friend Sergio had suggested I go to talk to his friend. My <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001910\">car was leaking oil so I was like, and then my friend Sergio was like, \u2018oh, go to my friend who works at blah, blah, blah. So I went and I asked for the friend and said, \u2018Sergio sent me,' like **, cause which was really nice, because honestly, it is nice to have like a ((inaudible) like especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001911\">in a garage situation and you're a female. And he basically like took me down under the car and showed me where it was leaking from and suggested I go to the dealership because it will just be a better fix and it's like maybe going to be a $10 difference or maybe $20. So I go there and I ended up renting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001912\">a car from them for the day because it's the Honda dealer and it's a schlep and whatever, so also the bill was $260 that I don't have so I had to charge it, okay? Then he gives me a whole other laundry list of stuff to do, one of which is tie rods which is linked to the steering -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098934\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: This is the guy at the dealership?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I like freaked out and so I was like freaking out on Monday when he called me and told me this and I had a bad day Monday. Then Monday night I was like, all right, I'm going to go through because I wanted to clean my house anyway and **. I was so enraged when I saw how much he left. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">I mean he took the weight bench and he took his suitcases that I packed and left for him and left all of the garbage that he had collected in the pantry, like all the crates, all the kitty litter container, like random bottles, all this shit that he left, all of his projects he was going to do he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">was going to build a sound studio recording with the egg he was going to make wine or I don't know the fucking heater for our kit I don't know. All this stuff he never did, obviously. Then, the whole closet in the office like computer screens, old keyboards, two broken Polaroids, the $50 piece <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">of shit video camera that he needed to get off Craig's List because he needed it for projects and never used. Like, literally like a closet of broken dreams and promises and I was like so enraged I was like drinking, I was like having a cocktail, enraged and I think that like being so enraged, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D4\">all the adrenalin literally like poured out of the trash and recycling like three trips down the stairs of shit I was putting out on the street that I wasn't going to bother with, like pile of donation, like all this stuff. Right? And he had e-mailed me like, \u2018I'm done, like ** and he had the balls <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D5\">to say, oh well earlier I had said it was really nice to hear your voice, like \u2018I really miss you and then hearing your voice made me miss you more that's why I told you it would be kind of hard for me to see you and I hope you didn't mean all the things that you said to me the other day because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D6\">would never think anything like that about you, you know, and I'll love you forever.' And he wrote back nicely and said like, \u2018I could never mean any of those things, I could only ever feel loving towards you,' like, okay, very nice but then (inaudible at  he has the balls to say, \u2018I'm done, and whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D7\">I've left you can do what you please with. Maybe you can sell some of it to pay off some of the debt,' like he literally had the balls to write that. And I know in his head he's like, \u2018oh, I'm being helpful.' But, first of all it's shit that we never were able to sell together, like we tried to put <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D8\">it on Craig's List a thousand times and have a yard sale and whatever. Second of all it's worth the maybe $300 that I would get from these random computer parts to not have to look up what they would cost, figure out how to sell them it's worth that money to me to not have to do it. Is he kidding <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D9\">me? You're welcome to hang onto this stuff and sell it. Like, while I delete everything that is about you ever. And so, I wrote back and I was like, \u2018okay, thanks, blah, blah, blah, whatever. So then I was like, \u2018well, thanks for making it that much easier for me to now have closure over you because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D10\">this is so typical and you are such an asshole for doing this. That's a real asshole move and especially because I specifically had mentioned this shit in the pantry, the egg cartons and the I said, \u2018whatever you don't like you can leave on the street or put in the (inaudible) at . I specifically <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D11\">mentioned those things and he just straight up was like, \u2018no, I'm not going to bother.' So, I got it all out in one night. In retrospect, probably some of the computer stuff I probably could have donated or whatever, but I was like so annoyed at it that I like, \u2018I'm putting it on the street.' But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D12\">did keep some stuff to donate like the video camera and a flash, like one of his many photography parts that he needed so badly to have immediately to have a full collection of shit that he's never going to do anything with. A fucking hoarder. So it really made me mad but really, honestly it did kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D13\">of cause a shift in my thinking about like how I was getting over this or whatever, I mean it was definitely helpful to have this stuff out. But just in terms of like him doing that to me was really like, nah, like you just made it a lot easier to like move on right now and that's great and I mean other <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D14\">than like breaking down this week about my car and then I did my January budget and I'm like really tight and just like, I was like wanting to maybe go on a vacation with Steph like during my time off and like just charge it anyway but whatever, but now I can't because I have to do some stuff to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D15\">car. My friend, Sergio, was like, \u2018I'll call the place where I go, like he's great. I'll talk to them and let them know you're coming and he was very helpful. But I'm just freaking out about do I get a new car, like what do I do and my dad's like, \u2018don't fix anything, just drive it till it dies.' I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D16\">was like, \u2018what? No, don't put any more money in it. You've put like $5,000 in it this year and I was like, \u2018I know, but like, what if it needs new brakes, like it's winter; tie rods have to do with steering, I'm not sure I want to risk that, Dad. Like, worse I'm still leaking oil because of another <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D17\">thing. And like his thinking, and so my other friend -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098934\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What year's the car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20021\">CLIENT: Two thousand two. It's an old car and I haven't taken good care of it because I haven't known how to take care of a car and (inaudible) at . But his solution was stupid and my friend Sergio was like who's had a lot of cars and you know has a business that he needs a lot of trucks for because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200211\">he does real estate and construction stuff and he was like, \u2018fix the tie rods and the brakes and like then just change the oil and it should be good for another year. You're probably fine and stop freaking out.' So I'll probably try to do that when I'm off for the three weeks instead of trying to fit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200212\">it in now because Saturdays are busy at garages, whatever. So I'm just going to wait for that. But I was freaking out about it this week and e-mailed my parents my budget and stuff and like I don't understand how to live, like I don't want to cut out manicures like once or twice a month. I don't want <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200213\">to cut out like whatever grooming stuff, salon, that wrap thing whatever it may be. I don't want to not being going out with my friends and having dinner and drinks and whatever and I don't really know how to budget all this with the debt that I have and the fact that I'm trying to pay over the minimums <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200214\">and having a really high insurance because of an accident I had and the points are not off yet or whatever because it was about seven years ago or whatever the case is. And I guess like my dad and they didn't want to talk about it and whatever but like it's just difficult to talk about it with them <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200215\">because I don't, like they'll tell me to just like not spend as much but I don't know. I don't know how to first of all like I don't know how to budget just like for myself. Like I still have just been kind of just doing whatever I want because I need to enjoy myself. But like budgeting how much groceries <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200216\">I get, whether it's like the money, the budget itself, amounts like I got way to many yogurts that I didn't even eat and I think also the reason I haven't wanted to grocery shop or cook is just that I don't know how to do it for one anymore and like I need to figure that out. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20023\">(Pause): [00:11:03 00:11:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20025\">CLIENT: And I don't know what they're going to suggest, like I really don't know what, you know, I mean my father's already given me $250 a month to help me with stuff, but like I'm still like budget-wise on the spread sheet I like budgeted -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: How far off are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Like a hundred bucks but that's like with giving a really low estimate to stuff like dinners out and like miscellaneous like snacks and coffees and whatever, like that's like really low because I don't know. And I got really annoyed at my mom because her suggestion she was like, \u2018well, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200291\">know, this is not immediately helpful, but it's helpful to budget and just like put in an amount that you think that you would spend on that permanent, but for everything like clothing and everything and then just like try to get as close to that as possible,' and I'm like, what do you think I've been <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200292\">doing the past two years?' And then she was like, \u2018well, I mean what you need to start doing is actually keeping track of the actual amounts to see how far off you are at the end of the month and I'm like, \u2018what do you think I'm already doing?' She says, \u2018wait, you add in like the amounts?' And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200293\">like, \u2018yeah, I know exactly how much I spent on dining last month. I know exactly how much I spent on alcohol. I know exactly how much I spent on every fucking little item whether it was on my credit card or on my debit card and so I was like enraged at her for like not having paid attention to me when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200294\">I talked about budget before, because I've told her all this. I've told her how meticulous I am about writing stuff down every penny and you know wanting to know how much I spent on parking and quarters, you know, and so she didn't pay attention to that and that really annoyed me. We talked a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200295\">about how mad I was about her unloading on me and not really like asking to come over, asking how I was or whatever and she like apologized and you know, wants to make more of an effort to do that and so that's fine or whatever. And then Tracy's response was jut like, \u2018well we'll sit down and talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200296\">what is appropriate to cut down on and blah, blah, blah and I'm like, \u2018you don't know anything, like you don't even wear bras, so if you don't even have that in your budget and you wear clothes from 1985 and don't wear deodorant and don't do any makeup or hair or anything so really like you have no <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200297\">idea how much I should be spending on that, like, at all (laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098934\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2002B\">THERAPIST: (Laughs). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2002D\">CLIENT: So for her to say that is like, \u2018well why were you spending so much on clothing?' \u2018Like, \u2018cause it costs money and I do stuff like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Is a lot of this it sounds like you have a bunch of additional expenses after you and [by you] (ph) broke up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20031\">CLIENT: Well, it's just that I'm paying all of it by myself now so that's the adjustment. So, whereas I had two incomes and so I wasn't paying for all of it like I paid over the minimums on the credit cards but I wasn't doing all of it, so it like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20033\">THERAPIST: I see. He was helping out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because all of our stuff was combined and we just split everything down the middle. It all came out of my account and his money went in and then he would take $200 a month for like personal spending money and I would, too. Even though I usually didn't and he usually did because I was the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200351\">one doing the budgeting and like, whatever. So that's where the struggle is I think coming in now and my mom suggested like as if it's a realistic thought to try to get a third roommate and I was like, \u2018what?' First of all the only available room would be right across from mine. Second of all, two bathrooms, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200352\">one bathroom three people, no; third of all, it's my house. Like I don't want to bring another person like I'm a grown up. Like it's I don't think my landlord would even allow it, or would raise the rent so it would not matter.

And it's like, \u2018well, no, you should actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200411\">be suggesting that I reel it out because now I should be spending more money on going out and stuff because I actually am doing it with my friends and for like my future, not for like my current relationship.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20043\">THERAPIST: Right.

I, you know and that's it. So, I do like the suggestion better <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D2\">of yeah, okay, like I can't go on my little vacation because I have to fix my car or whatever, but it is going to run for another year and then maybe I can try to afford something I like better or figure it out then, so great. So, that was another thing that I was like no, I'm not going to do that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D3\">like I'm not going to buy a car that I don't like which is not worth it to me.

Last summer, like a year ago I got a raise from like 49 9 to like 51 6, just a merit based raise and that was after I got the raise like the union raise which is usually a small percentage and I think it went from like 47 to 49 9 or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">CLIENT: Then I got the merit based raise but then we were supposed to get our raises in July through the union but they've been in negotiations with the university because they either were trying to raise the amount that they give us or or, it's not university, it's something that's going on that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">they've been in negotiations and it's a real pain in the ass.

It would be slightly noticeable but not all that much.

And, so well, and then there's that situation of the loan with the jeweler and the whole situation. Did I even tell you this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I don't remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">CLIENT: Oh, God. So (inaudible) needed a loan, I wanted a loan and like the idiot that I was the entire three years I was like okay and he was paying it back and it was like $3500 from my 401K. So we're paying back ourselves and it's like, I'm paying it back myself and it's like 4 percent or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD1\">like that. Then, it turns out that (inaudible) wanted to buy a ring and I like started working with this jeweler that we had gone to talk to about like selling some gold that was the jeweler of my friend who did her wedding rings and like he gave us an education on diamonds and blah, blah, blah. Then <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD2\">I asked about it because like, \u2018are you still giving me money, the loan' I don't know, like, \u2018what do you want to do with this?' and like he explained the whole thing, that he even talked to the guy Sergio, \u2018I'm working with him and blah, blah, blah,' and it's like I've already paid $2400 and I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD3\">know if he had the rest of the $3500 or like spent it or paid it off, whatever, it doesn't matter. I wasn't really paying the loan. And like he asked me to deal with it. \u2018Cause like the thing is, the jeweler had like the gold, like had my gold and like this stuff that we were going to sell and whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD4\">and he was like, had all my stuff. And it was like, \u2018can you deal with this?' So, luckily like I'd already had a relationship with this guy<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">\u2018cause I'd brought jewelry to him to be fixed and whatever and so I called in explaining and he was like, \u2018oh, I was wondering why he wasn't calling me back,' or, like (inaudible) at  or whatever, so I had to go there and literally figure it out and he was really nice and gave me back all the money -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: that (inaudible) paid. And, coincidentally that was exactly the amount that was still owed on the loan, like, I'll have $70 left that was owed on the loan. So I paid that off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">THERAPIST: On the 401K loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes. So, and then I think he's now going to stop the money that he is sending to my account each month that he was sending to my account to pay that loan because the loan was coming through my account. So, ridiculous. So I paid that. So then there is an option of retaking another loan. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B71\">I can take up to 4500 -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098934\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">CLIENT: from the 401K and put that towards some of the bigger interest credit cards so then I'd be paying a lower interest back to myself which is something my father suggested and I can do that fine, but it's just putting money from one place to another but the debt is still there in other words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">CLIENT: It paid me in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">THERAPIST: But it's still debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: Exactly.

And I cannot, like you're that happened to me thing, thing to do. And I was like, \u2018wow, you're right.' And I hadn't really thought about <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C32\">that. My parents never once said that. They've only like shitted on me for doing that and like haven't even thought of that in the whole process of like why I have more debt because I helped this man save his mouth, basically. And I haven't gotten one ounce of like, \u2018well I remember you had that big <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C33\">expense, like maybe we didn't agree with it, but you know that has to do with why you're in more debt now because you don't know we're paying that. It's $12,000 we paid $500 a month for two years with zero interest and we were both paying it. I mean I was always making more money than him and also <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C34\">I didn't mean to do that, like I didn't need to be paying half of it. Like my friend Mandy was actually like, \u2018you helped him enough, like by co-signing, you shouldn't be paying for any of it.' But anyway it was there was that issue, too. I don't think about it. There's nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: It's just like you have an expensive few years and you have a lot of the debt is by you and is like blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">(Pause): [00:27:47 00:27:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: I even was like maybe I should just tell my dad, \u2018whatever amount of money you were going to spend on the wedding that you probably thought was coming up soon with me and [Franklin] (ph) just give it to me. I'll figure it out when I get married which is like I'm not going to do because it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB1\">just inappropriate but it would fix things because I'm sure he put aside like a decent amount for that. But, like I'm never going to do that. And then I get an e-mail from my stepmom because she had been like, \u2018oh, we'll think of something and that's when I wrote back with like, \u2018well, here's all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB2\">information you need to help you.' And then she e-mailed me that daddy's going to call you, he's going to reach out to you about this to talk about this more, like I'm not sure why and was like, \u2018okay, thanks.' I'll probably hear from him I guess.

I think that that's kind of a like a little (inaudible) at 00:30:31] because I am stressed about money and I feel like if I have a better handle on it, it just makes all those other things in terms of getting my routine in order and all that, easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It would also be nice if somebody had your back a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, totally.

Like, \u2018you learned a lesson now let's hope you get in a position <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E51\">that when this is paid down you have an idea of what's appropriate to spend on what.'

I bet you could have predicted it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200F51\">I mean these are your parents and you know them pretty well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, would say, \u2018are you spending too much on x,y,z?'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that they would probably at least in part be pains in the ass and always be pains in the ass, you know, at least treating you like you're irresponsible, like you're not thinking about this, like the solution is probably obvious, you just haven't thought of it, or thought enough about <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200F91\">it, making you feel worse about it, not just helping you out.

Can you help me out or not? You know, whether there's a way in which that actually sort of would <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201012\">convey sort of more ownership and more being on top of it which in fact you are, but I can imagine you're sort of bringing everything to them and sort of on one hand in an effort to show them that you're on top of it, is actually in a way like a bit infantilizing to yourself and maybe even sort of pulling <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201013\">a little bit for the kind of responses that they're giving you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It's still bad and you don't want to think about it like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20185\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20187\">THERAPIST: You'd rather focus on your efforts to be on top of things now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20189\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018B\">THERAPIST: And yourself as a responsible person in this way even though you also kind of have this other impression of yourself as well and it feels like it's the one you're kind of inviting them to take on and get angry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it will be good to have a discussion with them about it. But realistically, if they don't offer to give me any money which is totally, which is a possibility or whatever, then I am going to have to make a decision to lower some of my monthly payments because they're like I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2018D1\">what's going to have to happen and so that's what I think I'm going to have to think about as the option for me and maybe doing the 401K thing so I don't have to have 14 percent on the cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N2018C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098934\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Lower interest rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20191\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20193\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20195\">CLIENT: So, next Friday?
