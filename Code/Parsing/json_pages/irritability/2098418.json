Like things are getting better with Sydney. Like when we talked after the fight. So I think the problem I guess is my tone of voice when I'm mad at him. (SIGH) And... Because like when we get into an argument, you know, and he says I'm yelling at him. I'm like, \"I'm not yelling.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">He's like, \"Well you sound really upset.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: And I'm like, \"I am really upset.\" Like... (SIGH) I mean, I guess the solution then is to figure out how to fix my tone of voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Do you hear what he's saying? Like do you, can you hear in your voice what he's reacting to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Not always. Like I mean, I used to think I sound mad but I don't think I sound like more mad than I am or really super duper mad and I just don't know if it's like... You know, part of me is like, \"Well I'm angry and I want you to know it and... But then again that's just hurting him so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I don't know. I told him, \"Well, why don't we record the next fight we have and then I can listen to my voice.\" But I don't know if that would... Like I guess I have to... But I think the only way to change it is to like be more patient while being mad. Like it seems like the only way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Well you... Finding a way to say that you're angry...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: ...but speaking calmly might make it easier for him to hear what you're really saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because then he shuts down and it's like he's not listening to me and then he gets mad because I'm repeating myself. I'm like, \"But you're not listening to me. You're shutting down and not letting me talk, interrupting me. That's not really going to work.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Right. So you do want to find a way that you can have a conversation that you can both participate in. If he's shutting down he's not really participating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: And if he's shutting down because he finds the tone too overwhelming...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: ...then it's not really working for you either because you're not being able to express really what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's just that then... (SIGH) I don't know what to do other than try to be calm when I'm not calm. And like if a fight is happening I'm very much not calm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Can you delay the conversation until you are calm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Umm... (SIGH) Maybe. I mean, the last time it was in the context of trying to wake him up on Saturday morning and Friday night he did the thing where he like stayed up late and then like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Was this after... So I spoke to you Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: So next Friday it happened again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Next Friday, yeah. I'm like, \"We had this conversation. You promised you wouldn't, you promised you'd take the Ambien before you were, you know, trying to stay up late, whatever.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">Because first he wanted to get a snack. He was like listening to some lecture when he got a snack and then he like got up again to like shower and shave and he took the Ambien right before he showered and shaved as opposed to taking the Ambien before he got the snack at like, you know... So he ended <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">up taking more like four AM or whatever instead of two AM or something and like it was at least a two hour time difference if not longer. I think it was even one AM that he could have taken it but like, you know, he's acknowledged that he's like, you know (inaudible) he's told me before that he wouldn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">do it again and he does it again. It's just like so frustrating. I'm like, \"Why do you keep on doing this?\" Because he's like, you know, being so immature. Like he doesn't want to face the day or whatever. He wants some alone time right now at like really late but then it like impacts our plans for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D3\">the next day, like things he's promised. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">It's like really hard for me to deal with and so like, you know, it was in the context of trying to wake him up that morning and maybe I should've been nicer about it when I woke him up but I was just so pissed that he wouldn't wake up and I had to wait like another two hours before I could do anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">because like he needed more sleep. But he needed more sleep... It was his own fault. (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: What were your plans that day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well one thing he promised me we'd actually make out because we hadn't for like weeks and because he was up for it on Friday night but then he was too tired and so he was like, \"I definitely will want to tomorrow.\" And then he was just like sleeping and I sort of knew that like... I mean, granted <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">this is like a bunch of steps but like in the past when something like this has happened when I let him sleep in he's going to be hungry for lunch and not want to do anything and then after lunch he'll, he often will end up eating too much and need time to digest and like, you know, or not feel good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">and then nothing will ever happen and he'll change his mind and it had been weeks and I was kind of going crazy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">Or at least a week at that... It had been like a week and a half or two weeks and it just made me feel like his desire to watch, like listen to those lectures that night at that point was more important than like being intimate with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Is that a feeling that you've shared with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes it is. And he feels pressure but I'm like it's sort of hard not to like... You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It seems very honest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like, you know, it'd be one thing if I knew like going into this relationship that he had really low libido but like when he's not depressed he doesn't and he's starting to get better but then he had like a cold that like, you know, he's had for three weeks and so that's making things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">hard even if he is getting better mentally. Like he's not better physically and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well it sounds like that's one component of it is not... I mean, part of it is feeling like there's not enough intimacy but he's also not following through on other plans that you've made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like he ended up being awake for New Year's Eve but we didn't get to do anything romantic mostly because he was sick and so that was a disappointment. He was like, \"Oh, we can do something romantic later in the week.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" That never happened either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: But again I guess he keeps on thinking he'll feel better and then he doesn't. So there's like nothing I can really do about that. At least I got him to go to the doctor. And I did. And he actually like called and made an appointment. He called last Wednesday and then he had the appointment last <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">Thursday and they like did a bunch of tests and he doesn't have mono or strep or anything but he did because of a debilitating cough, they gave him an inhaler to use if he's coughing too much and that's actually been helping. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Oh good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm really glad he finally got over the whole not seeing the doctor thing and then he's like, \"Should I go in for an actual check up?\" And I'm like, \"Yes. You haven't had one in three years.\" So like sometimes we make progress but sometimes we still fight and like, you know, I was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">so afraid on Saturday that like, you know, maybe we'll never be able to figure it out. And like I don't know a good solution other than don't sad mad when I'm mad or like have to keep everything in until I feel more calm which like I guess is the mature adult thing to do. But like I feel like then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">don't get to accurately express my pain and frustration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Well I think there's... You know, the... Part of it is the chronicity of it in that this is not, these are not isolated events. They're not feeling like isolated events anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: So, you know, you have a right to express your anger. He also has a right to have your feelings expressed to him in a way that feels respectful and I don't know if that's what he's saying, that it feels... Does the tone of your voice feel disrespectful to him? I don't know. That's not a word <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">that you used.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's not a word that he really used either. It was just more he said, you know, that I keep on hurting him. So it's hurtful I guess which is even worse that disrespectful but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: What feels hurtful about being angry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I guess he doesn't like it when I'm angry at him and he thinks it... You know? I mean, I don't like it when people are angry at me. I guess the difference is it feels like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: It feels like you have a right to be angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know what to do. And it's not like I'm taking out my frustrations on, from something else on him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I'm taking my frustrations at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Right and you sort of, you want him to take responsibility for the, for the things that he's doing that result in you feeling angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah and it just really bothers me. He says, \"I'm sorry.\" I'm like, \"Okay, you said that the last time too.\" You know? And it's not... I'm not yelling. I'm not raising my voice. Like I was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: But the tone feels yelling because the tone feels...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: ...like you're reprimanding him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Which I am...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: ...because I'm annoyed at him because he keeps on doing the same things over and over again while promising not, while promising not to do them. It's just like how do I trust you if you don't ever follow through on your promises? Which I guess it's an over generalization. It's not like he never <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">follows through. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: So you keep telling him that you're angry...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: ...and he keeps saying, \"I'm sorry.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: So which one of you is going to stop doing the same thing over and over?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I guess I'm the only one who can because, you know, and I've told him before that like if he says he's sorry that just makes me more angry...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: ...because I don't believe him. You know, I think he just, sorry that he did something that made me angry but not that like, or that whatever he did made me angry but not that like or that whatever he did made me angry but not like necessarily for whatever he did because he doesn't think he's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">doing anything wrong. But it's like impacting me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Ah. So does he not agree that what he's doing is detrimental to the relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: I guess he doesn't. He thinks that I'm being the detrimental one by getting mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: I mean, somewhat he... I don't know. I guess with the staying up late thing. He thinks he's an adult. He's entitled to do that. I'm like, \"Okay. But if you make promises for the next day and stuff it's really frustrating.\" And... Like he does admit sometimes that some of the stuff he does it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">self destructive especially because he is an insomniac and trying to fix that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">Like you need to get a regular sleep schedule if you're going to try to get out of depression and... But like, you know, so there's sometimes he thinks they're right and sometimes he doesn't think they're right. And... Whereas I usually think I'm right. Because (inaudible) it's not an isolated incident. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">It's a chronic feeling of not mattering sometimes and... Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: That's a really tough pattern that you guys are stuck in because you can't change his behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And it seems like for both of you, you don't really feel like... Neither one of you feels like you need to change what you're doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: You feel like your anger is appropriate and your expectations of him are appropriate. And it sounds like for the most part he feels like what he's doing is appropriate as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. So there's no way to fix it then. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well you can't, you can't fix him and you can't fix a pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You can't change a pattern by yourself. You can only change your response to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: I can try to respond more calmly but I don't think I'm going to get any less like mad about it. Like I have the right to be mad. He's like, \"You can't be mad at me. Don't be mad at me.\" And I'm like, \"You know, I'm allowed my emotions.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yes you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: So all I can really do is just not respond right away and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Why can't you be mad at him? Can he explain why it's not okay for you to be mad? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: No. He said it's... Just said it's not okay to be mad about something. I'm like I have the right to. He doesn't say why, you know? I guess maybe because he can't do anything wrong but like I have the right to be upset. I guess maybe because me being mad hurts him but like he's doing things to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">make me mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: His behavior really just disappoints you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: And he was like asking about me and do I have problems with anger management. Like I don't. I'm not yelling at him. I'm just in a pissed off tone of voice because that's what I am and I'm not, I'm not calling him names. I'm not hitting him or throwing things or even raising my voice. But like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">it's just the tone of my voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Which is pretty honest it sounds like in reflecting what you really feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I guess like what? I have to be dishonest or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Well if you want him to hear your message it sounds like you need to be more in control of the tone of your voice and whether that's being able to take a deep breath and speak calmly even when you don't feel that way or let him know that you're too angry to talk right now and delay the conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">until some of that anger and disappointment has subsided. If you want him to hear the words that you're actually saying it sounds like you do need to change your tone. Whether that's right or wrong isn't the question. Because if you to... If you want to stay in a relationship with him and you want things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">to change the only piece you have control over is how you respond to the situation and it sounds like right now the response of letting him hear the anger that you feel is resulting in him not really being able to hear your message. He hears the tone and shuts down as you say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So the piece that you have control over is can you change the tone and as I sit here and thinking about the two ways to do that are either to delay it until that anger has subsided or to find a way to take that deep breath and then speak in a way that's more calm. I'm not saying that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">don't have a right to be angry or that it's not okay to express your anger. The reason I'm saying this is because he's not hearing you and you want him to hear you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: It makes me a little annoyed that I have to do this in the first place and I can't just express my anger and then deal with it. But like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: I can understand that. You're taking on a lot of the responsibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: And it's just like I feel sometimes like I'm the one doing everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm. I think that's part of why you feel so upset is because you do feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You feel like you're doing your fair share of getting this to work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, things like taking care of him and making food and doing all these things that like, you know, when I was sick and he was panicking, I would still do things for him. You know? I would still make him food even when I was sick or like do crazy things like emptying the dishwasher <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">at his place, standing on a chair while dizzy which I really should not have been doing and things like that. But when he's sick and I'm panicking because he's sick, I still have to do all these things even though in the reverse situation I did all the things. Like I just... I'm taking care of him a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF2\">lot more than he's taking care of me. And it's just really frustrating so, yeah, I can't really do anything though. Like... You know, like if I don't cook, then we don't get food and, you know, I don't want him to starve and I don't want him to starve and I don't want me to starve so, you know, all <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF3\">sorts of things that I just feel like I'm doing everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">I mean, in reality, I guess I'm not doing everything. Sometimes he does things but I think, I still think it's pretty unbalanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: It feels a bit lopsided.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's not like I take down and write every time I've cooked or he's cooked dinner for me or stuff. So... I could be wrong about this but I don't think I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: That's... Certainly it's the story that I've been hearing in here for quite a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And, you know, I am only basing on what you say but this is not inconsistent with things you've said in the past. You have felt that you've been taking one more of the responsibility in the relationship and more of the responsibility of caretaking for a long time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. And like he's been depressed for almost a year. Like that's a really long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yes it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: I mean, it's not his fault because like he's at least, it's not like he's been avoiding therapy and drugs or anything like that. He's... He has appointments. He makes them. He goes to them. I mean, granted a lot of his therapy has been phone sessions because he's been feeling sick but he still <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">usually goes to his therapy twice a week. But it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: So he's doing some of the things that you expect of him in working through this but not all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: That's, you know, one of the reasons his sleep bothers you so much is because that feels like something he could be doing to try to get better that he's not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: ...doing consistently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess more when it impacts my plans for the next day. So it is kind of selfish because if he needs to sleep in on another day and I don't need him for anything then I get, then I'm not mad about it and I can let it go. But when it impacts plans that we would be doing together and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED1\">I have to work around him because he stayed up all night. It's just really tiresome. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry that you guys are having such a hard time being happy together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: I mean, I think most of it's just stems from his depression. That's like why I've been staying is because he can get better from that depression. Eventually, he will and then he won't be like this anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">I mean, some things might still be the same but like he won't... You know, the low libido won't be an issue anymore and, I mean, I guess he'll still be an insomniac but if I can separate my plans from his... I think me having a job would also help things a lot because then I would be getting out of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F51\">the house and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You'd feel less dependent on him for your day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Except I... Yeah. I'm still not up for the past three weeks have stuck with the one application a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: You've gotten that in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Good job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Except that I have been gone and I (inaudible) actually did get two e-mails from two different physicians that I applied to that I did not get the position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: But you don't... You have control of the sending it in piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: So you're doing your job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: And the temp agency hasn't come through with anything yet? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: No. I'm going to call... I mean, they sent (inaudible) they said like skipped a week of Christmas and New Years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Right. Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: So I'm going to call, I don't know, maybe tomorrow or something but they've not come through with anything yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: I will follow up and put it on your list that one of your jobs is to follow up with them tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">THERAPIST: And I think, you know, you can be proud of yourself for getting in your one application a week because that's more than you had been doing the weeks prior. And I know it didn't result in the way you wanted yet but...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: Though my parents... My mom seemed kind of skeptical when I told her I'm doing one application a week. But I'm like, \"It's more than I was doing before.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: That's all I can do right now. So I almost applied to two jobs last week. Like there were two that I could have applied to but the other one, the website to apply for them was like so slow and broken I was just like, \"Screw this. I'm not spending...\" I hadn't written the cover letter yet so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">like I, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">So it wasn't like I expended that much effort only to not apply but it was just... You know, it's one thing to have a really application where you have to fill out the things and basically like replicate your resume and then they ask you for your resume too but if the site won't even load, that's my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">point of giving up because I don't want to sit and wait for three hours for a website to load and wonder if the application even got in. So I don't actually... And then that one was posted on like the like (ph) Archives listserv thing anyways so a bunch of other archivists were also applying. So... <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F2\">I think it wasn't the end of the world not to apply for it. And it was... And it wasn't something that I was like really, really excited about. So... I think, yeah, I think slow websites counts as like a legitimate reason to not apply to something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: Well it's your list. So... (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: I mean... And I applied to something else that day so I was... So I still fulfilled my one a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: Well let's keep going with that because that's working to at least get you moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's not really working to get me past...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: It hasn't gotten you a job yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess... My dad sent to me the e-mail. It was like, \"Oh, give your resume to this person. Her husband might have, might know things about a job.\" You know, thinking about my dad I was like, \"What the hell?\" Like... But I didn't say anything. All I did was wrote the person sent her <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B1\">my resume and told her like, \"I'm his daughter. Blah, blah, blah...\" And she said she would send it to her husband. I don't really know what kind of job. Like a lead on a job. Like what does that... In my field? Outside my field? Admin assistant thing? Retail? I don't know. Like he gave me absolutely <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B2\">no information and like and does this person even actually want me to send the resume? But I... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: But instead of engaging in an argument with your dad...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I could have sent it and then engaged in an argument with my dad but I didn't. I just sent the resume. And the woman was like, \"Oh yes. I'll forward it to my husband.\" And I haven't heard anything since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: You weren't harmed in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: Other than being annoyed at my dad being... Like when he sends me stupid things that make no sense like internship, internship that doesn't mention anything about being paid at like this Jewish girls school which has absolutely has nothing to do with my field. Also it's all the way out in nowhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201331\">and then like then I'd have to drive. And it's... I don't know. Like if an internship doesn't say it's paid and doesn't say it's unpaid, is the assumption ? or is there not an assumption you can make? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it's worth asking a question because I don't, I wouldn't know which to pick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah. If something were in my field or remotely close to what I want to be doing it would be one thing but it's like when my mom sends me jobs sometimes they at least make sense. But my dad sends me jobs; they never make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I think if there's, if there's an internship that interests you and it's unclear about whether or not it's a paid position, maybe worth a phone call or an e-mail...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: ...to find out if there is some sort of stipend or salary or something that goes along with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: But, you know, if you're not interested in doing the work...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: ...and you wouldn't apply for it if it were a paid position. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: Though if something is a paid position, don't you think it would be to their advantage to be like, \"This is a paid internship,\" because, you know, more people would be likely to apply if it were paid then unpaid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: I'm not willing to speculate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: Like if I had a paid internship to offer I would be like, \"Here is this internship. It is paid with a stipend with X amount of money,\" or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: I don't think people are lacking for responses. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: In this job market, the employer or the internship holder is not really at the burden of trying to get people to apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: But they might be trying to get good people to apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: I don't think it's worth your energy to debate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: Your goal is to get a job and you can spend a lot of energy trying to make an assessment or assumption about what the employer wants or has to offer...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: But you don't really know unless you ask. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: And is it okay to send that sort of e-mail to something? If...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: Sure. \"I'm interested in this position. I noticed that there was no compensation mentioned. Is compensation available for this position?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: Uh huh. (PAUSE) Yeah. I think that's (inaudible) compensation (inaudible) something listed a while ago. \"Like is it... Are you still taking applications?\" So I guess it wouldn't be much different than that. But, yeah, I don't know. Maybe I should step it up to two a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: If you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">THERAPIST: What if we say one with a bonus for two? Have you set up that incentive chart for yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">CLIENT: Nope. Have not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: So that, doing that would be one way maybe if there is two that are interesting, maybe if you had some sort of incentive and reward for yourself you might be more likely to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: So you see... You're having some of the same behavior that your boyfriend is having for different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: But my behavior affects him a lot less than his affects me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">THERAPIST: That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">CLIENT: And I'm applying to one job per week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">THERAPIST: Yes. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">CLIENT: And I don't see... Part of me thinks that the incentive... I guess because I'm just thinking maybe I don't deserve a trip if I don't have a job so why set up a system if I'm... You know, why get rewarded for, you know, writing an application a week or whatever if they don't actually result in <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B1\">me getting a job. Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2017A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Well... The way I think about it is what's the goal of the reward? The goal is not for you to go on a trip. The goal is to get you doing more things that benefit you and applying for jobs benefits you because it's the only way you're going to get a job. You're not going to get a job unless <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D1\">you apply. We know that no one application guarantees you a job also because we don't know the outcome of any of them. But if you're not applying, you're not getting a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">THERAPIST: So the goal of setting up the chart is that it gets you to do things that give you a chance at getting what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">THERAPIST: So if the chart gets you to apply to more things, to not let things that are possibilities slip by then it's doing it's job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">THERAPIST: It's not a freebie trip. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">CLIENT: No. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: But if setting that up for yourself, if setting up a certain number of applications and you get to go on the trip stops you from applying stops you from applying because you don't think you deserve the trip then that's not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: ...that's not helping you either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">THERAPIST: We need to find something that gets you to do something to help yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">CLIENT: Mm hmm. So far all I can really do is just guilt myself and hope...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: Does that help? Because you've felt really guilty for a long time. Sometimes motivates you. Sometimes I don't think it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">CLIENT: Maybe not. I mean, I've... I don't know. It's just hard. I'm also like a little bit sick and that makes it hard too. I guess just... I don't know. Maybe the... When there's something I want to do ? okay, I will just do this short job application first. Then do...\" Like I think more immediate...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Right. Works better for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">CLIENT: ...works better than something in the long term. But like I don't necessarily always have that there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">CLIENT: Like the day where I wanted to dye yarn and like I did that after I sent out the application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So maybe we could look for more things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess the other thing I could theoretically do is like dedicate one day a week for like spending, you know, eight hours of that day looking and applying for jobs and one day a week spent doing yarning stuff for my store, like dying things. Like... And then I'd only be working <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A71\">two days a week and the rest of the time I could do whatever and that would still be more than I was doing for either of those things. It's just that I sort of lack the discipline to... And I'm like, \"Okay. Or I could just do the one job a week which seems like a lot less than that and...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Is there anyone in your daily life that could help hold you accountable to something that you set up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">CLIENT: I don't know. Like maybe Sydney could in theory. I don't know if he would. I could ask him. But like something's also are location based. Like I can only do... I can only dye yarn if I'm at my place and not when I'm at his place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">THERAPIST: But you can be at your place whenever you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: Sort of. I mean, yes and no. Like I can borrow his car and just go there but like if we were like, \"Oh, we're going to sleep at my place tonight,\" then it's like, \"Oh, I'm too sick to go over,\" and then I'm like, \"Okay, fine. We stay at your place another night and, you know...\" It's a lot harder <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF1\">to motivate myself to go over to my place and dye yarn then to already by at my place and then dye yarn because it's a whole like fifteen minute drive to my place and then I have to drive back. I guess it's not that long of a drive but like it's still... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like a very long commute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, assuming not rush hour. But it's enough to stop me from just doing it. I mean, that also could be the... I mean, I have gone to my place for a few hours and dyed yarn. So... (PAUSE) I don't know. I could apply for jobs when I'm at his place and dye yarn when I'm at my place or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B31\">But as of yet, I haven't gotten a good system to motivate myself other than the, you know, I will apply to one job a week system which... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Well that's been working the past couple weeks so it sounds like sticking with that and not changing that but if you want to add something to it. Now that you've done it successfully a couple weeks in a row...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">THERAPIST: ...you could maybe add something to it but I wouldn't take away something that's working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. But right now I'm like having trouble finding a job for to apply to this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">THERAPIST: This week. Well it's Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">CLIENT: It's Monday. That's true. But I usually try to get it done early in the week so I can enjoy the rest of the week. Yeah. I really don't know what else to do though. It's either that or (inaudible) or possibly maybe I could go back to volunteering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">THERAPIST: You could do that a couple hours a week in addition to applying for a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">THERAPIST: It gets you... I mean, one of the things I heard you say earlier is maybe one thing that would help with Sydney is actually being, having your day be a little bit less dependent on him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C9\">THERAPIST: And I wonder if having, you know, setting up some time to go to a place to go to separate from him that you're not reliant upon him being up at a certain time for you to go...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD\">THERAPIST: ...if that might, if that might actually feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">CLIENT: It might. And then I'll get out of the house and like at least be doing something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You get out of the house. You see someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Not that I'm necessarily that productive, but that's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">THERAPIST: But you get up and out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">THERAPIST: And I think having a little bit of structure, having a place to be, even if it's... Volunteering is a wonderful thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just don't want to volunteer forever...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DD\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DF\">CLIENT: ...because that would drive me insane.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E1\">THERAPIST: No. You don't want to only volunteer forever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">CLIENT: Like I could volunteer on top of a job depending on what that job is. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Right now volunteering wouldn't really getting in the way of something else. You have time to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E7\">CLIENT: It's just annoying that I don't have something else to do.

Fields are moving differently and your field is one where it's not really being helped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\">CLIENT: I feel really stupid. Like maybe I shouldn't have gone into like library science and archives. Maybe I should have completely changed my focus to something more practical that like actually has jobs. But the things that do have jobs are like, you know... I don't even know. Anything... At this <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201F31\">point any further education is only going to make me overqualified for things in my field and like I can't like start another bachelor's degree to like get a degree in computer science or something because that would be really expensive and I don't really like programming because I'm not very good at <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201F32\">it. But like I don't know what else to do or like, you know, go get an associate's degree because maybe that would make me better at getting administrative assistant jobs. Who goes and gets an associates degree after they're already gone to masters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">THERAPIST: These seem like somewhat illogical threads to be following. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">CLIENT: I don't know. Just like sending one job application a week isn't really working either. I need to like think outside the box and do something crazy but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">THERAPIST: I think thinking outside the box is a good idea. But thinking about pursuing a different degree that you're not interested in seems like a little bit much of an investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just wondering if... Well, I don't know. I just also don't think I'm... Unless it was a PhD program that had a stipend I don't think I could justify going for another degree because they would cost money even if there was something that would like, you know, if I want to get a museum studies <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB1\">degree as well that would cost money. And I've used up all the money in my college fund at this point so I am not entitled to any more degrees. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">CLIENT: Unless I got a PhD in museum curatorship and that which case... That would help me for another four or five years and then come out and have even possibly a tougher time finding a job. I don't know. It's like really unfortunate.

And they say they don't get to see the applications or anything until it's like whatever stage, you know, maybe like the last round of interviews or something. Or at least, you know, it would be after initial interviews definitely and not like so... They wouldn't necessarily <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202092\">be able to pull my name from the pile. Unless I somehow I guess... If I knew someone who was friends with someone who was in the HR Department at the school. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20208-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20208-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020B\">I think that would be the only way. I don't know anyone who is friends with people in HR and I don't really know the people in HR and they like to keep all that information top secret and stuff. So the networking thing I think... You know, yeah, I don't know people who work in other libraries that I'd <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2020B1\">want to work in or... Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Do you know that the people that you know in libraries don't know people in the field that don't work at the same libraries?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">CLIENT: That might... I don't know. It's also been a while since I've like talked to any of the people. You know, and really the only people at is the Divinity (ph) school library that was because I, you know, volunteer there. I guess also the (inaudible) that we gave to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">THERAPIST: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">CLIENT: If I see a job there I could like talk to the people but it's like until I see that job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20215\">THERAPIST: But so generally when people think of networking they think about the first step not knowing where the other steps are going to lead. That's what networking is. Right? It's one piece leading to the next piece which leads to the next piece and not knowing where those pieces are going with <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202151\">the hope that something will lead to something productive. And you're jumping a couple steps ahead. You're jumping to, \"Well, I know this person but they can't do this very one specific thing for me get me a job at the school.\" And when you think about networking what you really want to think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202152\">is a branch of networks that are all interconnected and you don't know which one goes where. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20217\">You start with the one piece you know and ask them to cast a wide net and then you hope that someone in that net, if they don't have something that works for you, they cast a wide net and that's what networking is. It's connecting people from different places to the mutual benefit of those two people <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202171\">that end up connecting in a new network and you're... When you think about it you're daunted by the fact that you don't see exactly how it's going to work but that's really what networking is, is that you don't know exactly how it's going to work. You start the process and hope however illogically that <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202172\">something's going to come from it. And lots of people do that. It's not a burden necessarily to the person that you first ask. They don't have to do much work and the next person doesn't have to do a lot of work. Everyone does a little something. I know it's uncomfortable for you. When you think out the... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20219\">CLIENT: It seems like I'm begging, you know? \"Please give me a job or talk to someone...\" Especially because (inaudible) you know, it's one thing to talk to the person you know and ask if they can like ask for you. You know, they can vouch for me but like the next person in that line doesn't know me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B\">THERAPIST: But they're not vouching for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F\">THERAPIST: That's not, that's not... The question isn't, \"Can you get me a job?\" The conversation is, \"Hey. I... Remember me? We worked together at blah, blah, blah,\" if that's how far back you need to go or, \"Stopped in. Just wanted to let you know I've been looking for a position in this field. Thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F1\">I'd let you know in case you knew of anything.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2021E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098418\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20221\">And then they get to take that where they want. They can say, \"Sorry to hear you've been looking for a while. I don't know of anything,\" or they can say, \"Oh, I don't know. But my friend is friends with whoever. (LAUGHTER) I'll drop her an e-mail.\" That's not a lot of effort for that person to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20223\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20225\">THERAPIST: Or, \"Oh, I saw in my Twitter feed that such and such is hiring.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20227\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20229\">THERAPIST: You know, they may not have to do much more than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2022B\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2022D\">CLIENT: I guess if I can find the least scary people to e-mail that... If I had... Because a lot of people I might be like, \"Oh, it's been so long time since (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So let's add that to your list. One application this week...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20231\">CLIENT: And one networking thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20233\">THERAPIST: ...and the least scary networking thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20235\">CLIENT: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20237\">THERAPIST: Send the least scary e-mail and, and it doesn't... You don't need to beg for a job. You want to start at the reintroduction. Think about it as a reconnecting and just letting people know you're out there. You're out there looking. You're not asking them to do a specific thing for you. You're <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202371\">not expecting a particular response. You're reconnecting and letting them know you're looking so that... And think about who might be possible and it's absolutely fine to start with the least scary person. Set the bar at an achieveable goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20239\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Is that doable or is that too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2023D\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2023F\">THERAPIST: I have faith in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20241\">CLIENT: I guess I might substitute second least scary networking thing if I can't actually find a job to apply to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20243\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20245\">CLIENT: Because so far I haven't found anything to apply to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20247\">THERAPIST: Okay. That seems fair. So either one job and the least scary or least scary and tack on another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20249\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, it will probably be a very similar e-mail. Just changing the name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024D\">CLIENT: Yeah or well name and where they might be from...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20251\">CLIENT: ...because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20253\">THERAPIST: Right. But I mean the, the hard part, the letting them know you've been looking is probably the harder part to craft than the, \"Hello so and so.\" So I have faith in you. You can do scary things if you can get through panic attacks, which we know you can, you can do this too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20255\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20257\">THERAPIST: I will see you next week at the regular time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20259\">CLIENT: Okay. Still nothing from the insurance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025B\">THERAPIST: I actually got back... They needed an extra code that they don't usually need so I resubmitted it with an additional code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025F\">THERAPIST: So we're back to starting over again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20261\">CLIENT: Okay so wait. Another six weeks sort of thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20263\">THERAPIST: Let's hope that it's not but it might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20265\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20267\">THERAPIST: But it's not a denial. It was just a like, \"Hey, we need a little more information to process this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20269\">CLIENT: That's good that it wasn't a denial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026D\">CLIENT: That makes me grateful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
