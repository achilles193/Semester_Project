The insurance has changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, I got your e-mail that you had sent me with the information awhile ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Do you mean the bill or do you mean something else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: The like instructions about the new or like a bill, I guess.

(LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Because it was explaining the new like situation with the copay and everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right. So things turned out to be a little different that what I had thought. Not in a bad way, just in an administratively different way.

And then I would just bring a copay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: There's a few ways you can do it actually. One thing that I forgot to mention to you is if you want... With some people, I'm writing down, I'm taking a picture actually of their credit card and then I'll just bill each week for the copay so we don't have to take time here to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I'm happy to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That's probably easiest for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Or if you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: That's easiest for me too probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Will that work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Okay.

I can send you an e-mail with the exact amount over the weekend. Or actually what will probably be easier is I'll tell you about what it would be right now.

So, so I had told you last week I think about that big argument I had with Stephanie (ph) about my birthday. So last night I went to dinner with her, Aidan (ph), and Lucas (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: And we were sitting at the table and, I don't know, I ran my hand over it and like did this or something and like ran my hand over where I had bumped my head. And it still hurts a little. Like it's still a little painful, you know. And I like just said something out loud like, \"I can't believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D1\">it's still... Like it's still healing,\" or something like that, \"Still hurts a little,\" or something. And then Aidan said something to the effect of like, \"Should we go... Do we need to go to the hospital?\" Which indicated obviously Stephanie had told him about like this thing that we had, right? So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D2\">I was like, \"No.\" And I was like, \"Nope. Already went. It's taken care of,\" like making light of it. And then he was like, he was like... And then he started it like, \"I mean, we didn't know. We didn't know.\" And I was like, \"It's all good. All's well that ends well.\" And then Stephanie, on the side <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D3\">of me, \"See you're doing it again.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">And I'm like, \"What?\" She's like, \"Saying that kind of stuff and then Jillian (ph) told me at the restaurant that you didn't even tell her about the Benadryl. Something's weird. Like what's up with that?\" And I was like, \"Stephanie. Like...\" She's like, like attacking me again. And Aidan and Lucas are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F1\">sitting there like awkward. Aidan's just kind of sitting there. Lucas is like inclined stick up for me but like also doesn't really want to get involved. And I was like, \"I think we should just drop it. Like there's nothing really more to talk about. Like I don't even know... I didn't tell Jillian about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F2\">the Benadryl? I don't know. Okay. Whatever. Like...\" (PAUSE) And then I asked Jillian. She was like... I was like, \"Why did Stephanie just bring up something that you guys discussed about my birthday and used it against me in like a really confrontational way.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">And she was like, \"Was it the Benadryl?\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" She was like, \"Ah, I knew it.\" And she was like, \"I don't know. I mean, I don't remember saying anything about that.\" But I'm like, \"But who cares? It's irrelevant.\" And I'm like, \"I don't know why she's fixated on this, on the Benadryl, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A11\">on the whole thing.\" She's like, \" I don't know. Maybe she feels guilty.\" I'm like, \"Okay. But we talked about it and we had this thing last week. Like why is she hung up on this and why would she like then...\" What does she think, there's some conspiracy theory like that I didn't tell Jillian about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A12\">the Benadryl and something's weird about that. You were talking about it with me but... I mean, so? Maybe I fucking forgot. Maybe Jillian forgot. Maybe... Like who cares? It's irrelevant. The whole thing is irrelevant. It's over. And why is she fixated on this Benadryl issue? Like because she doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A13\">want to feel guilty at all like for not like watching how much I drank or whatever? I don't know. But it's really like, \"kay, enough. Can we move on, Stephanie?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098946\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">Like... And literally, she was... The all's well that ends well. I think she felt it was similar to water under the bridge that she got so infuriated at. But all's well that ends well. Like... It's just a saying. There's nothing malicious behind my saying it. I'm literally saying, \"We're all set now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">Everything's fine. Everybody's happy. Nobody's mad. Why are you still mad?\" I don't know why... And it's very disruptive. I literally was inclined to get up and walk out. And I was like, \"Fuck. We're in Aidan's car tonight. I can't leave.\" But I probably would have left if I had my car. I would have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A32\">been like, \"Maybe I'll come pick you after you guys are done.\" Like I really... There was no reason for me to stay here and have to be attacked like this. \"It feels like brutal, Stephanie. Like we're in a restaurant and you're like in my face like... Why wouldn't you just wait to bring it up later maybe? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A33\">Like, \u2018At the restaurant when you said that...' Like instead of calling me out in front of people, embarrassing me.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">Like it was very... I don't know. I don't really know what to think about that and then like everything's fine after. Well then she accused me of having a weird vibe and then I took out my phone and I was being all weird. And of course I was being weird because I was fucking heated. But I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A51\">I was like, \"What are you talking about? Like no. I... My phone vibrated. I took it out. We're fine. Like did we drop it? Did we move on.\" And then afterwards... No. And then I got annoyed at Lucas because like Stephanie was like, \"La, la, la, la, la, la,\" in my face, in my face. And then she finishes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A52\">her thing. I'm like literally like, \"Okay. We can drop it now.\" Like not saying anything. And then Lucas's sitting there and he's watching it all take place and he's like, \"I need to go to law school. Ha, ha, ha.\" And then Stephanie's like, \"Ha, ha, ha.\" And she's totally like satisfied with herself <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A53\">because he said that, you know, because she's a lawyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: So he's like, \"Oh.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Because she's like<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah, chewed you out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right. And I said, \"No, that was really shitty. Like, really?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: And he was like, \"Well, you know, I mean, I didn't want like just like be only sticking up for you. Like whatever.\" I was like, \"Then, don't get involved. Like, do you understand what just happened?\" And he was like, \"Wait. So she was catching a weird vibe? Oh, you convinced me that there really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B51\">was no weird vibe. Good job.\" (LAUGHTER) I was like, hopefully I convinced her because I didn't want to fucking deal with her. Because not only is she yelling at me about the birthday. Then she's accusing, attacking me for giving a weird vibe and being weird. \"Like Stephanie, it doesn't resonate at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B52\">all with you that maybe I'm giving a weird vibe because you just verbally attacked me like at a dinner table? Could it be that maybe that's why and maybe you shouldn't attack me again to like prolong the weirdness?\" Like... She's at this is how she's been for our entire friendship and this is why we <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B53\">weren't friends for so long. And honestly I don't care anymore so if she had been serious and if she really wants to be mad at me about something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098946\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">Like... And if she brings up this birthday thing again, I'm really... It's... I'm not participating in her conversation. I told Jillian, I was like, \"Listen, if she brings up to you if anything was said at dinner, like please, please do me the favor of don't, of not... Just say, \u2018I don't want to discuss <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">it,\" or say, \u2018Eh. You know, it's okay. We don't have to talk about it,\" or whatever. Just because like it's not... It doesn't need to be talked about anymore. It's okay. Whatever. Like... I was really mad at her. It's like she has to be like... I don't know. It's like she's very judgemental or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B72\">I don't know. And I got really mad. And then (SIGH) last weekend... God. Was it Friday or Saturday that we decided to go out? We like went to one place where there was a really long line and we left. We went to another area where it was all long lines. Then we decided, \"Oh, let's go down to that place <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B73\">that's down by the waterfront because they haven't been there and whatever. So we go down there. There's parking, which is great. We walk it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">It's an older crowd, which is, oh, we realized it's an older crowd and we understand why because of the location. Student like... Younger people that live in the city aren't going to come all the way over there, like don't have cars or whatever. But like the lighting was weird in this bar. It was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">too bright. And it's like... The layout was really weird and it was loungy with just like kind of lounge generic kind of music, kind of housey (ph) music, you know, whatever. And it looked like it might be kind of a fun place with a group maybe. But, but all the people were unattractive. Like they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B92\">all unattractive. Maybe some of the girls were attractive and the only attractive guys were with the attractive girls. So... Or yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: I had a drink, which I only drank like half of because it was a cocktail that was sweet. You know, I was like, \"Meh.\" Which is good though because like I wasn't like, I didn't like chug it and then want another. So that's fun. Stephanie goes up to the bar to get herself a second drink and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">like shimmies in like, in this spot that's like kind of between where these two guys are sitting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">One of them is like short, like shorter than us, like in our heels and like out of shape and like tiny hands that like when Stephanie was like... Well so... And his friend was like a fucking caveman. Like I don't even know. Like gross. I'm like forty. I don't even understand. So she like starts conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">with them because she's getting her drink there. Like she just... This is what she does. She talks to these fucking losers just because she's bored.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: So then she's standing there for like... First of all... And then we like we get introduced. The short one has like really soft tiny hands that like I wanted to vomit and then the other one had really ugly fingernails. Hands have like been a thing for me. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Actually Stephanie used to get really angry at me because I'd like completely rule people out from talking to them because I didn't like their hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098946\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: It's a thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I guess so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: But anyway, so that already and then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Soft hands or little hands?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah and like or ugly fingernails and hands or just like... And then the Neanderthal one just held on way too long to the point that I literally yanked my hand away. Like, \"I've had enough of touching you.\" Like... And then he's like, \"Ooh.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: So Stephanie's standing there for twenty minutes while I'm like standing on the sideline being like bitchy friend. I guess neutral, my mom said I should be if I neutral, my mom said, it I don't want to talk to them. But then it was bitchy because I was annoyed because she's standing there chit <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">chatting with these losers who I know she has no interest in. The neanderthal one smells like cinnamon and it' like making me want to throw up. And then Stephanie's like... So then we started talking about it after and she's like, \"No. Because I'm bored and I just want to talk to whoever will talk to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D72\">me.\" And I'm like, \"I'm the opposite. I don't want to talk to anybody unless I am attracted to them or there's something that's (inaudible) and she's like, \"Gosh. There's got to be...\" And her thing is like she's just too, \"Like, oh, I'll talk to anybody. Who knows.\" And I'm like, \"I'm not going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D73\">talk to anybody.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: And we're like... There has to be a middle...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: ...area there...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: ...that we haven't figured out because she does talk to these guys and then like... Because I'm like explaining to her, I'm like, \"Stephanie, but then they think you're interested. If you're not interested and you're doing it just because you're bored, they don't know that. They're like, \u2018Wow. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">This girl just came up and started talking to me out of the blue for twenty minutes and now we're exchanging business cards. Cool,' like hello. You know? And then I'm as your friend, then it's like they are like, \u2018Oh maybe they're both interested in talking to us,' and then I have to like play the sidelines <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E32\">when you're not even... I would play the sidelines with an ugly friend if you were actually interested in the person you were not talking to.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: \"I'm not going to play sideline with the ugly friend that you're not interested in the person you're talking to.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: I mean, it's just not... It doesn't make any sense. I would never ask her to do that, you know? So it was kind of a bust. I mean, I think it was a successful night because we kept like pushing forward when we had no success with a couple bars. We were like, \"Let's keep on trying.\" So we ended <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">up and we went out and we didn't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm. \"This was a good college try.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Right (inaudible) crowd was shitty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: But we're going to try this area again actually this weekend. A different bar. And, you know, see how that goes. And in the meantime, I want to hear back from one of these jobs. Well, I heard back from the really low paying one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: That I didn't get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Which is great. They made the decision for me. Fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: Then I haven't heard back from the one I Skyped interviewed with yet. And then I applied...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: That was the executive assistant one?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098946\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: ...followed up twice now. One with... First with an e-mail then with a voice-mail this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: Then last... I had also applied last week for another position, an assistant position. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: And I had e-mailed that woman that I've been in touch with...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: ...at the university who's in development and asked her about the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Who you spoke with last year. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I asked her about the position and she said I should apply. So hopefully that means she going to help get my resume towards the top of the pile. We'll see. I mean, you never know because they could have internal candidates. You know? But anyway, I followed up with them this week via <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201171\">e-mail just to reiterate my interest in the position. And then I applied for a couple more positions. One, for a manager of grants that's really close. And another one for Executive Assistant also. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">So there seems to be a lot of job openings that are kind of popping open, popping up so I'm just going to keep applying, you know, and hope to hear something soon I guess. And then in the meantime, in the meantime... So Lucas every year is involved with the... He's involved with the Community Center, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201191\">the center here in town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: Because his dad has like always lived down around there and he's a big part of it. So Lucas's always been involved. And every year they have a... Well, this will be the eighth year. And they have the Children's Festival which is a free festival in the community. It's basically to raise money <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D1\">for the community center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Where is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: The downtown district.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, I know where that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: Like all of that area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: And it's like, the whole place is like the community center is, and the museum, the museum is in at trying to restore an actual community because it's only a neighborhood really and it's a lot transient with the doctors and the big condos and the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: So that's the kind of goal to restore it as a community that area because it was part of the urban... Shit. What is it? Something like redevelopment or something like that in the mid last century where they kind of like tore down all these kind of like tenement type housing where there was a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D1\">lot of families and things like that and (inaudible) big immigrant neighborhood. Actually, Jews were, besides, I think, Irish and Italian, the other, like the second biggest population in the area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Like... And a pretty much... It was like a big Jewish central area up until like World War II or something like that, or past it or something like that. But anyway, so because it's like all been changed down there, it's just like... They're trying to keep it... So this Community, the Children's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201311\">Festival, Lucas needed a co director and so I'm going to do it with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: And I'm really excited because it's a really good part of my, I don't know, resume or cover letter or whatever because I'm doing fundraising and it's going to be really excellent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) as well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: No. He doesn't. Just for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2013A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098946\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">CLIENT: So but he...

But she's in college and she's a senior and she's going to be applying for jobs and this is in the summer that it happens. So she's not... She didn't want to do it again. She already has it on her resume <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201411\">and everything. So... And she did, was responsible for all the fundraising end of stuff and some of the other organizational things. And I mean, this is like right up my alley and in terms of the actual like sponsors and repeat sponsors and vendors and all that stuff...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: ...it's kind of like just like driving a ship...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: ...like in terms of what I would have to do to back management wise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: And this is what I do for a living so this is...

So that's really exciting. That's something that is going to take up a lot of time which is great because we were talking about, you know, like not knowing how to be alone and not having so many activities that I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: So this is going to be really great for me.

So that's next week and then the weekend after that is my little brother's bar mitzvah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: Which is going to be a whole weekend of stuff just because...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20176-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20176-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098946\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">CLIENT: ...my stepmom's family is in and people are here from Chicago and the whole thing. And then the weekend after that I... Looks like I might be going on a trip with my stepmom ad my little brother and maybe my older brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">CLIENT: Because... So we have family there because that's like where the (inaudible) went like first...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">CLIENT: ...from like Austria and Poland, I guess. Then they also went to... Then obviously some came to... Like my grandmother and her sister came to Chicago. Some like ended up in Israel. And then some ended up in France, actually. And then we have in England a bunch of people that are my dad's first <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201831\">cousins and stuff. And then... So his cousins have kids now and one of them has twins, boy and girl. And they're more religious so the girls don't get bat mitzvahed but the boy does and so Connor (ph), his bar mitzvah is the weekend after Jesse's bar mitzvah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">CLIENT: So I think we're planning on going. Well I guess my dad... We weren't really sure and I guess that we want to do it but my dad is not sure he can... Listen to how weird this is. He's not sure if he can go because he has a patient who apparently has a lot of problems or something and it's that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201871\">weekend is the... The time of the trip would coincide with the anniversary of an abortion she had like years ago that every year, they like light a candle and like say some words of rememberance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: You mean he does with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: And he like is not sure that he can leave because it's this weekend. It's like over that time. I was like, \"What?\" He was like, \"Because I have this patient.\" I was like, \"Well what do you mean you can't leave?\" He was like, \"Well because she had abortion...\" Or like I didn't understand. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F1\">like, \"Oh, well that makes sense, I guess. You want to be there just in case she likes freaks out. He he was like, \"No, no, no. She already had it years ago. She just...\" And I was like, \"What the fuck?\" And then I was like thinking about my own situation and I was like, \"Oh my God. Like I'm really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F2\">kind of... I don't have that kind of attachment to the fucking abortion where you like named the baby. Like... And do like a remembrance ceremony with your shrink.\" I'm sorry. I know I'm like being an asshole. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: Like it sounds a little fucking nuts. Like maybe... Well thank God probably she didn't have the kid in that case (inaudible) well anyway. So he might not be able to go so I guess he's now offering it up. And I'm like, \"Really?\" The tickets are nine hundred bucks. He's like, \"Yeah. Whatever.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201931\">I'm like, \"Dude. So you're going to spend fucking seven grand on us to go to England. Spend that on my credit card. Buy me a house.\" (LAUGHTER) I mean, not really because obviously I would go on the trip. But it's just like this is how he is with his money. It's very like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: Capricious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: Uh huh. He'll like spend x amount on this but then he's like so frugal on other ends of things. I don't know. I mean, in a certain sense, it's like, yeah, no one I learned how to spend that way and now I have credit card debt. Because it's like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: I think you may be on kind of a tear.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20198-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20198-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098946\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">CLIENT: What do you mean?

Well I am feeling critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">CLIENT: I mean, I almost feel bored and so like easy to be really critical of everybody I talk to because I'm really irritable because I'm bored. I mean, I'm less bored now with this Children's Festival thing because it does give me something else to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: But at the same time, right now I'm... There's not much I can do with it like right this second. We're going to the community center tomorrow to look at look over files and get templates and look over the budget and we have a meeting with the... Apparently it's a compensated thing too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Like I just... (PAUSE) And I mean, okay, so like at work, right? There's this like Brazil trip coming up that like I should be excited for. I mean, I think I'm kind of not because I'm also applying for jobs and so I'm not really sure... And I'm feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C31\">nervous about, Okay, it's getting to the time where we're going to have to buy our tickets.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">CLIENT: And I'm like getting nervous about committing to that whether or not I get a job...

But then there's still the issue of I'm then leaving as soon as they've paid for this big trip...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\">CLIENT: ...for me. So it's nerve wracking either way. And then we have another conference, a big, big conference coming up next fall that we have to really start probably planning for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">But those two things aren't like keeping me going because I still on top of those things have all this day to day bullshit that I've been doing and I'm so sick of that's the bulk of what I do. You know what I mean? Where these isolated trips to Brazil, big conference coming up are more isolated but <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D11\">are also still more of the same in essence, you know? Another big conference, more nametag. Like, I don't know. Maybe it's just because I'm just bored with the place that I'm at, I guess. Because I still want to be doing these events. I just want to be doing them somewhere else or for somebody else <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D12\">or at a different department or with different people or something. You know what I'm saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.

I have to take care of everything on my own as usual. Like I'm doing everything and taking care of everything as usual.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">CLIENT: And I'm just antsy in general. (PAUSE) And like I'm tired of like being the only one that like cleans my house. Like it's not even like I'm living with a boyfriend anymore. Now like a grown woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">THERAPIST: Still just you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">CLIENT: You know she used four rolls of toilet paper over the weekend for her nose that was running because she was sick? Like this goes hand in hand with the using of my toothpaste. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">It's like, \"Dude. Like buy some fucking tissues, A. And B, like four rolls? Really, really?\" I think probably throughout the week she probably used six or seven. Like I... Like they kept going. And I was like, kept refilling the toilet paper thing. Like, what the fuck? And finally she must have hoarded <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202571\">three rolls in her room. And then finally I saw she bought some tissues but like... It was just kind of like... This is not... I mean... And the drawer's still stuck. Did I tell you about the stuck drawer? There's a drawer that's stuck, a utensil drawer. And I've lived in that apartment for two and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202572\">a half, over two and a half years and I've never gotten that fucking drawer stuck and it's now stuck and she was the one that got it stuck and because it wasn't stuck the last time I used it and I was... This drawer has got me like so worked up because I cannot for the life of me get it open. Like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202573\">was like slamming it. Like yanking it. Like I don't care what I break right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">Like I just want to open the fucking drawer. And I'm so irritated at the roommate and everything... And she like... Eww. She must have had dishes in her room. She had like all these tupperware containers that were in the sink and had mold in them. I was like, \"Really?\" And the toothpaste. She's using <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202591\">my toothpaste. And she used the butter again except for this much. Like all of it. So that's also why I'm antsy because I don't necessarily want to be at home. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">THERAPIST: I think you're antsy and you don't want to be at home because you don't want to totally lose your shit at her or at something house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">THERAPIST: Like I think you're, I think you're infuriated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">CLIENT: Yeah. I am. But like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">THERAPIST: And worried about not being able to control it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">THERAPIST: ...and lose it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">CLIENT: And I'm also not good at approaching these kind of situations. I always end up sounding somehow bitchy or too like authoritative or something.

Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026F\">THERAPIST: ...the cognitive abilities to figure out how to approach these situations. I think you could maybe get carried away because you're so God damned angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20271\">CLIENT: Well and because it's so dumb.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20273\">THERAPIST: You feel very, and I'm not saying correctly, but feel very righteous. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20275\">CLIENT: But I also feel petty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20277\">THERAPIST: ...taken advantage, taken advantage of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20279\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, for sure. But I also feel really petty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B\">THERAPIST: You do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D\">CLIENT: Because it feels like I really have to talk to a twenty nine year old woman about like, \"Do you need more toothpaste?\" Like I... Like, \"Please let me know if you're going to use my toothpaste.\" It just seems so fucking retarded. Like... I mean, obviously she's using the toothpaste so I'm going <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D1\">to what? Be like, \"Oh. Are you using my toothpaste?\" Or like, \"Did you run out of toothpaste.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027F\">Like... And then it's like, \"Oh, yeah. I figured that was cool.\" And then it's like, what? Like, \"Yeah. It's cool if you tell me ahead of time.\" I mean, I bought it if we really want to be specific. I also bought the toilet paper which she's probably going to replace with some like organic one ply cardboard shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20281\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) (inaudible) crap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20283\">CLIENT: Like... (SIGH) Just it's... You don't... We don't have that level of a relationship. That's what it is. We're not friends. We're not like longtime roomies where this has like been established and this is how we've been doing things. Like if there's something new that's going to start happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202831\">in terms of the sharing, I think you should ask. I mean, like, I used her half and half one morning and literally sent her a text message, like, \"Hey, Mindy. I used some of your half and half. I hope that's okay.\" Just because I would want somebody to say it to me in which case I would say, \"Of course!\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20285\">And then maybe it's established moving forward that's fine. I mean, she did finally say like, \"Yeah, I meant to tell you...\" Like because I like asked her if I could use some of her salt. She was in the kitchen. She was like, \"Yeah, I meant to tell you (inaudible) in terms of like dishes, I figured <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202851\">like if there's something... I've just been washing whatever's in there.\" I was like, \"Yeah, me too. Like perfect.\" She was like, \"Mostly, you know, I've been using your olive oil. I have another one in there (inaudible)we can start once that one's done and, you know, like...\" And I think I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202852\">\"Yeah. That's cool. No problem. And the butter... And I saw the butter,\" or something like that. Like I threw it in somehow. But like this is why it's so awkward because like we can have those kinds of discussions but ahead of time not when you left me this much butter and not said anything to me or <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202853\">not replaced it ever. And then I replaced it and then you used it again until it was almost up.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20287\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20289\">CLIENT: The toothpaste thing is weird. Like it just... Because we started with her buying it. She had her own toothpaste and then she ran out and it was like (inaudible) here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028B\">THERAPIST: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">CLIENT: And she doesn't like take the initiative to like clean. Like is she just sees like... Like the floor has crap all over it. I just... So swiffer it. Like... I don't know. It is infuriating when I don't know how to approach it because I will lose my shit or just sound really awkward or downplay <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F1\">it too much because I'm trying not to lose my shit and then it just... I'm like... It's just weird. So that's what I'm kind of going with like I just would rather not say anything.

(SIGH) It's just another device for him to be really creepy and flirt with girls online. (LAUGHTER) I'm sure. Well, I had found a Twitter account that he was Twitter creeping. He had a Twitter account and was like flirting... Like I saw him flirting messages with this girl that <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202B31\">stayed with us when she was in town because she was there for a dance, like in Hungary. Retarded. And I found the Twitter and there was some picture of him like in the mirror with the cell phone like without a shirt like fresh out of the shower with his fucking abs like, \"Almost at my goal. Like one <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202B32\">more month and I'll be there.\" And I got infuriated because A, yeah, now that you're not with me you're like... Not that he was to work out to look good in general. Like... Well it just made me look bad. Like... And who puts fucking... You're twenty nine years old and you're putting shirtless pictures <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202B33\">on the Internet. Really Franklin? And I also got infuriated because it looks like he has an iphone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B5\">Like it looks like an iphone and I just bought him that God damned Samsung Galaxy S3 in August.

Give me <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202B51\">that money. I'm still fucking paying for it. (LAUGHTER) So that made me infuriated. It just like everything. The pictures of his food on the plates that I gave him. And I'm like, \"Oh, you delete all of our pictures but you're eating off of the plates that I provided you with.\" And like a picture of <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202B52\">a like a Celtics t shirt that was laid out on the bedspread that I bought him because his new room was too cold. Just like all that. And that got me really mad.
