It was really bad, like just throwing up is the worst. So the current plan is not to get James sick. Apparently you remain contagious for several days after you feel better so \u2013 I am doing my best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Couples counseling today didn\u2019t go that well. Stuff that was important to talk about, but I didn\u2019t really feel better at the end of the session. It was sort of grimly funny to me that I spend so much thought and energy and anxiety about wanting to take care of James and trying to do that and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">which he doesn\u2019t feel like I take care of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: You know that\u2019s what I do, you know, I can\u2019t do it for him and it really frustrates me. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night again because I basically was up all night on Friday throwing up and then just slept much of the day and all night on Saturday and then all night on Sunday, and like last night <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">I just couldn\u2019t sleep. So I just feel so worn out. I think James gets anxious and frustrated with me when he feels like I sort of throw up my hands and give up about something, and say, well \u2013 I just can\u2019t do that. I feel like I just give up provisionally. Well, I give up for now, and the next day the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">problem is still there, and I\u2019m still there and so I sort of try to tackle it again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It\u2019s weird how I\u2019m trying to frame it anyway, because I\u2019m still not giving up. I mean well, I\u2019ll just give up for the night, I just give up right now<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(The therapist says something \u2013 inaudible) 00:05:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to say well, things will probably get better or I probably do have the resources or this probably will be okay. What if I am just so short and it\u2019s not and so it ends up with me just kind of taking everything inside me, that\u2019s saying no, this is a disaster and I say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">well, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s real, or I know that\u2019s not real and I can\u2019t trust that. It\u2019s hard and I feel weird about it. (The client is crying softly) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like all my intuitions are wrong, so \u2013 (client crying softly) So I finally watched Glengarry Glen Ross the other day, funny that was what came to mind. Which I\u2019ve never seen before. Have you seen it? Oh, you should see it! I really liked seeing it. I think I like Mamet\u2019s short plays better <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">though. It\u2019s both like, brilliant and also just horrible, you know just horrible people, but it\u2019s so beautifully written. Yeah, it\u2019s really good. I think I was thinking that while I was walking, he\u2019s good at long walks. I don\u2019t think I would watch it again though. I did rewind to see the scene with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">Alec Baldwin. Alec Baldwin, he\u2019s like very young at the time, sort of at the peak of his hot person, career, has this great monologue at the opening that was written for him, for the movie. It wasn\u2019t in the original play. Where he\u2019s like the trainer coming in to tell these like these real estate salesmen <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">that they need to step it up and well, we\u2019re changing up the monthly promotional contest, like first prize is a new car, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is, your fired! It\u2019s worth the watching like that one five minute scene, actually you don\u2019t really even need to watch the rest of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F4\">the movie. (Laughing) all of the cultural references that I was missing are in that scene anyways. A large part of wanting to see it was like, everybody sort of refers back to it and I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562066\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m good, yeah. I\u2019ve been sort of yarn, of like to do with, but I\u2019m good, I\u2019m taking apart a couple of hats and a couple of sweaters that I made that I don\u2019t ever wear. I\u2019m going to use the yarn also, so I feel better about not to have so many things in my closet that aren\u2019t useful. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">actually is something I feel good about. I was pretty sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. There were about 12 hours where you think you\u2019re going to die and then 12 hours where you just don\u2019t want to move and then you\u2019re better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: It feels like, I know it isn\u2019t actually the way it it, but it feels like I can just wake up at any day and just have to move or I could wake up any day and have James leave me. Not even like those are irrational worse case fears, within the spectrum of possibility, I don\u2019t really know what to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">do with that. I can\u2019t fix it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: For like his job, I can talk with him about it and I do talk with him about it and ask him how it\u2019s going, I can\u2019t \u2013 I feel like the more, real part of taking care of James right now is not putting on him how anxious it makes me that he doesn\u2019t have a job yet. I\u2019m not anxious that he\u2019s not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">to find a job, I\u2019m just anxious because I\u2019ve been waiting to find out what we\u2019re going to do for the last six months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Your anxious not knowing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I feel like James has sort of said, okay, it\u2019s just around the corner, for at least the last six months. Basically April is when he started talking about flying or talking about flying like this is something that I need to be doing very, very soon or like in the near future. He works <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">from home, I\u2019ve seen him working, he works all the fucking time. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s not doing his part and it\u2019s not like I, but a part of him, sort of saying repeatedly doesn\u2019t trust me because he trusts me and I almost died or I almost killed myself and I am sort of like, well, that\u2019s just something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">you have to get over, like I\u2019ll talk to you about it, but talking is in my mind at least is like a lot of it is helping him get to the point where he decides whether or not he is going to trust me again. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re both working pretty hard in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I had an impression you know, it\u2019s a lot of times, a bit like out and out problem thing and you better really do it right or your fired. (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: But I also feel like a sort of emotional movement that is his, and like I can\u2019t make him do that. It\u2019s nothing that\u2019s fun to be the one waiting while he decides whether he\u2019s going to leave me. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s that dire, but I told him that it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: excruciating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It\u2019s pretty tough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I guess in a way I think maybe you\u2019re talking about two sort of like ways of dealing with all the insecurity, I guess if that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen with the two of you, well any which, you do work really hard, trying to take care of him and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating to be like, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">you\u2019re not doing or you\u2019re not too well enough or something, whatever the hell it is, and then another in which like this, you sort of sit and wait and it\u2019s excruciating and it feels like that most of the things that matter are on the line and there\u2019s nothing you can do. .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562066\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I have had enough of trying to sort of quiet my own mind, and I\u2019m really bad at that. It\u2019s pretty chaotic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: We have (inaudible)  I could be angry at myself because I do everything wrong sort of sit with the idea that normally there is not much that I can be doing or that \u2013 but I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t been cooking, because I have been sick, I am contagious. It\u2019s like this, sort of hilarious, I step back at it and I get very confused because do I feel guilty about not cooking or do I feel guilty about not being able to stay out of the kitchen. Like which should win (laughing) I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">they both win. I haven\u2019t cried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: It sort of feels like my house was destroyed in an earthquake and I have been sort of figuring out how to rebuild and had all the equipment and all this stuff and I couldn\u2019t start because there was some problem with zoning rights or some bullshit thing. That\u2019s really not fair to James. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like I said that and I immediately want to take it back because it\u2019s not fair to James and also it is sort of implying that I haven\u2019t already done the building which is not true, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Okay, let me make sure I\u2019m clear on the idea though. So the earthquake is the depression and you\u2019re re-building things with him, essentially re-building your life and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but also like figuring out my career path, and choices and like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s re-building your life for everything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: And James is I\u2019m gunning for it? Yes, okay. (Laughing in the background) Or he is gunning for it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, so like I was talking to a man at church last night, or after church and he had sort of worked for the government for awhile in electrical engineering I think and not doing that anymore but I started thinking well, you know I\u2019m working as a nanny and kind of looking out for the next thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">and I told him about languages and he said oh you should apply for this grant from the government to study a language that is important to national security and they require that you would be gone or 12-24 months and then you work for them for a couple of years. If I were single, that is something I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">would at least look into, like I would love to live abroad for a couple of years. I was like, no, that\u2019s not going to happen to James and that is a really good tradeoff for my point of my view, I am much happier being with James than I would be living abroad. I am not missing making those choices, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200553\">well, I am sort of missing being able to make those choices. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Maybe I am just fretting about the choices because I don\u2019t want to be fretting about James wanting to leave me. There\u2019s a John Milton poem and I feel like I may have mentioned it in here before, but the fun and the punch line is they also serve who only stand and root.

You know if you want me to take care of you, controlling the way I do things is not the way to make that happen. I was pretty angry at him about that spell, like we <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">were driving, getting into the car to drive back from seeing family at Christmas and he spent like 20 minutes packing the trunk and he wouldn\u2019t let anybody else help and he was, he had a system and he was getting really angry and frustrated because it wasn\u2019t fitting perfectly, but no one else can help <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">him pack the trunk.

He\u2019s been sort of like hyper vigilant about stuff like that, that you know it was like, I think he was really irritated with me for getting sick. Yes, maybe I could have prevented it myself from catching the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">stomach flu from the kids that I work with, but that would have involved not cooking their dinner and that would involve me not doing my job and that was the tradeoff that I decided on when I took this job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right, was the unprofessional hazard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Ok, well it sounds like at least for you, there\u2019s some way it feels like him always have to be taken incredibly seriously.

Done right in a sort of narrow sense, that doesn\u2019t really take into account everyone\u2019s feelings at the end of it. Or like the speed at which this happens or you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: I think a lot of these things like come down to, he just doesn\u2019t trust me. Trusting me to pick up my own prescriptions is not on the same scale as trusting me to not have to be hospitalized again. You know even that, I feel like it\u2019s sort of framing the problem in the wrong light. Yeah, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">not a slippery slope. I can pack the trunk.
