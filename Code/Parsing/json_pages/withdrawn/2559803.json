I\u2019m not exactly sure how their parents will feel about that offer. But whatever. You know, like they don\u2019t have any toy guns at all sort of thing.

(WHISPERING) It\u2019s something I want, whenever there\u2019s money and time, I want to take it back <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">up again. (PAUSE) Yeah. Yeah. It was a good thing. (PAUSE) Yeah. My dojo was pretty small and not that many kids my own age which was good because I knew all the kids my own age in like a three mile radius and wasn\u2019t friends with any of them.

Like you don\u2019t do that. \u201cYou just don\u2019t do that guys.\u201d It was like for me like... So I stopped doing shotokan (ph) after about six months. My roommate... One of my roommates did it. And it was a nice enough group of people and... (SIGH) But I stopped doing it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">the environment was really not geared toward taking care of one another\u2019s safety. And I had a problem with that. You know, like people would get mad at each other and try to hurt each other. And like that\u2019s the opposite of point, kind of... Like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in this...\u201d And also the way they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">did kicks was like knee injuries waiting to happen. It was fucked up. Like it was not a good system. But partly not a good system at all.

The thing is he\u2019s like this lovely kind of feckless person that just like courts disaster and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">know how. So I\u2019m fond of him. And then like Candace fell desperately in love with him and he was, just didn\u2019t handle it well. That was really where the \u201cBen Watts ruins everything\u201d comes from.
