down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I think pound 7 0 3 2 pound will work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Sure. (Pause) Yeah, sorry (inaudible 00:45).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: You know, it was kind of funny. So James gets home tonight. He seems to have actually been able to do what he went up there to do, so that\u2019s really good. So he\u2019s sending off the samples that he made for analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And we\u2019re going to dinner with some people from Ohio this weekend. You know, kind of like sort of people that you would never be friends with, except that you\u2019re in one situation together and then you both end up in the same place. You know, they like us and we like them. I think there\u2019s a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">mutual incomprehension. (inaudible 02:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: [That\u2019s all right] (ph). (inaudible 02:21)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Like, the biggest thing I can think of to say is, like, well, they\u2019re sort of rednecks, except I feel like I I feel like, you know, (inaudible 02:43) more James than myself kind of girl but rednecks, and so we (inaudible 02:48). Pacific Northwest rednecks? Is that a thing? I don\u2019t know. Anyway, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">they\u2019re really fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Where are they from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I think the husband\u2019s from somewhere around here (inaudible 03:09) Midwest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 03:17) there\u2019s probably some different name for something like that (inaudible 03:22).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Fair enough, yeah. Yeah. (inaudible 03:28) usually, like, freaking (inaudible 03:37), like, massive amounts of meat (ph). It\u2019s really fun. (Laughter) I feel like sports and videogames are the two areas that, like, I just am not equipped to deal with socially. Like, I just got nothing. I like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">playing sports, but I just, you know, I enjoy watching sports games, but I don\u2019t care enough to I don\u2019t care enough to follow a team, ever, or to watch a game if it\u2019s not everyone else is doing or to go to a game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I feel like I\u2019m (inaudible 04:48) conditions. Just, like, this sounds really interesting for you guys, but I got nothing. (Pause) It\u2019s sort of strange for me, getting to the age where you have couple friends, like, friends as a couple. And be like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Henry and Mitchell\u2019s house.\u201d Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">this person and this person thing (ph). [It\u2019s also] (ph) a little strange when, like, I do things without James and people sort of look a little bit (inaudible 05:32) at me. Like, going to, like, church events without James. Maybe I just feel weird about it and other people don\u2019t feel weird. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">know. But [I just feel really weird] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">There\u2019s a new priest at my church. A woman, about my age. Maybe a little older. (Pause) [I don\u2019t know what I think about her] (ph). I don\u2019t know. She seemed completely terrified (laughter) last week, which is the first week I saw her. Actually, I do. My dad sent me an article that mentioned her, so, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">like, I know she\u2019s been ordained for, like, some time. (inaudible 06:43) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">We went out to the pond. Is that it? (inaudible 08:09) yesterday, [on the] (ph) dock. I had to drop something off there. It\u2019s very frustrating. Like, one thing that I find frustrating about these two older kids is that, like, what Jackson (sp?) doesn\u2019t like playgrounds. So (laughter) it\u2019s like all <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">of the things I do, he kind of just, like, drags his feet about (ph). Like, he\u2019ll once we get there, he\u2019ll sort of step up a little bit, but, like, (inaudible 08:39) just really likes going on the swing set and, like, really likes, you know, playing on the playground. But (inaudible 08:44) like, \u201cI <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">want to go home now. I\u2019m tired.\u201d (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559829\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">Sharon (sp?) also really likes the swings (inaudible 09:09). You know, she\u2019s like, not even she\u2019s not walking yet. But she gets really excited. So they swing for, like, ten minutes and (inaudible 09:23) like (sighs), \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to do something else now?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, (inaudible 09:27). Go away.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">(Laughter) \u201cGo do something.\u201d [I don\u2019t know] (ph). (inaudible 09:35) also started to, like like, we\u2019ll do something, an activity, and then as soon as it\u2019s over, (inaudible 09:41) like, \u201cWhat can I do now?\u201d And I\u2019m like (laughter) I think I need to step back a little bit from planning things (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">09:51). Well, I\u2019m sure you can figure out what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">[I don\u2019t know what] (ph) yeah, [I don\u2019t know what to say] (ph). Here I am, in it. I don\u2019t think there really is (inaudible 10:41) just be in it and keep going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What are you referring to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Just, like, (pause) not really wanting to be alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 11:29) you\u2019re describing feeling alienated or disconnected. Or kind of not wanting to be here. And (pause) I think that\u2019s probably what it\u2019s like. I think there\u2019s a lot of kind of (inaudible 12:14) alienation and not wanting, like just not wanting to be at the playground when\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: That\u2019s pretty good. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 12:28)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Like, you want to be dead. I guess what I mean is (pause) not just that you don\u2019t want to be here on this earth, but also here in this room, talking to me when you\u2019re feeling that way, which involves also a sense of alienation. And then, like, (pause) maybe also, like, (inaudible 13:08), <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">\u201cAre we done yet?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I would rather be here than most other places. (Pause) (inaudible 13:28) not to look too hard, but the distinction between I would rather do this and I would actually want to do this. I mean, you know. [Would you] (ph)? I don\u2019t know. So yeah, you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I think I missed the distinction -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Oh, that, like just because I would rather be here than most things doesn\u2019t mean that I want to be here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: If I look at that too hard and, like, you know, all of my options start to look pretty (ph) bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">There\u2019s always (pause) you know, I say like I do say, like, \u201cAm I done yet?\u201d for whatever I\u2019m doing (inaudible 15:16) but there\u2019s always something else to do after that. It\u2019s sort of like trying to sleep on, like, waiting on the bus or someplace uncomfortable where, like, each position isn\u2019t actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">comfortable, but it\u2019s more comfortable than what it was before, but not really (inaudible 15:45). I just had, like, mud all over my legs (inaudible 15:57) they apparently decided to redo all of the sidewalks in Andover, as far as I can tell. Which would be great, if they, like, had other sidewalks that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">we could walk in, but (laughter) they\u2019re just like, \u201cNo, you can walk on the road. It\u2019s fine.\u201d So (laughter) I keep having to, like, find alternate routes to get here and dodge traffic. You know, it\u2019s Andover. They\u2019re used to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559829\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 16:40) pedestrians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, yeah. Even in my sleep, I dream. (Pause) And I don\u2019t usually like, I don\u2019t remember dreams very well, but tend to remember, like, not what happened but, like, the emotions that I had in the dream. (Pause) [Things are] (ph) pretty anxious and frustrating for me [at night] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">So (inaudible 18:50) try not to, like, step back and look at things [in whole] (ph), in the way that I\u2019m doing now. But just try to be caught up in whatever I\u2019m doing. Yeah, so really, most of the day I\u2019m okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m sure the kids help with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 19:24) with you and (inaudible 19:27), like, just finding something for yourself to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: [Pay attention to] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, [it\u2019s like I\u2019m here] (ph). I think one of the things that\u2019s helpful here is the sense that, like, there\u2019s a problem (inaudible 19:59). Like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there seems to be something about when the focus is instead really (ph) on you. That it\u2019s much more involved (ph). That it\u2019s supposed to (inaudible 20:52) like, when there\u2019s a problem (inaudible 20:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: I guess I mean like it\u2019s like I come here and, you know, we do, like, talk about (inaudible 21:06) a lot of it is talking about not, like, what not, like, this moment, but more general things [about me] (ph). And that (inaudible 21:28) [tend to frame it] (ph) as a problem. [That\u2019s what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">do] (ph). I don\u2019t think I said that very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">In some ways, I feel like (inaudible 22:42). I guess I feel in some ways I can tell you these various things because, like, I want you to help me with them. A lot of it is wanting somebody else (inaudible 23:00) and a lot of it is just feeling like, well, if I weren\u2019t telling anybody, I would feel guilty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">about that. [You know] (ph), like, for being part of this social (ph) contract is, like, (inaudible 23:24). That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">It occurred to me, I\u2019m being really boring today. (Laughter) Like, oh god.

I never, like, I\u2019ve never been to a full-service gas station. And suddenly in Denver, like, I can\u2019t find anything else. That kind of creeps me out a little bit. Like, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m (inaudible 25:02). This is weird for me. I feel like I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">supposed to tip but, like, can\u2019t really afford to go to a gas station where I have to tip. Like, (inaudible 25:12).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: People hardly ever tip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Okay, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Used to, but not -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Used to, but not anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: James has this is so James. He\u2019s got, like, a book where he keeps track of, like, total mileage of the car. The miles that it went since the last time you pumped gas. The date. How expensive the gas was. How much he got. Like, he just keeps track of all of it. I usually remember to update <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">it. (Pause) That\u2019s one of the things that is (ph), like, both very useful and also kind of irritating. And also, I just find adorable. (Laughter) [Can you imagine that] (ph)? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559829\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">[I think it\u2019s been filled up like] (ph) five times this year so far, maybe, rather than, like, once a month. Like every six weeks. I feel good about that. (inaudible 27:32) I like driving more often now. (inaudible 27:42) driving to Boston, it should be me rather than James. Crazy drivers drive me nuts <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">less than they do James. Like, and I\u2019m also, like, a more aggressive driver than he is. Not aggressive, I don\u2019t think, but I\u2019m more willing to tolerate a world in which, like, nobody ever signals and people cut you off. Like going around those roundabouts on Aurora, but, like, (laughter) totally insane. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">Like, who designs this shit? (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Years ago, we called them circles of death. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. People just, like, drive into me because (inaudible 28:42) to get off and, you know, why are you going in this direction? But, you know, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t think it would be fine for James. It\u2019s distracting. (Pause) (inaudible 29:16) the first couple of years that I had a car, I loved <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">driving. I didn\u2019t have a car until I was in college. (inaudible 29:30) I liked being able to get in the car and start driving, and know that, like, I didn\u2019t have to come back if I didn\u2019t want to. Like, I could just keep going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">(inaudible 30:12)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">I finished James\u2019 shirt. Did I tell you that? I\u2019ve (ph) been making a collared shirt, like, a long time ago. And I sort of put it down and didn\u2019t pick it back up. I think I, like, did the cuffs wrong, and so I finished it. I sort of said, \u201cWhatever, the cuffs are just going to be wrong. [Who\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">to notice] (ph)?\u201d Which is usually what I do when something goes wrong. And so, I have to, like, put it away until I can reconcile myself [to it] (ph) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Not being okay. (Laughter) Rather than or reconcile myself to trying to fix it, which is annoying. I\u2019m glad. I feel like I did something (inaudible 33:30). (Pause) (inaudible 33:39) he doesn\u2019t like to wear t-shirts. He doesn\u2019t he just doesn\u2019t like them. I think he gets, like, claustrophobic <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">about, like, necks. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">Yeah, I made him a scarf and he won\u2019t, like, wear it like a normal scarf. (inaudible 34:31)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m wondering if you aren\u2019t actually just distracting yourself, but also do (pause) you generally feel good about some of the things that occupy you. With the kids or with James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. No, I do. You know, (pause) I, like it goes in and out. Like, I (pause) that\u2019s one thing that I don\u2019t really understand about it, is that, like, (inaudible 36:16) like where my life is right now. I really like a lot of the things in it and, you know, (inaudible 36:29).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Maybe somehow it\u2019s also very important to maintain that idea that, really, you want to just kill yourself all the time, unless you\u2019re distracted. (Pause) Even if it\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not saying I (inaudible 36:59) true, or even that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: (inaudible 37:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Untrue. But (pause) yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: That sounds like it\u2019s probably right. (inaudible 37:32)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Sure. Know why? (Laughter) I had a thought (ph). (Pause) Okay, so earlier, (pause) wherever you were talking about your friends or people talking about sports or videogames. You\u2019re like, \u201cYou can talk about sports. I got nothing,\u201d you know. (Pause) I think that\u2019s actually a little complicated, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">and maybe in a way that\u2019s parallel to feeling suicidal. Like, the (pause) okay, so, like, with the sports thing. You don\u2019t like sports. You\u2019re not into sports. People are talking about sports. You don\u2019t have much to say. You feel, like, kind of alienated. What are you going to do? I think this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A92\">how you can feel like that. Like, \u201cIt sucks. I\u2019m in so much pain. I don\u2019t want to be here. Other (ph) things feel awful or impossible. What am I going to do?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559829\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">But actually, I think in both cases, there\u2019s another component there that you may (inaudible 39:23), which is it kind of sucks to be with people who are talking about something that you don\u2019t really have any interest in, knowledge of or care a whole lot about, like sports. (Pause) Depending on the context <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">of how long it goes on, it\u2019s not very nice. [You\u2019re going out with a couple] (ph) and they just want to talk about sports, and clearly, this is not something you can relate to or contribute to. Like, it feels shitty. And yeah, I imagine you don\u2019t want to be there anymore, talking about sports. (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">40:09) maybe not talking about (laughter) sports, and not feeling part of the conversation and not feeling connected, and not feeling like anybody\u2019s paying attention to that, because this is obviously not something that you can relate to much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">And (pause) I guess, you know, in that it (ph) suggests that there\u2019s also perhaps a bit of an edge for you to, like, \u201cI got nothing\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of the conversation.\u201d Which I think you kind of disavowed it, you know, and I think you put it as a, like, \u201cWell, I just don\u2019t have anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">to say because it\u2019s not a (inaudible 40:54) interest for me.\u201d Which I think leads out to this other thing of how it feels that you\u2019re being treated. And, you know, maybe a bit more of a kind of edge in how you feel about what\u2019s going on. Which I imagine, and maybe wrongly, maybe there with the suicidality <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">(ph) as well. Like, (pause) sure (inaudible 41:25) that hurts a lot and a lot of situations feel and they are impossible and feel awful, and you don\u2019t see a way out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">But I wonder if there\u2019s also that part where it\u2019s an edge, where there\u2019s an edge, where (pause) people have disappointed you or promised you things that haven\u2019t panned out. Or said they were there for you or promised to be there for you in ways that they weren\u2019t. Or alienated you. Again, that\u2019s with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">the conversation about sports. And in subtle ways that either you know they were kind of acknowledging were not (pause) attentive (ph) or kind (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: [I am] (ph).
