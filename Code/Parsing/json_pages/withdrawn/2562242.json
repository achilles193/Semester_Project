(pause) Like, as the therapist I go (ph) from being someone who shows up to let you in to being a therapist or I\u2019m like, having a life outside in which they might get engaged. [Do you know what I mean?] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">(ph) (inaudible at 00:06:50) can you cross that a little bit and tell you something about it or is that too weird or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: James doesn\u2019t seem to get anxious about those things. I get really anxious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: You do, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I get really anxious. (pause) I was thinking about this in terms of like, the people who work at Calvary. so I went out for drinks with Camilla, who\u2019s a priest there. She\u2019s been there for like six months. She\u2019s probably like mid-thirties. And some of the paid singers. And it was definitely like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">everybody was sort of letting their hair down. (pause) And I guess that I hadn\u2019t seen any of the priests at Calvary sort of relax their pastoral presence around parishioners before. And I\u2019m not really sure how I feel about that. And that like I sort of find it a relief to have somebody clearly not worry <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200432\">about what I am thinking. And I\u2019m a priest\u2019s kid, you know? It\u2019s still weird for me to think of myself as a parishioner.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562242\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: You sort of feel on the inside?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I do and I\u2019m not and so it\u2019s sort of hard to negotiate that.

I think partly because the people haven\u2019t really, it\u2019s like a big sustained project, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">people haven\u2019t really wanted to put aside the time for it. And I think honesty because the rector (ph) and the sort of veteran (ph) priest, the people who are giving the lectures aren\u2019t really doing a lot of biblical scholarship. Basically, they\u2019ll read one good commentary and draw from there. Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">is fine, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re saying things that are wrong, they\u2019re just not really it\u2019s fairly fluffy. And to me, I feel like that (pause) the opportunity here is to introduce a whole lot of people to things that we actually know and aren\u2019t actually that controversial but nobody knows about. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B3\">if the problem you see in the Episcopal church is biblical illiteracy, you can\u2019t just read it. I don\u2019t know. And so I was sort of treading cautiously but alluding to some of that with her and she was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t very pastoral of me but within this conversation, I\u2019m going to say, yes, I don\u2019t like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B4\">the way they\u2019re doing this.\u201d And on one had I feel sort of good. On the other I\u2019m like, \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t have done that. Probably not a good choice.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Uh-uh<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) I think I was talking about it within the context of the so a group at Calvary asked me to give a lecture on the third and I\u2019ve just sort recently come up with what I want to talk about and didn\u2019t want to step on anybody else\u2019s toes and I didn\u2019t know where the toes were <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">but people are touchy about authority and get very protective of it and I don\u2019t always know where they are going to be protective so I\u2019m trying to just cover all my bases. (pause) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">But I mean, I find it very frustrating because I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not the only biblical scholar at the church. They have a very well educated congregation. They could do a lot better. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Uh-uh (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: [It\u2019s funny.] (ph) (inaudible at 00:15:30) it is making me wonder about whether there are things that you (pause) would want to have thought of, want to say or ask about me that you\u2019re worried about bringing up or feeling like stepping on my toes or it would be inappropriate or (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: (laughs) Sorry, I\u2019m laughing because I was thinking \u201cSo much for the mislead there.\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: (laughs) (pause) Do you mean like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Kind of like, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about (inaudible at 00:16:21) and just like, \u201cYeah, okay, no.\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m back and forth.

Those two going together is something that I have a hard time processing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mhm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: And also to me it seems that like, much of my being curious about you is sort of, is again, sort of a mislead for me.
