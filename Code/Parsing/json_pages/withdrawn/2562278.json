(chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">But it\u2019s more like I just got really scared and I\u2019m really scared. And I \u2013 (pause) (sigh) I don\u2019t know, I \u2013 (pause) this is a very kind of interesting thing where I sort of feel like my whole was tense. I feel like, \u201cOkay shoulders, relax.\u201d (chuckle) \u201cRelax.\u201d Then I\u2019d be like, \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not okay.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">And like tense up again.

And I don\u2019t feel good that I wasn\u2019t the one who got to tell them that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">or got to decide whether they know that. I don\u2019t feel good that (pause) I \u2013 (sigh) (pause) that like the conversations that I have had with James in the last week or so, that felt most sort of intimate, and understanding, and relaxed, and (pause) supportive, you know, then ended up passing on to other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">people. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562278\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">That\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel good that I\u2019m not allowed to be angry about that.

And a part of that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">is like, she really doesn\u2019t understand the all of this. It\u2019s not that she \u2013 she\u2019s really sympathetic, but she doesn\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t resonate with her; it doesn\u2019t make sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">And so it\u2019s \u2013 in the back of my mind I\u2019m always like I\u2019m the person who\u2019s putting her baby through this horrible ordeal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: And \u2013 (pause)  (pause) You know, and my mom, I know will sort of use this to further like blur the lines between me and her. And say, \u201cOh, I did this thing too.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know whether like the last time I was in Frederick I just \u2013 it feels like sharing like the externals of the situation, or versus the internal. Like when I was Frederick last time, I think I was not sharing the internal parts with James either. So he doesn\u2019t necessarily see a difference. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">You know, I was doing UCT, so like nobody had access (chuckle) to my (interior) (ph) like that, including me.  (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: There wasn\u2019t a whole lot apparently.

(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: At least that we can know about it. (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) Like (pause) I started to feel like James was upset with me because I wasn\u2019t successful in my effort not to react in any way until I could assess what the best way of approaching the situation was. I literally had an involuntary exclamation when I read the e-mail. (overlapping <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">voices) And that, and he was like, \u201cWhat is it? What is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d And I couldn\u2019t not answer then. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Because he knew I was reading that e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: And I feel like that\u2019s what he\u2019s upset about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Or (pause) (sigh) you know I didn\u2019t say I was angry with him; I didn\u2019t say I was angry with what he\u2019d done.

Actually, I didn\u2019t say I was upset about what had happened, I said that like I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to share that much, which is not the same thing at all. (pause) I feel like my problem is really bottling up emotions; this isn\u2019t going to help very much.  (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I felt the same.

(pause)  That the point of keeping people out, or away from what\u2019s going on, especially like bad things you feel, I think has been because you anticipated that like that would give them a kind of \u2013 that would give other people a kind of access <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">to you that would be very dangerous. (pause) That would sort of \u2013 that they would react to in their own way, or from their own frame of reference without taking yours into account, in a way that would be very hurtful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I mean I don\u2019t think this is like what you\u2019re describing with James\u2019 mom, your mom and James are all sort of different types of examples of that I think (pause)  (pause) that it might seem clear like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(pause)  (pause) (sigh) Could you (pause) see why James is upset? I mean I sort of see it clearly enough that I can\u2019t push past it to get to how I\u2019m upset. (pause) But I don\u2019t know what to do about that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well it kind of struck me is that there\u2019s really no room for both of you to be upset, somehow.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">For which I mean, like (pause) it seems to me as though it feels like (pause) you can\u2019t both be angry, and upset about it, and scared, and partly angry at him. (pause) Also recognizing that, you know, (pause) there\u2019s some sort of (pause) as yet to be determined (inaudible at 00:16:51), it\u2019s not entirely <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">his fault, in that the situation has sort of changed (inaudible at 00:16:55), you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And where at least in your sense of it, he can\u2019t be upset that, you know, you\u2019re mad at him, and (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah I imagine that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: he was trying to do something he thought was helpful at least consciously, (pause) and that you\u2019re angry, and disappointed anyway, (pause) and, you know, where he can feel that way, but also kind of see where you\u2019re coming from. It sounds like it\u2019s way too kind of jammed together.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: So today is Ash Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Which I don\u2019t know how much you know about this, but I\u2019m going to go to church this evening, and they\u2019re going to take some ashes, and put them our forehead across, and say, \u201cRemember that you are dust, and unto dust you shall return.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">It\u2019s like one of my favorite services in the year, actually. But, (pause) Lent is hard, because it\u2019s sort of traditionally about like repentance, and atonement, and thinking a lot about (sin) (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s virtually impossible for me to do that in a healthy way. Like I just \u2013 I get swallowed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like you\u2019re just talking about in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause)  So you know, (pause) a lot of times, people give up chocolate, or something like not eating it on Fridays. So I decided I was going to stop self-injuring myself, or stop injuring during Lent, and that\u2019s going to be my discipline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019m going to make. (laughter) It feels pretty ambitious today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: And Lent goes \u2018til Easter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Which is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: 40 days. (pause) It\u2019s not really one I can talk about with people. People are like, \u201cWhat are you giving up for Lent?\u201d Like that\u2019s something people actually ask, which I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019m only now realizing like how glaringly inappropriate that question is.  (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">Like if they\u2019re asking intrusive questions, then that would be a lie. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Then you make your point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: (laughter) (pause) Camilla, one of the priests at my church visited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: I like her a lot. (sigh) (pause) I think she didn\u2019t quite get like (pause) she sort of like gets really excited, like talks about theology, and gets really excited about it. And I do the same thing; it\u2019s like that\u2019s very fun. But so like she visited the first time, and she visited twice briefly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">And the first time we were talking, and (sigh) I don\u2019t remember what I was saying, but we were sort of like talking about like the intersection of mental illness and theology. And she was sort of talking about my experience, and got really into it. Then she was like, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, like this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">your life.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI know, but it\u2019s interesting, right?\u201d She was like, \u201cYes!\u201d (laughter) So that was good. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">But (pause) then like the second time she visited, we were sort of doing the same thing, and (pause) I don\u2019t remember exactly what she said, but like (pause) something like (inaudible at 00:24:20) touched in her, or like very much sort of hit me. And I\u2019m like, (sigh) hit that sort of (pause) horror <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">of it, and I think that came out either in like what I said or how I looked.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562278\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">I think it sort of scared her. She reacted really well, like she sort of just sat with it. Then like, you know (pause) I told a (halfway) (ph) made a joke, and that was fine. (pause) I guess like I can\u2019t (pause) it\u2019s hard \u2013 it feels sort of hard for me to understand that like people can\u2019t see that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">in me. Like that she wouldn\u2019t have ever been around me in a context where like (pause) like she would know that that\u2019s what it\u2019s like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">I don\u2019t \u2013 am I making any sense? I can\u2019t tell whether like the sort of shorthand that I\u2019m using is actually expresses what I needed to express. I guess I mean like, I talked with her about like being in the hospital before, and like being mentally ill, and having really severe depression, and trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">to describe that. (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">Sometimes I\u2019ll talk about it, and like feeling like I\u2019m in this pit. Or (pause) (sigh) but I don\u2019t \u2013 (pause) and so it doesn\u2019t occur to me that like people don\u2019t necessarily understand what that means, because when I talk about it, I\u2019m just sort of talking about it like this. (pause) I don\u2019t know; <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">You know, I started crying when Mark was there, and at the end of the visit, he was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve never seen you cry before.\u201d (pause) And you know, he has visited me in the hospital before, like I don\u2019t \u2013 that hadn\u2019t occurred to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean it seems like you\u2019re sort of sandwiching between talking about it and conveying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yes.  (pause) (sigh) You know in some ways like, I talking about it, because I feel like (pause) (sigh) I feel like that helps me sort of get my head around it or have some power over it. (pause) But it also seems to maybe leave out everything essential. (chuckle) Or (inaudible at 00:27:33). <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">(pause)  (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Well I think you have two worries about conveying it. One is sort of the word that\u2019s just come up. I mean in a way, it seems to me like that\u2019s actually what James did more than you wanted. You know the level of detail which he was describing; it felt more like he was conveying it in some way.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so; I think really more of what something is there like he was conveying a lot of like sort of theories about it, and I feel like (pause) I mean, one of the problems that I run into with James, is that like I\u2019ll tell him about something that like I\u2019ve talked about with you, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">that I\u2019ve talked about with somebody else; he\u2019s like, \u201cMaybe this is what\u2019s going on.\u201d And he\u2019ll just get stuck on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">And then I won\u2019t be able to say like, \u201cNo, but there\u2019s like that\u2019s sort of a simple certain way of thinking about it.\u201d Or like, \u201cThings are more complicated.\u201d Or, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I\u2019m thinking about it now.\u201d And I just feel like that would sort of be a little more (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Clearly, I (inaudible at 00:30:17) only because it (pause) it lines up for me in sort of the way that it\u2019s unending kind of parallel to like, you know, the humanities versus the heart scientists. Like, \u201cYou know, today it\u2019s one thing, and tomorrow it might be something else. I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">revise and update.\u201d Whereas like, \u201cThis is how it works.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562278\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I know that\u2019s not \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s close anyway. (chuckle) (pause) I don\u2019t know, but I think \u2013 I think actually what I\u2019m sort of objecting to, I\u2019m not getting mad at I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Sounds to me like what you\u2019re describing is the sort of provisional aspect of what you are saying gets lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And so it\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re held to whatever you said? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Or whatever the idea was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: In some way that (pause) I guess leads to (pause) like it\u2019s both misunderstanding and a kind of shaming. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I think that like I\u2019m sort of trying to revise, because I think that that\u2019s like what I\u2019m upset about, but it\u2019s clearly not why I\u2019m upset, if that makes sense. Like I \u2013 (pause) I think you\u2019re right that it\u2019s some sort of (sigh) (pause) some like (pause) I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">part of me that I (pause) would not necessarily have chosen to give to people.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">I\u2019m sorry, I think I interrupted you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s all right. If my \u2013 what I was going to say that, I think for you there are two dangers in that; one which is what happened, which is that (pause) people that will use that according to their own agendas in ways that are very hurtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">And the other is that (pause) that becomes your agenda which really hurts somebody else. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. So if this awful, why would I want to share that with anybody? But I think (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I mean it doesn\u2019t seem like (pause) you seem to sort of feel a bit more anxious, and upset, and a little pressure even when you came in, knowing that you (pause) were going to tell me about what just happened. And, I think in a way relieved that (pause) or less fear than you often are, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">that what you were saying was going to either, you know, hurt me or that I was going to respond in a way that was kind of using it in some way to hurt you. (pause) I mean you\u2019re still probably pretty worried about those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Oh good. (pause) [You think you\u2019ll ask your mom about that] (ph)? (pause) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t \u2013 (pause) I don\u2019t think that (pause) that I\u2019m worried going forward, because (pause) I cannot tell James things. Like (pause) I can\u2019t like (pause) (figure) (ph) him out, and so I just don\u2019t (pause)  (pause) you know, but I \u2013 that vulnerability is just there. I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">yeah, it was always there, but now I have to like pay attention to it. (chuckle) (pause) I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. (pause) Probably just try not to think about it or anything. (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">I shouldn\u2019t read through all the e-mails. I think I read the first couple, and then like I just don\u2019t really know that [it\u2019s necessary] (ph), or at least right now; I can\u2019t deal with it anything else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: I think James was really angry; not like about this, but about my being in the hospital. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Which means I think that (inaudible at 00:40:45) that either he maybe was right. I mean because (pause) I too also wonder if you (pause) I don\u2019t entirely \u2013 well, I wonder about the extent to which you feel like you\u2019ve done something terribly wrong, or you deserve sort of maybe like really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">angry or punishing, because you will allow yourself to really be taken care of.

(pause) I guess when you say that, I think of what more of my concern is like (pause) when he conveys that he\u2019s angry, and it seems like part of the problem is you feel (pause) a part of you that \u2013 of course even though you should be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah.
