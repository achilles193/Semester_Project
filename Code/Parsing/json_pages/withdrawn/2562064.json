I took one of Kim\u2019s (sp) car keys home with me yesterday, and like the keys to Frank\u2019s car, because I had to move <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">it to get the other car out, so then I had to bring it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: James and I are going to go have some pizza and play some Settlers of Katan (sp) with a couple friends from my church. A little bit anxious. I feel like it\u2019s a huge sacrifice to ask James for something and I feel like it\u2019s infringing on him, much more than it actually is. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t feel very good about it at all today.

I\u2019m having a very hard time talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I had this thought of a game with James, where you know, you\u2019re going to have it your people to do this in your way and this is an infringement for me, like what they go to put in the game with James. (therapist speaks very low, hard to hear) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

I said do you want to talk about it and he said no, I don\u2019t, I said okay. Do you need to not go tonight and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">he said no and then sort of gave me a look as to say God, what\u2019s wrong with you! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(very long pause, client is crying quietly)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I wonder if your feelings of all of the mish-mash of things vary in terms like from that.

I\u2019ve been telling him that I\u2019ve needed to do all these things to do today and I said I have a really full day for your day off and clearly in his head it was like and that could easily wear you out or send you spiraling into depression and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">I would have to deal with it so you need to take better care of yourself and I didn\u2019t really like choose to have a whole bunch of things that I had to do today, it just happened and so I am doing it! Oh well, and the things that I did choose, are the things that I really wanted to do. Now I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">I can\u2019t be tired at the end of the day because I know that it will be an \u201cI told you so\u201d and you should take better care of yourself and I like need church I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562064\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: It feels like he supports me doing it and is telling me to build a support system other than him and you know make relationships and take care of myself in that way but that it also feels like he really resents the time that I it means I don\u2019t spend a lot of time with him on Sundays or it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">takes a big chunk of my free time away from him and he\u2019s just not interested in being involved at all and to some extent I\u2019m like sorry, it\u2019s a part of being married, like you have to go to dinners together you know? I just don\u2019t know what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(long pause, client crying softly)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Not only are these situations impossible in the way that you describe, but that the stakes feel incredibly high, regardless of the moment of what they are, they certainly feel that way. I think that any of these things could really push the two of you over the edge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t trust myself to know how high the stakes are, or to be able to tell what is going to be important and what\u2019s not important. I will attach huge importance to, this going to be terrible, but like doing dishes, or I don\u2019t like to do dishes basically and I don\u2019t do them a lot. I just fret <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">over that and it seems really important and then James will be like no, no, that\u2019s really not a big deal but then other things that it never occurred to me would be important would turn out to be really hurtful for him and I feel like I don\u2019t trust him to half the things he says not be a big deal, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">actually not be a big deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(very long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: It feels like I am so careful around him, like just so careful and what I am being told is sort of simultaneously it\u2019s wrong for you to be so careful or unhealthy or not necessary or something and at the same time but your just really not careful enough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(very long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Making you go to pieces somewhat, confronted with a (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes as you see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I know your upset, but that\u2019s not exactly what I mean. I mean maybe in a way you feel like you\u2019re in pieces, one piece that\u2019s trying to relax and not be so careful and the other piece that is trying to be very wary and sort of attentive and accommodating. Another piece that\u2019s feeling helpless <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">and overwhelmed, another piece that\u2019s feeling frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes, I think so.
