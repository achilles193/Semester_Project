It\u2019s written by an undergrad who had been hospitalized for suicidality and then like forced to withdraw.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">And basically it was like, \u201cHey, it\u2019s really shitty when we make students withdraw after being suicidal.\u201d And in her case, it seemed like a situation where she was feeling suicidal and she like self-injured. But it wasn\u2019t a suicide attempt and it wasn\u2019t even really close, and like it was kind of\u2026was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">a shitty situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">And\u2026I don\u2019t know. I sort of started reading it and like her experience with hospitalization was like really bad and she had very bad things to say about it and it also seems like\u2026yeah. It seemed like it kind of sucked and she wasn\u2019t really treated very well. Basically I just felt really bad after reading <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">it. Like it made me very like anxious and afraid and upset, and ahmm\u2026yeah. [inaudible 0:01:52] like have anything to say about that, but now I really can\u2019t get that out of my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: So that was today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was just like a couple of hours ago. Yeah. I guess one of the things that sort of struck me was that like this triggering situation that she was describing was like it\u2019s still sort of a weekly thing for me. (Laughs) I\u2019m like, \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d (Laughs) I don\u2019t know what to say about that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">(Laughs) Other than like I\u2019m glad that my treatment\u2019s better than hers. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I imagine it makes you feel in danger. I don\u2019t mean like from yourself. I mean\u2026I don\u2019t even mean sort of like realistically somebody\u2019s going to come in and do something. I don\u2019t think you think that, but ahmm\u2026I [inaudible 0:03:03] like you have such a strong sort of inclination toward <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">thinking like it\u2019s going to be really bad if this gets out. You know? Or if you\u2019re really having trouble and especially if people really know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s exactly what\u2026I mean in a way what she\u2019s saying happened to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Ahmm\u2026yeah. I mean it seems like from the way that she described it, it seems like she was committed like involuntarily. And that she was not expecting to be committed. Like that was not a consequence that she was expecting of seeking help, which is why what she did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Like she talked to her counselor and they took her to urgent care, and then things sort of spiraled from there. Yeah and like\u2026yeah. I guess it makes me feel very vulnerable. Yeah and there are things about being hospitalized that like even if I can see their reasoning, it\u2019s still pretty traumatic. Yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">Like being strip searched. That sucks. Like it\u2019s awful. Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:05:17] pretty well for the sense of exposure and vulnerability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [Pause] Yeah. Like I\u2019m\u2026I guess I\u2026yeah. I could have not read the article, but once I started reading it, I could not finish it. Or like it wasn\u2019t you read one paragraph and then that was [inaudible 0:06:19]. It wasn\u2019t. And like\u2026I don\u2019t know. I guess I feel like it just sort of snuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">up on me. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Something that like I can tell people about [inaudible 0:06:57] or I cannot tell people about it, but like neither one of those really is perfect, because if I don\u2019t tell people about it, then it\u2019s still there. And if I tell people about it, like I can\u2019t control their reactions. Like I can\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562082\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">At the same time, I feel like if I had read that article before I was ever hospitalized, it would have made me very, very resistant to being hospitalized and it\u2019s like that would be a bad thing. Like \u201cBeing in the hospital sucks.\u201d But like being dead is probably worse. I don\u2019t know. But at the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">time, like if we don\u2019t talk about the failures in mental healthcare, then we can\u2019t fix them and so\u2026 [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Are you worried that you belong in a hospital or should be in a hospital or somebody [inaudible 0:09:15] thinks so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m worried that people will think so. I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. I feel like it\u2019s sort of\u2026I don\u2019t feel like I could say no. Like it doesn\u2019t seem right, but I don\u2019t\u2026that question doesn\u2019t help me sort of track down what I\u2019m worried about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: But it feels like there\u2019s something to track down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I kind of got that sense too. [inaudible 0:10:19] quite feel like what we got what shook you up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Or at least some important part of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I think one thing that I found sort of worrying or disturbing, is that like after reading the article, like I was left with a very strong desire to cut myself. I didn\u2019t, but I really wanted to and I thought about it. I don\u2019t know. Things still just feel so precarious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t know how to make them realize the precarious or more stable. Like I don\u2019t\u2026this is pretty stable for me. (Laughs) I don\u2019t know. Maybe a part of it is that like in some way like I feel so lucky in so many ways. Like I feel lucky in like being able to see you. I feel lucky in having <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">insurance that covers this. I\u2019m lucky in living in Cambridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Like, you know, I sort of like\u2026yeah. If I\u2019m going to be suicidal, this is the place and time to do it. (Laughs). Right. (Laughs) Ahmm. And [Pause] yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that I\u2019m getting worse necessary. It\u2019s that it feels very precarious. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">James told me a story that was like a news article that he was reading earlier today. I don\u2019t remember why he told me it. It\u2019s a terrible read, I think. Didn\u2019t really have much\u2026I don\u2019t know what it was. But it was like a young man in the 60s was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic after I think he killed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">his whole family. And spent six years in a mental institution and was eventually released.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">While he was in there, he started taking college classes. He was really\u2026he got a degree. Got a masters in psychology. Moved to Central Illinois and started teaching at like a liberal arts college and is still there teaching. Like has his Ph.D. He changed his name and recently somebody like tracked him <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">down and published like \u201cThis is where this guy is.\u201d And the university has been like, \u201cYeah. No. We\u2019re not firing this guy. He\u2019s a valued part of our faculty.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">And like there wasn\u2019t actually any point to the story. Like I don\u2019t think there was a punch line to it for James to tell me this. I don\u2019t know why he told me, but like, \u201cThat sort of shook me up\u201d or like\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really having a hard time pulling this together. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It seems to be something like he sort of seemed to be [inaudible 0:15:30] with something in you that\u2019s really\u2026I think that feels very disturbed or very much not well and not even close. And that I think is probably not something you talk about very much or talk easily about or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">But it got like jangled a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562082\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: By these stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not very particular, but I feel like it\u2019s something in that direction. [Pause] I [inaudible 0:16:40] something like the part of you that feels like [inaudible 0:16:42] feels like him, he\u2019s getting the message that, you know, either you\u2019re going to be kicked out for it, locked up against <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">your will and then kicked out for it, or kind of tracked down and exposed, even if you\u2019ve totally rebuilt your life, and had been living it in a perfectly reasonable way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don\u2019t know. And it sort of feels like by just talking about it a lot and trying to be open about it, like I\u2019m trying to forestall that in some ways. But I don\u2019t think it actually works like that. I\u2026yeah. And also\u2026I don\u2019t know. I feel sort of disingenuous or dishonest to you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">be talking so much about having not been well, while trying really, really hard to hide the fact that I\u2019m not well. Does that make sense? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">[Pause] Yeah. And sort of not at my best with the kids in the last couple of weeks. Like I can\u2019t say to Kim like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t done a great job. Like I\u2019ve just been really depressed.\u201d (Laughs) I\u2026yeah. I can\u2019t say that. I\u2019m really angry at myself that it feels like I haven\u2019t really like wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">to be at work or haven\u2019t really been at my best. Like I\u2019m angry that I\u2019ve sort of let myself be affected by all the stuff that\u2019s going on. Yeah. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Because when you think like maybe you\u2019re not often kinder, any kinder or more tolerant of like the way which you feel so depressed, then like just folks in the articles were kinder to than those people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:21:05]. [Pause] I wonder if like both of those things feed into like you\u2019re having cut afterward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Well I didn\u2019t actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry. [inaudible 0:21:36] impulse to. Right. [inaudible 0:21:39].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: (Laughs) I feel like whatever gold star I get for it, I want to make sure that you know. (Laughs) Ahmm, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Like the gold star\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: I honestly think it was just sort of like I wasn\u2019t having a great day and it\u2026like the idea was put into my mind by something else. And so I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s like a good idea.\u201d Like that is so easy for me now. Like that connection is so easy and that sort of spooks me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: So it was more like the cutting just being mentioned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: And having a bad day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. Not like a bad day for any reason. Just I\u2019m having bad days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: But the gold star, is that me that gives you the gold star? It sounded maybe that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Ahmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I think that was [inaudible 0:22:52].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think anybody gives me the gold star. I think I just wanted to make sure that you know that I get one. (Laughs) [Pause] Ahmm, [Pause]. I don\u2019t know whether I worry that I should be in the hospital. One thing that sort of spooks me is that like when I think about suicide, it\u2019s sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">split in my mind at this point between like asking for help to almost feel like suicidal on one hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562082\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">And on the other hand, like if I decide that I do want to commit suicide, like I\u2019m not going to ask for help. Like\u2026and so\u2026and that\u2019s scary. [Pause] It\u2019s just\u2026it doesn\u2019t feel close, but it doesn\u2019t feel that far away. But I don\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: I guess the scary part is like imagining yourself deciding to do it and just doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause] Yeah. [Pause] One of the things that I\u2019ve been saying to James increasingly about laying hand wavingly, [inaudible 0:27:29] is that like he has to trust me to run my own life. Like he has to trust me with it and our relationship is not going to work if he doesn\u2019t. But I also sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">of feel like well maybe he\u2019s right not to trust me, but like I don\u2019t\u2026yeah. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. I say that and like it\u2019s something about that rings sort of false for me, but I don\u2019t know what it is. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. What occurs to me is that there is this part of you that really does want to kill yourself a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Um hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: And that you worry about that part taking over or wearing\u2026I think maybe wearing the other parts of you down, or getting the upper hand in some particular moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Um hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: And acting and I imagine it comes from that worry, the thought that \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t trust me to run my own life.\u201d But even if you\u2019re worried about being able, you may have other things in mind about whether you might decide suicidality. But even if you\u2019re worried about not being able <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">to manage it, I don\u2019t think the alternative that you want for somebody else to just do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: And I wonder if that\u2019s maybe what rings false. Like that what you might want would be something a little more collaborative. I don\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: [inaudible 0:31:11]. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. [inaudible 0:32:09].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m not sure. [Pause] It feels like, it\u2019s sort of like I\u2019m unsettled about something or unhappy about something and I\u2019m sort of like going down one conversational path that we sort of had already and like well maybe this is it. But I don\u2019t know that\u2019s actually it. Then it doesn\u2019t help <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">me. (Laughs) [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I [inaudible 0:33:02] the first part of what I was saying before, about like there being a part of you that sort of often and intensely wants to kill yourself. Like that sort of ain\u2019t quite right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. No. That\u2019s definitely true. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: And maybe it\u2019s also that there\u2019s something about like letting you know that I know that. [inaudible 0:33:41] that deemed relevant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: That makes me feel better. Ahmm\u2026yeah. It\u2019s very helpful to me that you don\u2019t, for example, make me go to urgent care every time I come here. Ahmm\u2026yeah. [Pause] But maybe I still sort of want to question your judgment on that. (Laughs) [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:34:31]. [Pause] How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Just because I don\u2019t\u2026it sort of feels like you\u2019re saying like, \u201cNo. You can do this.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Yeah. Today I sort of think that I won\u2019t be able to. [Pause] It\u2019s not that I\u2019m there yet, but I can sort of see it coming or see it\u2026picture coming. But I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">think that there\u2019s anything to be done about it. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess it feels to you like I maybe don\u2019t get the precariousness and also sort of feeling like overestimate your like strength.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562082\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Certainly the latter. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Because if I didn\u2019t, I would probably do something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t know that you would. Like I don\u2019t think so. [inaudible 0:37:24].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Sometimes what\u2019s clearer is my sort of in a way like a confidence in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s sort of imagining you saying like, \u201cWell you might be able to live into this confidence and you might not. But confidence is sort of the best bet.\u201d Does that make sense? I don\u2019t\u2026like [Pause]. I guess it sort of\u2026it seems clear to me, but like it\u2019s not\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be helpful for you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">to panic when I tell you that I\u2019m feeling suicidal or be, you know, have\u2026take more actively intervening steps, like [inaudible 0:38:33] and sort of being in the hospital, like sort of know what you\u2019re going to do and that\u2019s pretty limited, like sort of done it. As if doing it again wouldn\u2019t be helpful. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">But I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Maybe part of what [inaudible 0:38:50] is that you panic a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: And so if I\u2019m not, it\u2019s almost like in a way I don\u2019t think you get it the way that you do, how dangerous things are. Although I do understand that you also know and know that I know what actually happens in a hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. Maybe you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Well I don\u2019t know. I mean what you seem clear about was that you do panic a bit yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: I do. Ahmm. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:39:55] a little. [inaudible 0:39:59] about that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying really hard not to worry about precise language here. So\u2026 (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Ahmm. [Pause] I mean the way that I sort of think about it I feel like I don\u2019t\u2026it feels like I don\u2019t have any choice about whether to panic or not. Like I don\u2019t intend to panic. I just do. Ahmm, it\u2019s sort of your job not to panic. (Laughs) Ahmm and so like\u2026I don\u2019t know. I guess I worry <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">that like you act like you think I\u2019ll be okay because that\u2019s the most likely to have a good outcome, but I don\u2019t know how likely that likely is. Yeah. I think that\u2019s about right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It could be terribly risky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Well, [inaudible 0:43:20] explain that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: (Laughs) You sound so surprised. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [inaudible 0:43:28] but like I have two things in mind, which are somewhat at odds. One is, you know, your safety and the other is your having a chance to talk about this with me. If it\u2019s plausible to me, that\u2019s crucial to addressing this, whatever the outcome of that\u2026you know, whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">the therapeutic outcome that will be. If it\u2019s so incendiary or like it means I have to react and send you some place, that\u2019s a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Um hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: And in most settings like sort of by their nature, that\u2019s not really part of the agenda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: How do you mean? What do you mean by \u201cmost settings?\u201d I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Like an urgent care setting or a short-term treatment setting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Okay. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: The point isn\u2019t like to address [inaudible 0:45:00].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) No. No. (Laughs) No. Yeah. I understand what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And\u2026so yeah. It seems to me quite important to like be enough room to talk about it, you know. While at the same time obviously your safety is important too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562082\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: We should stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
