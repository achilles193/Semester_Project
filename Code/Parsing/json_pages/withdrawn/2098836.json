I think that this thing that is really hard is going on with you. (pause) I don\u2019t know what it is, any more than usual. But, like, I just kind of feel like I\u2019ve been through a wringer this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Which isn\u2019t a bad thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: No, I think you\u2019re right. I think of a few instances where I\u2019ve, I think like that, which I imagine are some of the ones you\u2019re referring to, and (pause) I\u2019ll give it some thought. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Okay. I mean, maybe it\u2019s also that, like, it\u2019s been a really hard week, but I haven\u2019t been having a hard time when I\u2019ve been here, and so it\u2019s been both like, really hard in general, and I\u2019m kind of together enough in sessions to actually push harder, if that makes sense. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s possible I\u2019ve just sort of been clear about some things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019ll try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause) So I had a good day today, which is why I can, you know, bring that up. Yeah, I like, really didn\u2019t want to go to work today, and it turned out to be really good, and everybody was nice to me, and I worked really hard, and got shit done, and nothing tragic happened, and yeah. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">was nice. Got a week off, which I wasn\u2019t expecting to get. I wasn\u2019t expecting to get Christmas off, so I like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I see. Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: So (pause) bringing it up with me was difficult to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t actually, but I could see it being difficult. (pause) Yeah, it feels like the sort of thing that, it would be more than I would want to talk about, if I was like, it was last week. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: And I wouldn\u2019t want to talk about anything. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Glad it was a good day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, me too. You said yesterday that you thought it was very hard for me to be here. Because you know, I\u2019m sad and I don\u2019t want to talk about it and I don\u2019t want to make you experience it. And that\u2019s true, but there\u2019s also a sense in like, if I\u2019m here, like, I want to be as sad as I can. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D1\">(pause) Yeah. So. Yeah. Yesterday was very hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: No, just in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Okay.

(pause) Yeah, I went to work yesterday, I only worked from like 7:30 to 11:45, which is the worst shift, the worst, because you don\u2019t get a lunch, so you don\u2019t get to like, sit down for more than, you get one ten-minute break. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: And then you\u2019re closing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, in the evening. And you\u2019re closing, so you\u2019re like, sweeping, mopping, doing all the dishes, doing all the shit work. And you don\u2019t get to sit down. And it\u2019s, like, evening, so more of kind of like, strange people come in, and I\u2019m, like, less emotionally able to deal with them. So maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">it\u2019s not that more strange people come in, maybe it\u2019s just like, I can\u2019t deal with people. So I was, like, walking to work, and I was seriously, like, \u201cOkay, so if things get really bad, I can just like, go make myself throw up in the bathroom and then say that I\u2019m sick and go home.\u201d (chuckling) I actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">like told the shift supervisor, the guy that was closing with me, that I had had this thought, and he was like, \u201cMaybe you should look for a different job.\u201d (chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I was like, \u201cYeah. Yeah.\u201d (chuckling) So then, like, today was great, so... Today was like, this is why I work at coffee shops. Because I like people, I like getting to know people. I\u2019m starting to feel like I know the people who come in, more or less, and like, that\u2019s really nice. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">And you know, I was moving fast. I was everyone else there I move faster than, so, you know, I wasn\u2019t I end up going flat out and being really conscious that I am kicking some ass, or I didn\u2019t have to go flat out. So that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I like sitting down. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Did you have an eight-hour shift today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: So yesterday, this was like before I went to work and right before dinner, (pause) James needed to have a conversation about sex. And I was like, \u201cHard, hard conversation.\u201d And he really needed to talk about it. And I (pause) obviously, if he needed to talk about it, I need to talk about it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">(pause) So, you know, half of my mind was right there, and half of my mind was like, \u201cDo you really have to talk about this now?\u201d (chuckling) Really? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: What was up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Um...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Did you (inaudible)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Uh, not really. Um, mostly, just, like he wants to have a lot more sex than I do. And (pause) it wasn\u2019t (pause) like he was, he wasn\u2019t asking for anything so much as saying, how do we take care of both of us since this is the case? (pause) It was fine, (pause) just (pause) you know, it\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">hard for me not to feel guilty. And by hard, I mean I do not find it possible. (chuckling) (pause) Yeah. But I also just, like, you know, even when I\u2019m doing well, I don\u2019t want to have sex every day. And when I\u2019m not doing well... uh. It\u2019s just really hard. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">You know, in a sense, like, I would much rather be having sex every day than not. It\u2019s just like, I just can\u2019t do it. Like I want to want to have sex every day, it\u2019s like, we have good sex, like, it\u2019s really fun, I like it. I just, I don\u2019t have anything emotionally all of the time. Like, it\u2019s hard. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">(pause) Like, you know, sometimes it\u2019s hard even for him to, like, touch me. Like, I, just like, can\u2019t stand it because I\u2019m trying really hard to (pause) stay together, or something. Not like stay together (pause) not cry because that\u2019s not what the effort is. Or I don\u2019t know.

It was just odd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I expect you were a little more struck by (pause) saying it over here and hearing it over there than -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, than by people knowing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, um, (pause) thus I have to remember that that confirms that not telling people about the depression is probably the right choice at work. (chuckling). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Right.

Definitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Definitely. However, it was very hard. And (pause) you know, and in that sense (pause) you know it\u2019s in part something you don\u2019t want. You know, even if it\u2019s something you do.

(pause) It\u2019s like, trying to like, lift something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201111\">heavy really far out, like hold it very far out.

It was like, other people did not see <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201191\">it as well as my parents. (pause) But you know, then I (inaudible).

You know, high school life. I had friends that I could talk about it with. Of course, they were friends who were also themselves depressed, so that was a little bit of a downer as well, but I think it was actually pretty good for all of us. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: So (pause) you know.

Just so you know, Jenna (inaudible) was really depressed as well. But I never really knew that until like, we were adults. And we never talked about it. I just felt like I was the only person. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">She was, like, (pause) I don\u2019t know. She was like, just horrible for inexplicable reasons. Other than my mom. (pause) Yeah. But even she (pause) you know, she would never act like she was sad around us. But then she would talk about how depressed she had been in ways that were, in retrospect, not very <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201331\">appropriate. You know, act like she was going to kill herself. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: Oh. Like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: Until I was Actually, (pause) basically until I was an adult, and I decided I didn\u2019t care, I was terrified that she was going to kill herself. (pause) (chuckling) You know, and I still care, so... that\u2019s still there. (pause) Yeah, I definitely felt it was my job to care. But (pause) she wouldn\u2019t, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201371\">you know, it was when she got so she was doing better, then she would talk about how she had been really sad, and then she would share.

But I didn\u2019t know anybody else. (pause) I was so scared that somebody would find out, for years. But I don\u2019t know why. Like, why I get afraid to tell people anything. Or was it just me? I don\u2019t know. I feel like children are secretive about random things, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like the most important thing. Way more important than being well, or getting well or feeling better, was making sure nobody knew I wasn\u2019t well.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">Well, you know, I got bullied a lot, so... and that\u2019s how bullies work. They find the thing that hurts, and make it hurt more. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">Yeah, but it sucks that I wasn\u2019t good at sports. That made me sad. So then, they would make me feel worse about it. (pause) Or like, I didn\u2019t have clothes that fit. Or that needed cleaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: I sense in terms of kids at school, (pause) that doesn\u2019t (pause) it seems to me it cleared up with your parents or your therapist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Then I guess I imagine you were pretty sure that they would hurt you as well, if not intentionally, then sort of cruelly, like the other kids. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: But (pause) by (pause) seeing all the ways people do now, you can\u2019t know who\u2019ll care about you, and who\u2019ll hurt you and sometimes make you feel bad without trying to in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">THERAPIST: Maybe there\u2019s something there, though, because you\u2019re really terrified of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. I mean, I remember really distinctly telling my therapist that I had been playing basketball and nobody passed to me the entire day, and that made me really upset, and then I felt really horrible, and I was just really sad all the time. And I was in seventh grade, and I haven\u2019t seen <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201551\">that same woman since I was seven. So like, five years. (pause) Um, I can\u2019t remember what we talked about, or anything. (chuckling) You know, she had some games, and so I wanted to play the games all the time, and so we played games sometimes. But I don\u2019t remember. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">I remember her telling me once in like, eighth grade, that if you look up at the ceiling, it\u2019s easier not to cry.

You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Other than the things we\u2019ve brought up, like, are bad, but (pause) you\u2019re really wound up about it, it seems to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I honestly have no idea to what extent my parents and the therapist knew that I was depressed up until I... I just don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">You know, they put me on Paxil when I was in the sixth grade, so... Yeah, I was like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: They kept you going to therapy for eight years or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Clearly something was up. But I don\u2019t know, my dad just generally is of the opinion that therapy is good for people. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s terribly discriminating about like, who you go to therapy with or what kind of therapy? So like, I think he used to give Amanda a hard time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201731\">because she would get, like, would not get along with therapists, and would be, like, I don\u2019t want to see that person anymore. And (pause) that was not acceptable to him. Just like, really? (pause) But I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that was hard to hear, but (pause) usually even with a younger kid, and unquestionably with a kid who\u2019s in seventh or eighth grade, you\u2019ve got to tell them something about what\u2019s going on. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: They might have told me and I just didn\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe she did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: I mean... what do you mean, like, what about what\u2019s going on? Like what kind of information? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Whatever you think about what\u2019s going on, though. I mean, like, in the same way that I try to convey to you what I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: What you see out there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You would obviously put it differently to a kid, or (pause) but (pause) you don\u2019t just do an examination of the kid and then talk to the parents, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I remember talking with her a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t remember what we talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, maybe she did and for whatever reason you don\u2019t remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t know. (pause) Certainly I\u2019ve forgotten the \u201chere\u2019s what you\u2019re here to work on.\u201d Definitely. I mean, I don\u2019t know, maybe I viewed the list and \u201chere\u2019s what we\u2019ll work on, you not being so sad.\u201d (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: I think we talked a lot about my missing my mom, especially for the first couple of years. That was pretty brutal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And I kept, I kept thinking that I had some control over it, that if I complained enough that I knew things would change? Nope. (pause) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">I don\u2019t know exactly when I realized that that was never going to happen. Not just well, both, that was never going to happen, and that never could have happened. They were different. But, you know, I think \u201cthat was never going to happen,\u201d probably high school, and when I went to boarding school. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098836\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">You know, I wanted to like, get myself legally declared an adult so I could live with her.

Like, she didn\u2019t sue my dad over custody. She only said she wanted us to live with her, but I don\u2019t even know what that means. You know, she continues to maintain that she wanted us to live with her. But and she says that one of her big regrets <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B31\">is that she didn\u2019t push for custody.

Yeah, I mean, I would imagine it\u2019s an important part of it, but it\u2019s always like, how much did she want you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s gone in the past now, so you can look back and say, well, she can\u2019t put me before work and she can\u2019t, blah blah blah, and of course, but that can\u2019t feel good, I think it doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, and you know, it was really clear to me at first that she really wanted us, and like, Papa was the bad guy, and he was keeping her from having us?
