Also, I\u2019m always running five minutes late by this time on Mondays, so do you want to start at ten of? (both laugh) Then I\u2019ll be more on time. I don\u2019t like starting at a quarter of if I\u2019m really never, ever starting at quarter of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t really notice any more, so okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Some days I\u2019m on time, but on Monday I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Sounds good. (both laugh) How are you feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Better. Not over it, but better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Good. (pause)  I got to church at like 15 or 10 minutes before the service started and I went downstairs to see if Jared, who is the other guy who does the dinner afterwards, needs any help to make sure that everything was okay there. They were like, \u201cHey! You\u2019re here. We need to you loan tonight\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">to be a Eucharistic minister person \u201cand it\u2019s Palm Sunday, so we\u2019re doing all this crazy stuff and we need you to do that.\u201d And so I did. It was hard. It wasn\u2019t hard; it was more just like nobody had any idea what they were doing and I always feel sort of awkward about that. I think somebody, like one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">of the people who is supposed to serve and the one who was on it before, just had knee surgery and she fell and wrenched her knee, so she is out of commission for now. That was a little bit of a cluster fuck.  I grew up with Palm Sunday. My dad would usually get an actual donkey for the service and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">everyone would walk around outside and have a procession and waive palms around. It was supposed to be a little bit crazy. (laughs) (pause) Trinity tends to be a little bit . . . You know, there is a lot of fear in liturgy and they tend to want to have everything go off perfectly and that is sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">at odds with what I think it\u2019s for, but also it\u2019s very easy for me to be influenced by other people\u2019s desires in that way and to fret about doing everything right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I follow.  I think the focus on everyone getting everything right is that it\u2019s wrong-headed or (inaudible at 00:03:09)? It can still make you anxious to make you want to not have people be frustrated and disappointed when it\u2019s not turning out the way they wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. The whole congregation marched around town, waiving palms and singing, so that was really fun. (both laugh) (pause)  James and I talked about sex in couple\u2019s counseling today. That was sort of intimidating. (laughs) I don\u2019t know. (pause) I find it difficult to talk about, for reasons which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">are not that clear to me. I feel like I really shouldn\u2019t find it hard to talk about, but I do. (pause) It\u2019s hard for me to know that so much of my relationship with James is not in my control.  I need to do my best \u2013 and I do do my best \u2013 and look for ways to be a better partner and listen and try to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">figure out what\u2019s going on. But I sort of feel like we\u2019re coming up against over and over where I just have to let James decide whether he is going to trust me or not. I can do some things there, but I can\u2019t do a lot \u2013 or there is a lot that I can\u2019t do. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I had tea with John (sp?) on Saturday, a friend from (inaudible at 00:06:12). It was really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562468\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Is he the one who accidentally \u2013 or not accidentally \u2013 always screws everything up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes. [It\u2019s the same one who ruins everything.] (ph?) Yeah. (laughs) Broke Candace\u2019s foot, broke her heart, all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: By accident, maybe not so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I think it was by accident. He is this very charismatic, attractive person and I think he\u2019s sort of like me; he gets really excited about people at the beginning of a relationship, either a friend or a romantic relationship, and then I think for him \u2013 we ended up talking about this, actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">\u2013 he said he gets really, really into people and then it just sort of goes away and he just doesn\u2019t want to stay with them.  What do you do in that situation? And for Candace, I think he was really into her as a person, but he never wanted to be with her and I don\u2019t think he handled it all that well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t get married.\u201d (laughs) He is dating this woman and was talking about, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go ring shopping after this.\u201d That\u2019s the thing and it was weird to be talking with him about marriage and be, on the one hand, really excited for him and really pro-marriage and really excited about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">James and really just kind of loving James.  And all of a sudden I was like, \u201cYeah, he might leave me. I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to work or not.\u201d And for whatever reason, I was pretty fine saying all of those things and having all of those things be true and letting John know that all of those <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">things were true. So I feel good about that, but less good about the feeling that James basically is in the long process of deciding whether he wants to stay married to me or not.  (pause) (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">I think in some ways things have gotten easier for us, for James to be able to acknowledge that, I think. I\u2019ve had a few months to sort of sneak up to the idea \u2013 maybe sneak up is the wrong word \u2013 maybe edge up sideways while looking in the other direction. (chuckles)  I don\u2019t want that to happen. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">don\u2019t want to assume . . . (long pause) but I would survive it. (long pause)  I wonder on the one hand, I have the impulse to say, \u201cThis is sort of out of my hands. I just have to wait for something to make whatever internal change he is going to make.\u201d On the other hand, I sort of think maybe I\u2019m just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">trying to say \u201cit\u2019s out of my hands\u201d because I don\u2019t want to face the fact that I\u2019m failing at fixing this. (laughs) (pause) [It\u2019s all I\u2019ve thought of and have been talking about today.] (ph?)  (long pause)  I had a good week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: (inaudible at [0:14:27] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you may have brought up two things that you kind of want to talk about, but also maybe kind of really don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Things with James \u2013 what you can and can\u2019t be in control of \u2013 I guess especially with him, and what made talking about sex so difficult. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It feels less that I\u2019m afraid to talk about it or don\u2019t want to talk about it and more like I want to talk about it, but I don\u2019t really know where to start. I don\u2019t know what to say.  It\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a way in. I\u2019m not really sure I trust the feeling, though. (laughs) (long <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I have the impression that you want it from me and that it would make it easier, but I\u2019m only partially sure what it is. I think this is probably one of those things that you should talk about. I have some questions and kind of lead the discussion, in a way, or facilitate in order to help <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">you think and talk about it. I guess what I have in mind is that if I were to do something like that, that\u2019s what might put you at ease. So what I\u2019m trying to think about is why, because that might make clear what you\u2019re anxious about. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because you think it\u2019s something that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">find it was important to talk about or if it would feel like you were clear in where I was coming from because I was sort of facilitating your talking about it in some way, so I wouldn\u2019t feel quiet and predictable. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562468\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: (laughing) Quiet and unpredictable is a really good descriptor of how I feel about you a lot. (pause) I guess I worry that I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing and that I can\u2019t tell what that might be a lot of the time and that I\u2019m going to do some damage to you or to our relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re sort of in a mine field. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And when it comes to subjects like these, (inaudible at 00:20:16)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess I imagine my being unpredictable . . . (long pause)  Yeah, it doesn\u2019t make me think of the control thing because you are (inaudible at 00:21:15) we only partly know what we are saying. I\u2019m always going to find something which may be right or wrong or .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I can think of several different things that that might apply to. (laughs) Funny. (pause)  And that, in some ways, is one of the things that I find really, really appealing about this sort of therapy, but it\u2019s also sort of scary. I guess I find it sort of intellectually appealing and actually scary. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right. Sometimes those things hurt you a lot and you didn\u2019t see them coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)  I think also because you\u2019re a person, you can\u2019t actually not have any expression. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: So sometimes I do say things and your reaction makes me think this wasn\u2019t the right thing to say, for one reason or another. It\u2019s hard for me to tell to what extent that is sort of my own creation, probably a great deal, but there is. You\u2019re always going to give me something to work with; that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">sort of the point. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right. Even when somebody is on the couch, you still often give them, there is always something for them to work with.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: So I can\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to hit that and often I only feel like I notice that I\u2019ve hit it after the fact, like I\u2019ll go away and sort of dwell on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: When I said about being on the couch, did that a little bit . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: A little bit. I find it really scary to think about, actually. The couch scares the shit out of me and I don\u2019t know why because we tried it, right, in the very beginning?  It really scares me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You really don\u2019t ever have to use the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I know, but I don\u2019t actually know that. I don\u2019t know. (voice breaking) (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Okay. [I think it\u2019s] (ph?) separate from what scares you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I know. With how many of your patients do you use the couch \u2013 percentage-wise? (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562468\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:25:59) it could be hardly anybody; anybody but one.  (pause) I could imagine you feel like there already is a rupture in our relationship because you\u2019re not using the couch, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. Even if I say you don\u2019t have to, I think it would be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">better. You are terrified of it, for whatever reason, and so it\u2019s like you already feel like I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re doing a good job or not doing this right or something like that.  I imagine it\u2019s something along those lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like I know that none of those things are true, but that doesn\u2019t make it go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yes. (pause) I guess, in a way, you\u2019re saying you sort of have a condition that I think you\u2019re already doing things wrong, like some basic thing, in the wrong way.  My guess is that you feel I am probably distancing myself from you or being critical, if not about to call it quits or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t gotten that far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: I guess it feels like I\u2019m doing something fundamental really wrong; and so when things are hard for me, that must be my own fault. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: I imagine that\u2019s part of what would make it so hard to talk about; some of the things that came up earlier were similar to this. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess what I was thinking was you must feel like it\u2019s only a matter of time before it emerges how I think that you\u2019re doing something wrong.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: That makes sense. (pause) I get very frustrated because I want you to just tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong. (chuckles) Clearly it\u2019s lots of things.  (long pause)  I feel like I\u2019ve sort of lost track of our conversation. (long pause)  (crying) I just can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t get it right. (pause)  I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">can\u2019t figure out what right is. Last night, not only were they going to conscript me at the last minute, but I walked in like two-thirds of the way through them going over what was going to happen, so I missed instructions. (chuckling) (crying) I couldn\u2019t do it. (pause) It\u2019s not a big deal, but I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B2\">let it go. (crying) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You mean that you told them that you couldn\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: No, I couldn\u2019t do it right. I fucked up. Not in a big way, but [in some sort of an awkward reshuffling.] (ph?) (pause)  the best part is that I wasn\u2019t the person who messed up the most, by any means, by any stretch. (inaudible at 00:37:01) words of institution during the Eucharist. That\u2019 s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">the biggest part of the Eucharist, where you are being the body and blood of Jesus. (laughs) And it\u2019s the same words, all the different versions, and so the only part of the right that\u2019s the same, with all the different words that are said, you just messed it up. Once they came out, somebody else had <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">messed it up, and that\u2019s not a big deal for me. It\u2019s not a big deal at all. It\u2019s like \u2013 whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter. There are actually theological reasons why it doesn\u2019t matter, but I can\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t know.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I guess, in a sort of general way, it seems to me that as painful as this all is for you \u2013 and it seems very painful \u2013 there is kind of a distancing and protecting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562468\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: I suspect you do it, too, with me, like your conviction that you\u2019re doing this wrong and you\u2019re doing it probably wrong in a bunch of different ways. I felt pretty clear about that, too.  And for whatever reasons, which doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, I\u2019m not telling you; but I\u2019m thinking it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">and you know it. You feel awful about it; I think really ashamed, terrible, and that makes it hard to talk about stuff. (pause) It seems to me like a lot of pulling away on that part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: While I may focus on this, I don\u2019t have to actually talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: In this relationship, I\u2019m way back here in this sort of dark and painful corner with what I\u2019m feeling and thinking because really, the big story here is how you\u2019re doing this all wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: You are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not being very clear. What I have in mind is there is like a retreat involved in it, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure there is a lot more to say about it that I don\u2019t understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: I\u2019m actually still trying to figure out what you were talking about before.

There could well be more reality to it with you and James, but it\u2019s uncannily similar where I know I, Tanya, know and you, Chad, think that I\u2019m doing all these things wrong and you\u2019re not telling me or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">maybe vaguely indicating it in ways that I kind of read but that you\u2019re not owning up to. I, Tanya, and you, Chad, are not owning up to it explicitly.  At least to me, that is exactly how you talk about what happens with James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: No, that makes sense. (pause) It\u2019s tricky with James because I can see that it\u2019s the same way of talking about it. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s actually what James is doing, so it makes me feel like I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s coming from him and what\u2019s coming from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Right. That\u2019s why I say there may well be more reality to it.
