Sharon has a very bad cold, which means that I will have a very bad cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: That sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: But \u2013 you know \u2013 nothing yet. Sorry. I went to work for a couple of hours today. (inaudible at 00:01:14) (pause) And I\u2019m really tired. It\u2019s been harder to make myself go to bed and then go to sleep. I haven\u2019t felt tired, so I just haven\u2019t been sleeping much. I slept late today, so that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Sorry while it\u2019s occurring to me, before I forget \u2013 I think I can meet Friday of next week at noon, the 18th. Are you working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I will not be able to. I\u2019m not working, but it\u2019s Good Friday.  I\u2019ll be at church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. We went over this already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Would anything in the morning work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: All right. Let\u2019s try that then. (pause) Is it okay if I e-mail you with that next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like every week I\u2019ve been something like \u2013 well, this week is busy, but next week is going to calm down; and then it won\u2019t actually calm down because it\u2019s like every week is especially busy with things that don\u2019t happen every week, but then they keep coming.  (laughs) I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">Maybe this is what it feels like to be back in a normal life, but I\u2019m not sure I want that. (chuckles) (pause) [Keith] (ph?) was really pissy today. I picked him up from school and I\u2019m not really sure what it was. It was like he only wanted to play soccer and nobody else really wanted to play soccer <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">with him, so he was like, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll just make all of your lives miserable.\u201d (laughs) Some days I feel like I\u2019m good at derailing those kinds of bad moods that spread from kid to kid to me \u2013 or from me to the kids; that happens, too. \u2013 but today I\u2019m tapped out. I don\u2019t have any ideas for you. I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">help you not make everybody miserable as well as yourself here. Yeah.  (pause) Oh, well. (pause) I think this summer is going to be tricky, just in terms of getting the three of them into a rhythm where they will all play together; because [Paris] (sp?) and [Lydia] (ph?) are good about playing together <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200254\">at this point. Lydia and Sharon are typically good about playing when there isn\u2019t all three of them. It\u2019s not really going to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Is he at camp much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so. Actually, I don\u2019t know what their plans are for the summer. They weren\u2019t in camps last summer. I guess basically it\u2019s just me keeping them.  Oh, well. It\u2019s also hard because I don\u2019t see him as often anymore, so I don\u2019t know him quite as well as I know the other two at this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">point. We don\u2019t have a rhythm. (pause) I don\u2019t know. That seems to be more apparent to me than to him.  On the days when he is home and I\u2019m there, if I\u2019m looking something up on the computer he\u2019ll still come up and sit on my lap, which is a big deal for him because none of them are really touchy people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">They don\u2019t give hugs ever, basically. (laughs) I don\u2019t hug them. If I\u2019m sitting down they\u2019ll come and snuggle with me. I guess I feel like he\u2019s sort of developed a lot or grown up a lot at school and I haven\u2019t really had the chance to figure out how that\u2019s played out yet. I\u2019m not quite in tune with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">him; that remains to be seen.  (long pause) Yeah, if I\u2019m here this summer. (pause) (voice breaking) That also remains to be seen. (sighs)  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562464\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">It\u2019s also good because in some ways, I sort of like Sharon better than the other two at this point. I feel really bad about that and I\u2019m trying to figure out how to handle that.  At the same time, in some ways Sharon as a baby, needed minute-to-minute attention in the way that the others typically did <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">not. Sometimes she\u2019s sort of less that way now, but sort of still that way. She\u2019s 18 or 19 months, so it\u2019s like she\u2019ll spent half an hour just playing on the jungle gym by herself and doesn\u2019t want me to follow her and doesn\u2019t need me to hold her hand or anything. She\u2019s on the big kids\u2019 jungle gym by <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">herself at 18 months. She\u2019s pretty fearless. But then she gets tired and suddenly she really just does want me to hold her for the next 20 minutes and snuggle. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really know how to balance what the kids actually need and what do I want to do.  I don\u2019t know. This is one where being <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">the nanny is really nice because I\u2019m like well, even if I do show a decided preference for one of them, it\u2019s not going to follow them so much. (both laugh) The damage I can do here is limited. (pause)  The last two nights, Frank has gotten back before Kim and I\u2019ve gone to go home and have given Sharon <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B4\">a to Frank. She\u2019s been really upset about that. That hadn\u2019t happened for a while and I thought that she was over that phase. I don\u2019t know what to do there. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I just have some feedback. The first one is I wonder a little bit about the way you feel like the closeness that you have with her is going to hurt somebody else, like relationships with Frank, I think. You also seem to be talking about, I think, stuff with them in a bit of a different way <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">\u2013 sort of closer to some of the things that are happening. I don\u2019t know, a little more intimate in the way you\u2019re describing things with them to me, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I don\u2019t quite understand what you mean. I guess the way you say that I\u2019m like yeah, there is some sort of different quality in the way that I\u2019m talking about this, but I can\u2019t really articulate what it is or I don\u2019t feel like I have a sense of what it is, if that makes sense. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">do feel like I am attached to Sharon and she\u2019s attached to me and I can\u2019t think of that outside of \u201cthis is really going to hurt somebody,\u201d in that sense.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I read an article in NPR about childhood amnesia, like at what point children start forgetting things when they\u2019re very young. It\u2019s very interesting. I was thinking about that in the context of \u201cI can\u2019t make it so bad with Sharon because she\u2019s not going to remember me.\u201d And that will be fine. But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">was also talking with a friend who says that she has quite clear memories of being very, very young and talking about why that was. I also have a few memories of being well below the threshold of which we are supposed to be at when we remember, but I never really know how much I trust those.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">I was at a meeting for church last night and one of the things that I do is called healing prayer ministry. Have I talked about this? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562464\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: I feel a little awkward talking about it with you. I just feel awkward talking about it with people who aren\u2019t in church with me because I feel like it\u2019s a little weird. Anyway \u2013 at one of the services, basically people can come up and pray for healing or for things that they are having trouble <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">with or any issue, sort of like one-on-one with some people; you sort of put their hands on their shoulders and say something about it, talk about it, and pray together. That\u2019s a way of being in prayer together and also the priest, who is also the contact person, talks a lot about it being a safe place <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">for touch and that most people don\u2019t get very much touch or many people don\u2019t get very much touch in their lives and this is a safe place for that.  And this is really good. It really means a lot to me and it is really hard, but it is just a great thing for me to do and I feel really good about it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200373\">I am increasingly realizing that I don\u2019t frame it in the same way as the other people who are members and who are doing this. I\u2019m not comfortable thinking about it in the same way. (pause) I guess what it comes down to is talking about God as an active agent in what you\u2019re doing. People say, \u201cWe\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200374\">not doing anything; the Holy Spirit is coming through us.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: The people putting their hands on you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I sort of want to say yes and no to that. I don\u2019t know. (pause) I guess I just feel like I never really hit the bottom of how complicated people are (laughs), which I\u2019m sure is totally shocking to you. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: My inclination is to say \u201cyou and me both.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that was my thought.  I have days, particularly when I\u2019m feeling tired and ragged and not like I have a whole lot to give, where the process of listening to what somebody is going through and sitting with them and saying something about it, like talking to God and praying about it, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">I think it\u2019s both ways. You talk to God, but I think it\u2019s important to say something so that people can understand that you\u2019ve heard them and that you have some sense of what is going on. That\u2019s really hard for me, but I think I\u2019m pretty good at it.  I also have the experience of walking away at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">end of the evening and thinking that what happened there doesn\u2019t have a lot to do with the resources that I had to offer at the beginning of the evening, like I felt tapped out when I went in and then, somehow, it worked anyway. I\u2019m not really the sort of person who will then be like, \u201cOh, clearly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F3\">it\u2019s Jesus.\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s mysterious, but not necessarily that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. (pause) I\u2019m also not inclined to say that there must be a rational explanation somewhere and if I can\u2019t come up with one, then I\u2019ll just have to leave it unexplained, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking about the first part where you said you\u2019re not one to say that there must be a rational explanation, but I get the part about if you can\u2019t find one, leaving it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: There is an author, Barbara Ehrenreich. She\u2019s sort of an atheist and was raised by atheists. She\u2019s publishing a memoir about having mystical visions and trying to explain that. I really want to read it, but I haven\u2019t already. I had an interview with her and she was sort of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">to believe something; I want to find out the answer.\u201d  That made a lot of sense to me, but I also feel like the reason that I started believing in God was because I had mystical experiences. I feel like if you have to go around three corners to get to the place that you can see already \u2013 what am I saying? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">The image I have in mind is that you are standing and you see an answer, but that doesn\u2019t look like the right answer so you have to go around the block in order to get an answer that makes more sense to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562464\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Occam\u2019s razor, I think; It\u2019s good to start with the simplest explanation. Something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)  I guess what I mean is if I feel like something really fantastic is happening with this person that I\u2019m praying with and it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s coming from me, I don\u2019t want to say that it\u2019s obviously coming from God; but I also don\u2019t want to say obviously it\u2019s coming from me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">and I\u2019m just not aware of it. I don\u2019t know. I feel like the more I talk, the less clear I\u2019m getting in my own mind. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You seemed anxious about mentioning you had mystical experiences as a kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: And as a teenager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: And maybe also anxious, I think, about what you\u2019re saying about what\u2019s called a healing ministry; I think you\u2019re pretty open to the possibility that somebody is coming through you. You\u2019re not jumping on that prospect, but I think you\u2019re saying you\u2019re open to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Which also may make you feel anxious about saying. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve got it right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like I start out often with two thirds of what I want to say clear in my head and I start talking in the hopes that the other third will sort itself out; and sometimes that happens and sometimes I realize that actually, no, I had about one-third clear. (chuckles) And that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">makes me anxious.  (long pause)  Sometimes I think this is one of the best things that I do, but being in the room with all the other people who do it, I just feel weird and awkward and I\u2019m really not on the same page as these other women. There are a couple of men, but none of them were there last night. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry. You mentioned something before about how it\u2019s different for them. Could you remind me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: They tend to talk a lot about what God is doing in there as though they know exactly what it is or as though it\u2019s really clear to them where God\u2019s presence is and how it\u2019s operating.  I feel like in some ways it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s a little bit alienating, I just feel really judgy about that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">(laughs) I sort of feel like if you know exactly what God is doing, then you\u2019re wrong, really wrong somewhere. I don\u2019t really know what to do with that. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. I am just getting more and more anxious talking to you about this and I don\u2019t know why.  I keep thinking it will start making <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">sense and it doesn\u2019t. (sighs) (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You sound very frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: That you can\u2019t just be clear about it and speak your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562464\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: (crying) I\u2019m really scared that I can\u2019t fix this.  (crying continues) (long pause) Sorry. I\u2019ve got an eyelash . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s okay. (long pause)  One thing I got out from what you said was the way they\u2019re talking about Got coming through them and how they\u2019re saying it, they\u2019re not talking like people who are really being moved. It sounds very conceptual and concrete or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so. No. (pause) I don\u2019t know.  Simplistic is the word that comes to mind, but I don\u2019t quite know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: Are you afraid of sounding like them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But also of not sounding like them, depending on the context.  (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What do you mean about not sounding like them? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: I feel like there is sort of a mental reservation that is pretty common for the liberal Protestant intellectual types to be like, \u201cWell, you know. I go to church, but not really ever to talk about God or not really ever to want to have God be real.\u201d I sort of think that\u2019s really bad for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">church and intellectually I don\u2019t agree with that, but that is also really where I\u2019m comfortable living (inaudible at 00:38:29).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: [My image is that that\u2019s culturally what a person is comfortable with, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re experiencing.] (ph?) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Sorry. (long pause)  I guess what we talk about faith, there is always this sort of part of me listening to what I am saying and saying \u201cyou sound like a crazy person. (laughs) This doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201d (long pause)  Sort of the obvious solution to that is don\u2019t talk that much about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">it, but in here I sort of start talking about it. (laughs) (pause) I don\u2019t know. (pause) Sorry \u2013 I just thought . . . This is the place where Sharon wiped her nose on me. (both laugh) (long pause)  [It\u2019s just that same intimate chess towards the beginning] (ph?) describing the mother who is severely <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">afraid of germs and disease and her toddler comes up and has this giant, disgusting mold that he had eaten part of. He holds it out to her and is like \u201cI ate this.\u201d I was describing what you do when your toddler gives you something \u2013 you take it, like spit up food \u2013 you catch it. (pause)  Sorry, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200733\">getting all (inaudible at 00:44:18). Like when she spits up food, I\u2019m like \u201chere\u2019s a napkin.\u201d If there is any food or drink spilled, she will insist on cleaning it up right away, but she can\u2019t even take one bite without spilling something. (both laugh) It can be extra frustrating during means. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s just too apt, I mean to say, I imagine to describe how you\u2019re feeling, like you don\u2019t want there to be anything messy, but you keep on spilling. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: That is pretty good (inaudible at 00:45:41). (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: I guess what\u2019s unclear to me is what the danger is, like whether you feel like you\u2019re saying anything gross or making some kind of a mess or feeling like a mess or talking \u2013 whatever it is, it seems to be making you anxious, but I guess that\u2019s the piece that isn\u2019t always as clear.
