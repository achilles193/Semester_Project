Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: And, let's see I, over the next two months expect to sort of fairly often to have some openings on Wednesday morning early-ish.

I'm having a tough day. I'm sending Jason cookies and my mom her birthday present. Which I've been trying to do for Denver actually, but haven't been able to make happen and I sort of melted down with James today, this morning. So the good news is, the insurance <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">has already processed the claims from April, which is amazing except for two, inexplicably who knows. The bad news is that for half of them they sent us the process claim but they didn't send us a check, so I was calling asking what's going on with that and it seems like they sent the check separately <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">and just who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I got a bunch of the sort of the type of paperwork that usually indicates they're sending claims and the check to somebody, in any case, not sending it to me. But anyway if they put a check in their maybe I can just sign it over to you (unclear) I can do that (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I really appreciate that.

On the other hand, James keeps our accounts and so James is the person who has been handling the lot of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">but I'm the person who calls the insurance company. And I just can't do what he wants me to do and I can't they tell me there's nothing we can do which is usually a lot because what they always say and I believe them. But that's not good enough for James but I also don't want to say well, you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">call the insurance company because I don't want to add yet more to the list of things that he does for me. I just feel like I can't get it right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">(Pause): [00:06:55 00:07:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: They tell me you're screwed and there's nothing we can do and I say, oh, okay, that's sounds familiar. Of course, that's sort of how it always goes and of course one tends to say, no, of course there's something you can do. But I don't know how to make that happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: It seems like part it seems to me like part of the pattern of me feeling like I can't be what James wants me to be and do things right for him and I'm pretty sure that's not James being picky or controlling. I'm pretty sure that's me. But I can't shake it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559774\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">(Pause): [00:08:30 00:09:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Work's fine. Overall, I think they're probably happy with me. But I can't feel like I'm doing a good job. I think I'm actually doing pretty well but I can't make that count for anything. The kids are really interesting. (Laughs) The five-year-old, Jackson (sp?) seems like every couple of days <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">will do something that's like deliberately egregious to see what I'll do. So I like stop, and hold hands and we go out into the parking lot and he looks at me and he walks out of the parking lot. Or like, don't kick you sister and he kicks his sister and he looks at me. And he knows I do whatever I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">do send him up to his room or I did yell at him in the parking lot. I said, 'Jackson' like very loudly and I went over and grabbed onto him and sat down and said, okay, this is why you absolutely have to look at me when I say that. Period. But it's like for the rest of the day after that he not only <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200473\">like mostly does what I ask him, more or less for a five year old, (Laughs) but like he has gone out of his way to be helpful for me like cleaned up the room, like cleaned up their toys without really being asked or and I don't know I just think that's hilarious. And it's good to know, like okay, it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200474\">like he wants to know that there are going to be consequences if he messes with me so wants to trust me in a way.

Like just three days nonstop and then four days to not be working. (inaudible) pick apart every interaction and I shouldn't have done it that way, I should have done it this way. I should have done that. Maybe Jackson hates <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">me. Maybe when he's really old enough to have the option of not adoring someone who is with him for a long period of time, who pays attention to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(Pause): [00:13:29 00:13:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I saw on Facebook yesterday that a guy from my department graduated with his PhD and I was very jealous and on the page someone asked him what's next? and he said, well, I'm working at Apple and applying for adjunct positions and I (laughs) still feel bad but reaffirmed that I should have left. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">It just really, really hurts.

And he's not okay with me and he's (crying) really angry with me and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">it was too much for him and (crying) -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559774\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">(Pause): [00:32:33 00:32:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: But I guess I'm mad at him because he could have just believed me.

I don't know. You know, like I think it's a case of I am more than usually anxious because I feel like whenever I do something to irritate him that, you know, there's this huge big thing that he's upset with me about behind that and also he feels like I can't do anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F91\">right. And I think for him like you know, I think he's just really sad, himself, and so more like, irritable, than usual and will snap at me and then it's like everything that I do that irritates him, there's also that. 'Oh, and by the way, my life is in this place I really don't want it to be and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F92\">I was terrified that you were going to kill yourself for this long period of time and I feel hurt and betrayed by that.'

You know, like it's perfectly bad, and this causes it and that causes it, you know what I'm saying? And it wasn't so monolithic and so inevitable, so it wasn't monolithic and inevitable. And I know there's some reality to what you're saying and everything, and it is, but in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201032\">a way it sounded like you cast it as being exactly what you feared but I guess it kind of seems to me you didn't. I mean, It wasn't in things you said that things are not okay between the two of you, that he's probably resentful, he's reassessing it in some ways, but when you said he's not leaving or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201033\">putting everything on the table, and he's upset with you and there's this giant thing but to be honest, there was that giant thing the whole time. And there may be more reality clearly there's more reality to it now in view of what he's telling you how he's reacting, but I'm pretty sure you felt that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201034\">giant thing even when he was telling you it was okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559774\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: Yes.
