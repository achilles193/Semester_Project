Probably other aspects that aren't really other aspects that aren't but I think one kind of strand in this. It is a kind of reaction to what happened yesterday which I gather you moved away from in a sense pretty quickly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">on your way home thinking that the thing you had to do is really to kill yourself which was better than thinking about, I guess, some of the things we talked about. And also the way it felt like I did something very hurtful to you, which I know you know in another sense is not true in saying some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F2\">the things that I did. And I guess I feel like one thing that probably is exceedingly hard for you here today is like letting me know that. [0:25:12] And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: The thing is I guess it was hurtful. But it felt more like... it felt like a relief at the time, honestly. For you to be like, \"Yea, no wonder you're not doing very well with this. You're not equipped to do very well with it.\" So it was sort of like getting my feet knocked out from under me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">But I'm also like bad in this situation and so it is a relief to have it acknowledged. [0:26:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">Yea, but it certainly did not make me feel better in other ways. Certainly did not help my project of keeping it together.

[0:27:01] (pause) I hope you won't give up and kill yourself.

It's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yea. That people would say it (inaudible at 0:29:30). (pause) I feel sort of like when both of your feet ache and you keep shifting weight from one to the other. But it doesn't help because they both ache. [0:30:06] But I can't figure out a way to keep moving forward. And I can't figure out a way to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:30:20) it just hurts in each way you try and do it.

(pause) It's not like this is even being fair. I find myself going crazy by rationalizing to killing myself trying to find ways to make it OK. It's too easy to tell emotionally.

But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Being that they have to be pulled?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yea.

[0:38:11] Or protective of me or reflective of like a failure in my work or some kind of privacy issues?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: I was thinking of it in terms of a privacy issue. (pause) Yea. (pause) [0:39:00] It's difficult mental exercise to imagine what would be like to kill myself. So I don't know what I... it was just indicative that I'm trying to get control over this in some way or another. That I feel like wow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">I'm going to kill myself.

A minute ago you said that they have some [fussy legal clause] (ph). But that doesn't make sense. Well like OK. Well, the fantasy doesn't make sense and I don't want pursue it because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Yea. Because it better make sense.

(pause) The upcoming break from our meeting is scaring the shit out of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yea. It's scary and that's when I'm home alone, I'll think about it. I just don't know what's going to happen. So I can see it being not a problem at all. I can see it being very problematic. I just don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yea. [0:43:00] What's going on the rest of the day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: I have an appointment with Dr. Vaughn at 5:15.

No. But I do get picked up a (inaudible at 0:43:21). So that's good. I need to schedule a time to meet with that guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see. So they like sort of accept you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yea, yea. I applied to them and they... yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And you're not working today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: No. I work tomorrow morning early. I told the guy I'd be OK until (inaudible at 0:43:48) with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Why is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: It's unclear. He went to the library because he's got allergies from the building. [0:44:02] So maybe I will talk to him after my meeting with Dr. Vaughn. Maybe before that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Will you be home before the meeting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Probably but not necessarily. (pause) It's probably safer for me to be at (inaudible at 0:44:26) than at home especially home alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I wouldn't want to make a mess in public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Why don't if you're going to go home why don't you send me a text and let me know how you're doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: OK. I can also just call James (ph) and ask him to come home with me. [0:45:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: I will do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: We'll stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
