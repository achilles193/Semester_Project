I\u2019m just... I glad you were able to come in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It was probably a best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) So, yeah. No, I mean, things are a little weird because I had, we had our first mediation on Monday. So I, you know... It was weird because... (PAUSE) He... We had talked about like just using the mediator, like let\u2019s avoid having like lawyers  And so (PAUSE) when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">got there, we had our full financials in front of each other and he had a lawyer. Like it showed that he had a lawyer and I didn\u2019t know that. So I was like, \u201cOh, you have a lawyer?\u201d And he was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d And so... And he was like completely much more prepared than I was because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">he had like... You could tell he had like talked to his lawyer and like knew what to say and like how to propose things to me. And I was just very anxious the whole time, like getting there because I didn\u2019t know how it was going to be. I mean, she was very helpful. You know, she started off just like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">You know, she was like, \u201cI\u2019m not here to give advice. I\u2019m here to help you through the process like, you know, to understand the proceedings and things and make this amicable or whatever.\u201d So it wasn\u2019t like he and I were like... We didn\u2019t like yell or get mad at each other. And we agreed on most things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And like, you know, the custody, you know, the way we\u2019re doing it is fine, you know, alternating holidays. Although, you know, he was really insistent on having Christmas. And, you know, I really wanted to keep Christmas because we\u2019ve had Christmas... My son\u2019s thinking he\u2019s staying (inaudible) Christmas. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">But he just wouldn\u2019t really give up on that. So we kind of tabled that for a little bit. But like other things like... So we talked about like support for Brady (ph), like child support and, you know... She, the mediator was kind of like, \u201cYou know, what are you thinking?\u201d And I just was like, \u201cI don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">have enough money right now to like sustain both of us, you know, like in an apartment that\u2019s just rent and all that.\u201d And so he was kind of like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll offer to pay for his school.\u201d Which is... So it\u2019s hard because it\u2019s like I was really, I was very stressed and anxious about money and so when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">he said that, it was really big relief. So I was like, \u201cThat\u2019ll be great.\u201d Like I kind of just like was like, \u201cYes. That would be great.\u201d And so he he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ll pay your share of his daycare and then I\u2019ll pay all school tuition up until college and then at college we\u2019ll split it.\u201d And so I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200234\">\u201cOkay.\u201d Like I think I was just relieved that I was getting something that I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And then... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And then later, when I left... It was like after I left when I was like, \u201cWhat the hell did I just...\u201d I mean, I didn\u2019t sign anything. But I just was kind of like, \u201cWhat did I just agree to?\u201d Because, you know, we pay for daycare now which is the most expensive thing. But when he goes to Kindergarten <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">next year, it\u2019s like free. So... And then I... I didn\u2019t know if I was really getting anything out of it. You know? Because I\u2019m also splitting everything else equally. Like we... He would pay for school tuition and then all other Brady expenses are split equally. And I was kind of like, \u201cI don\u2019t think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">I\u2019ll have enough money to like send him to camp.\u201d You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562648\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">So... (PAUSE) That was after I left. So I was like, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d And then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: And what about alimony?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: So we talked about alimony and he was... Well, before we got to alimony... We agreed on other things like we would split health insurance. Retirement... I had more retirement than he does. But he was like, \u201cJust forget about it. It\u2019s like a wash. It\u2019s not that big of a...\u201d Because I think I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">had like $20,000 more than he does in his account. So he was just like, \u201cForget it.\u201d So before we got to alimony, we got to debt. So, you know, I was... I noted the amount of debt we had. And he was like, \u201cWell, I gave you $2,000.\u201d And the debt is like $15,000 in... (PAUSE) You know, I just was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">\u201cThat\u2019s not... That\u2019s not enough. That\u2019s, you know...\u201d So he was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve thought about it so what I\u2019ll do is pay for half of anything up until you left.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">So since then I have charged like $3,500 because I had to buy furniture and movers and... And I was like, \u201cYou won\u2019t consider splitting that?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, no because, you know, you left.\u201d And so the mediator was like, \u201cWell, let\u2019s consider the furnishings in your condo. Is there a value to that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">that Penelope (ph) should have because (PAUSE) you know, he has...\u201d He kept everything most basically, 95% of everything or 90%. (PAUSE) And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, what do you mean?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, you have the Pottery Barn table, the (inaudible) furniture, the, all the electronics, the Mac computer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">You kept...\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you have the diamond ring. So it\u2019s kind of equal.\u201d And I just like... (SIGH) It\u2019s hard because I\u2019m like... [0:08:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">I\u2019m not like a fighter. I\u2019m not one to like get angry and stuff. But... (PAUSE) So it\u2019s like... I just didn\u2019t say anything because I didn\u2019t want him to take these because I need them to sell them. (CRYING) He was like... I was like... I said, \u201cI just don\u2019t have any more money other than the card.\u201d The <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">card was almost like maxed and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t have a dining table for Brady to like eat at.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll pay for half of a dining table from Ikea.\u201d And of course I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d You know, I was just like, again, relieved he was giving me something. And, you know, the mediator <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">was trying. But she was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ll pay for the whole thing?\u201d Like she... (PAUSE) And he was like, \u201cNo. I\u2019ll pay for half.\u201d And so... (PAUSE) Then he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ll pay for half of the credit card debt from when she left.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And then we got to alimony and he was like, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have to pay alimony. I wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d And she was like, \u201cWell..\u201d I guess child support you can\u2019t waive but alimony you can. So she was like, \u201cYou know, Penelope can choose to waive the alimony or...\u201d You know, usually alimony is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">like 30% of your salary. And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, at this point if I\u2019m paying half the credit card bill and, you know, the tuition, I don\u2019t really have any more money to give.\u201d And... (PAUSE) I just was like... You know, I was kind of just being like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have... You know, right now I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">have a car payment because the car is paid off and I\u2019m living in a one bedroom apartment.\u201d But I was like, \u201cEventually I\u2019m going to have to have car payment and eventually I have to get a two bedroom so Brady has his own room. I don\u2019t have enough money to do that.\u201d And so he was... You know, he\u2019s a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">finance guy and so he negotiates... His job is to like negotiate money for (inaudible). That\u2019s what he does. He travels and he negotiates business things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562648\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">So he was just like... He goes, \u201cWell, how about this? How about if I pay... I\u2019ll off all your debt so you don\u2019t have...\u201d Because I also said... I was like, \u201cAnd then I have to pay the credit card bills.\u201d You know, he was like, \u201cI\u2019ll pay off all your debt if you waive alimony.\u201d And... (PAUSE) And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">was like... You know, I kind of was like... Because the idea of not having any debt is like wonderful. You know? But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: What is 30% of his income?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean, he makes 118. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019d be getting $30,000 a year. So do you have hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt... So obviously that\u2019s a better deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: And the way I saw it... I thought he should be paying half of the credit card debt anyway. So even if he paid half, then I\u2019m left with 7,500. And if I sold my diamond ring, I could pay that off. I would rather have a monthly check for the next however many years rather than just one lump sum <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">So... So I was just like, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d So he was like, \u201cWell, okay.\u201d And it was kind of the... I mean, we had gone through everything. Everything else was like agreed upon, like we were fine. It was just like those, the money thing. So the mediator was like, \u201cWell, let me just write everything up <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">and like have your...\u201d She looked at me. She was like, \u201cYou need to get a lawyer and have a lawyer look at this.\u201d I think she... I mean, she can\u2019t give advice. But you can tell she was a little concerned about what I was doing. You know? Like maybe like, \u201cYou\u2019re kind of screwing yourself a little bit.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">Because, at one point, Rich (ph) left to use the bathroom (PAUSE) and she was like, \u201cI know this must be really hard.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah. you know...\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m just really...\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to... I\u2019m not trying to bleed him dry with finances. Like I want him to have enough money for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D3\">Brady too.\u201d But I was like, \u201cI\u2019m just... I just want to have enough to like take care of my son.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not even going after like his trust fund or any of that stuff.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cAre you sure about that? Are you sure you want to like just completely give up on that?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">And then he walked in and she didn\u2019t say anything else. Like it was... (LAUGHTER) She was trying to tell me something and then like couldn\u2019t tell me anymore. So... (PAUSE) And, you know, he had me sign away like the hundred thousand dollar, what he calls loan from his parents like right after I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">told him about not wanting to be married. He was like, \u201cYou know that was a loan.\u201d I never understood it to be a loan. I was like, \u201cI thought they gave it to us.\u201d He was like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a loan.\u201d So... (PAUSE) \u201cYou know, you can\u2019t ask for that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562648\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: If it\u2019s not in writing, it\u2019s not a loan.

I mean, I guess the issue is what you\u2019re doing, what you\u2019re doing because you\u2019re really limiting yourself to be extremely vulnerable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: I am. I mean, it\u2019s hard because I feel like really guilty about stuff. (CRYING) So it\u2019s like... I\u2019m just like, \u201cJust take it.\u201d But then when I left, I was like... I don\u2019t have enough money. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">So it\u2019s like I\u2019m at this point where it\u2019s like, you know... I\u2019m fighting. I\u2019m in the process of getting a lawyer. But I don\u2019t want it to be like... You know, my friend who just got married, she\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, I know you want it to be amicable and fast and easy.\u201d But she\u2019s like, \u201cYou can\u2019t like allow <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">yourself to be screwed for Brady\u2019s sake. You know? And if it means you have an argument and, you know, end up going to court, then that\u2019s what you do. You know?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t just say yes because you feel bad or because you want it to be done.\u201d So... (PAUSE) I mean, he\u2019s not being like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">mean or anything. I think he\u2019s just... I think he just knew what to say and I was just so like, you know, like overwhelmed by the whole process. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">And then for the dog, I was just like, \u201cCan you contribute for the dog?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo.\u201d He was like, \u201cCan\u2019t you just give him away?\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d (PAUSE) So... (PAUSE) I mean, what I would like ideally is... I just need like a monthly check from him every day and I need him to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">pay half the... I mean, it would be nice if he proportionally paid off the debt, proportionally based on our income. But even half would be fine. You know?

Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: I mean, there\u2019s not that much that an attorney could do around that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: And so the fact that he\u2019s trying to not pay child support and just split the major cost...

(SIGH) You know, I know I need a... You know, because I\u2019m worried about paying the lawyer. My friend was like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s worth it. Figure out a way to pay it and then they\u2019ll help you in some way.\u201d I mean, he\u2019s just in a position where he makes more money and he <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">has a trust fund where his parents just take money out for him and his parents give him money. And I don\u2019t have... I don\u2019t have any of that back up at all. I don\u2019t have any cushion to like land on. (PAUSE) I mean, I\u2019ll sell my jewelry.

(PAUSE) I mean, it\u2019s not that he\u2019s not trying to give me anything. But he is... You know, it\u2019s weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">because he knows I don\u2019t have money but he knows I have Brady. So it\u2019s like... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know.

(PAUSE) And part of the, paying the debt was when we refinanced, he would get more <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">money for the credit card bills. (PAUSE) I mean, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be opposed to giving me a check instead. It\u2019s just the number, how much it\u2019ll be.

(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">(PAUSE) So I\u2019m not going to talk to him about it anymore.

I don\u2019t know if I can come like once a month until I know what\u2019s... I mean, I should know hopefully soon. But...

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: You can use that for this.
