And I was like, 'fine, let's watch it.' It wasn't very, it just wasn't great. I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">know, it just didn't go anywhere and it didn't feel inauthentic to me, I just felt like the show's writers didn't know what they were trying to say. I don't know. I mean it's like I don't really know because I can't talk to him about it. I feel like James is just afraid that he's going to come back <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">one day and I will have killed myself, which you know, I can see why one would not trust me given that and I can't promise him that I won't.

But I'm considering him a psychologist, somehow by calling like getting calls from like emergency calls from his patients came up and like what he said was like, 'well, if they're calling me, they don't want to die but they're still suicidal.' And everyone was like, 'huh?' Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">but I didn't want to say anything. I'm not quite sure why I thought of that. This was the same evening where another of the people I was hanging out with worked at [Frederick] (ph). So it was kind of a weird evening in that I don't know. Fortunately, nobody was that interested in listening to me. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">I was part of the conversation but nobody was relying on me to lead it.

So it's like I don't even notice it anymore. It's just like a baseline assumption. And so like I start thinking that things would just be better if I weren't part of the equation. But that's exactly the problem right now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">Like the fact that I think that is what is problematic.
