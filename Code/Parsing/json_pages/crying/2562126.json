It feels nice outside, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It\u2019s warming up again because tomorrow\u2019s supposed to be 50 and rainy all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: As opposed to negative 25 and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Which it was like yesterday, right? Super windy or whatever. And\u2026 or a thunderstorm, like on Saturday. Whatever. So I got home on Friday to\u2026 and I walked in\u2026 what the hell did I do on Friday. Oh, no, no. I just went home. Oh, because Mandy was in town because her great aunt passed away. So she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">was in town and she had finished all the family stuff and so we were doing a little girls\u2019 night at our friend Laurie\u2019s house, who\u2019s going through a divorce. She got married in April to her lesbian lover of years. But all of us knew that she wasn\u2019t a lesbian. [1:09] And it was only a matter of time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">And we just thought it would last at least\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: That Laurie wasn\u2019t or the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Laurie wasn\u2019t. She just wasn\u2019t. And I think that Isabelle was her first healthy relationship, she felt. And she felt like it was her best friend. And she wasn\u2019t honestly attracted to her so she ended up cheating on her with a guy who she\u2019s now having some crazy sex love affair with. Anyway, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">but it just further solidifies my feelings about marriage that I\u2019ve been having lately, that it\u2019s just kind of meh. Do what you can. Whatever. Sometimes shit falls apart. Although I have to say, Laurie, a month or couple of weeks after getting married, was posting on Facebook I just want\u2026 something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">like I just want to say, ten years from now 90% of you\u2026 everybody here who\u2019s getting married right now will be divorced. I\u2019m the other 10%. [2:03] And it was like really Laurie? It was obnoxious in and of itself and now it\u2019s even worse because anybody who was offended by that who\u2019s married, like Noah <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">for instance, he took huge offense to it and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because he\u2019s also not as secure in his marriage, and\u2026 the same as Laurie was, which is\u2026 the only reason why people feel that she\u2019d say that kind of stuff, I think, are now probably going to be like ha, ha, which they shouldn\u2019t but anyway. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">anyway, we went and did that on Friday night and that was lovely, but I got home first because\u2026 and I had a really big stomach ache because I had a burrito at 2:00, 3:00, and it really didn\u2019t sit well. And now I think I can ever eat there again just because my stomach was killing me. Anyways, so I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200195\">laying\u2026 I was planning on going home and relaxing for a little bit. I walk in, Helen\u2019s laying on the couch, obviously, and she presses pause and I\u2019m like hey, and she\u2019s like hey. I\u2019m like\u2026 she\u2019s like how\u2019s it going. I\u2019m like good, pretty good. I have a thousand bags, whatever. She\u2019s like so I got fired <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200196\">today. And I was like fucking fabulous. I was like oh, my God, what happened. And she was a contract position and I guess they had kept extending the contract as much as they could, and then finally they had no work for her so they were like we can\u2019t keep you on. [3:17] And so they laid her off and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What does she do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: She... graphic design and web design. And so, right, and so it\u2019s like oh my God. And she\u2019s like oh, well the temp agency\u2026 the agency that got\u2026 is usually pretty quick to get me jobs. That\u2019s who gave her this job and the job she had before. And I was like oh, that\u2019s good. Well that\u2019s hopeful. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">And you can be applying to other jobs in the meantime. And she was like\u2026 I was like oh, is it the type of agency that will give you\u2026 that will call you if they have one day jobs that pop up or whatever? Because\u2026 and I was basically saying when I was unemployed I would take every job that came my way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">so if somebody called with a one day secretary job\u2026 she\u2019s like yeah, they do, but I\u2019m really trying to stay away from those one day jobs and just concentrate on full time. And all I could think was no, yeah, you concentrate on a full time while you take the one day jobs because $50 in your pocket is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">better than zero bucks. And so that infuriated me, obviously. And then she was like but I\u2019ve decided to just take Saturday and Sunday to just relax and let it sink in, then I\u2019m going to get on it. And I was like cool. And then she said that she has enough, she thinks, to last her maybe through half <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">of next month. I was like awesome, sounds like you shouldn\u2019t be hitting the streets looking for any kind of paying job that you can. So she did exactly that, she laid on the couch all weekend, and then went to her friend Lucy\u2019s house last night. And I think was going to her parents\u2019 house to use their <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">computer or get a computer. And of course I offered her to let her use my laptop. She doesn\u2019t have a fucking laptop? I hate living with her. And things were getting better, and they feel a little better, but I don\u2019t want to live with somebody who can lose their job. I don\u2019t want to live with somebody <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">who doesn\u2019t have a laptop. I don\u2019t want to live with somebody\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t have any kind of savings so if I got fired I\u2019d be fucked, but I am not going to get fired. [5:19] So it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, it just feels more reasonable to not have a backup. And in her case she should\u2019ve. And I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D7\">I\u2019m not\u2026 it\u2019s just like really? The shit storm doesn\u2019t stop it feels like. It just feels like every time I start to breathe and relax something else comes up that I feel anxious about or feel like\u2026 or could affect my life or will affect my life or whatever. I mean because if she can\u2019t pay the rent I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D8\">don\u2019t know if he\u2019d kick both of us out. We\u2019re both on the lease. I then have to fucking ask my father for money, which I haven\u2019t done for months and months and months. Find another roommate. I mean whatever, I would rather get a new roommate but at the same time it\u2019s just\u2026 feels like another fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D9\">thing I have to think about and that I just can\u2019t feel that relaxed in my everyday life. I mean yeah, I know it\u2019s her job and it\u2019s her problem, but we\u2019re sharing a house right now. [6:20] So I\u2019m not\u2026 and then Saturday I started\u2026 what the hell did I do? (pause) I don\u2019t know what happened. I got up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D10\">did nothing for a little while or something, and then I got a message from this guy. [6:48] So there was a lot of match.com activity because I changed my profile a little bit, and every time you change your profile you start popping up at the top of searches. When people search certain criteria, if <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D11\">you are in that criteria you\u2019ll be at the top of the search list because you\u2019ve just changed your profile. So whenever I change my profile I always get a ton of new people winking at me or whatever the fuck they do. And so this guy messaged me or something, and he has a similar profile, Jewish, Aquarius, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D12\">said something similar, whatever. And I was like meh. So I\u2026 he messaged me, I messaged back, and I was like here\u2019s my number because I really don\u2019t like the whole e-mailing back and forth. I don\u2019t have time for that, just\u2026 let\u2019s cut to the chase. I mean, I don\u2019t know, the whole getting to know you\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D13\">because then if you do spend all this time e-mailing and then you do go meet and you\u2019re like meh and then he\u2019s like what\u2019s up. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019d rather just meet. [7:43] But anyway, so maybe\u2026 anyway, so I asked him and he\u2026 I was like here\u2019s my number, just let me know if you\u2019d like to grab <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D14\">a coffee or a drink some time. And he said sure. So then he texted me and asked if I wanted to go tomorrow, Tuesday. This was on Saturday. And he said\u2026 I was like sure. And he said\u2026 asked if 8 was okay; I said sure, and then he said okay, what about dinner. And I went ballistic. I called my mom and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D15\">was screaming, crying, I don\u2019t understand. Why isn\u2019t there anybody normal? Why aren\u2019t normal people messaging me? What the fuck. Who the fuck would choose a chain restaurant in a fucking mall for a first date? What are we, in the Midwest? I was just all in a tizzy about it. And she listened and told <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D16\">me to calm down and then was like I think that, yes, you can cancel if you don\u2019t want to go out with him if he would choose those places for a first date. And then I asked Stephanie, also. I\u2019m like\u2026 I said\u2026 and she immediately\u2026 I mean her immediate... yes, cancel. Because it shows a fundamental\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562126\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">CLIENT: \u2026difference. I don\u2019t know, you just\u2026 we\u2019re going to have a first date with a fucking kid screaming about dumplings behind us? It\u2019s a\u2026 he may as well have said fucking Applebee\u2019s for all I care. [9:03] Fucking Ground Round. And then I felt bad and then I felt guilty. What if he just doesn\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">and I\u2019m being such a bitch. I\u2019m like poor guy, maybe he thought that\u2019s a nice restaurant. But then at the same time I\u2019m like why should I feel bad? I don\u2019t want to date somebody who would feel that that\u2019s appropriate for a first date with somebody you don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t. And I think that\u2019s okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200212\">There\u2019s 1000 other places in that vicinity even, if that\u2019s what he was going for, easy parking. But not even, because I have to go into a fucking garage and pay and the whole\u2026 anyway, I got all upset about it and screamed at my mom. And then\u2026 but this is where this\u2026 Diane, she\u2019s noticing it, and I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200213\">noticing it, that first of all when she told me to calm down, I actually did. When she was like step back, yes, cancel the date and move on, I was able to do that. Secondly I have been revving up to do my little workout thing for the day and so I was on the phone with her and I stopped crying and was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200214\">calmed down and was like listen, I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got to work out right now before I lose it, and was able to work out. And I cleaned the house and put all of that energy and frustration into doing something that made me feel good. And then at the end of the cleaning and working out it was\u2026 I took <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200215\">a nice shower. It was 6:00. I made some pasta, spent the night on the couch watching a movie. And it was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562126\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20023\">THERAPIST: You recovered pretty well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it was awesome. And I had a really nice night. And I was supposed to go out but my friend\u2019s daughter was feeling sick so she couldn\u2019t go. And it ended up being fine because it was that thunderstorm, and I was happy to be on the couch. But it was really noticeable that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s terrific.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, so that was great. And\u2026 because I think prior I would\u2019ve\u2026 that really just would\u2019ve ruined my entire day and I just would\u2019ve been having a really hard time to get out and probably would\u2019ve been on the couch smoking for the rest of the day. Or something. Or eating or whatever. And that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200291\">was great. And then Sunday morning I woke up bright and early to get a workout in before we were going to meet up with my family for brunch for Jesse\u2019s birthday, which was on Thursday. He turned 14. He chose IHOP. [11:11] I guess, I don\u2019t know, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s 15.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I know, I\u2019m just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. In that context, yes. Well, but I don\u2019t know why Tracy and Dad let him choose it. Why wouldn\u2019t they be like no, Jesse, you\u2019re\u2026 sorry. The pancakes are not even that good there. If you want chocolate chip pancakes you can get them anywhere, better. There were two chocolate chips in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">his pancakes. Anyways, so my mom and I went and picked up Michael, and then we\u2026 and it was fairly convenient because the IHOP\u2019s over there is close to him. So it was nice and easy to get over there. We had our little car. My mom made him some fudge, whatever. I haven\u2019t seen my dad since whenever, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200312\">don\u2019t even know, Thanksgiving? And I barely talked to him. And I could barely talk to him since he got back from Jordan, the whole airport fiasco before Jordan where he asked me to drive him to the airport and the blind [ph?] one and whatever. And Tracy hasn\u2019t really been in touch either and so, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200313\">know. It was\u2026 the breakfast was awkward, and we were at IHOP. Michael was, I think, noticeably agitated just being around my father. We were trying to make it okay for Jesse. He has this tooth issue right\u2026 where he was younger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: Jesse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Mm-hm. And he fell and broke his tooth or something. So he had a crown on it for a while. I guess the crown fell out or his tooth moved a little bit because he\u2019s getting older now. And so I guess they are\u2026 their plan, from what I can understand, it\u2019s brown and yellow and half the size of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">other tooth because of course it\u2019s a shaved down\u2026 it\u2019s what you put a crown on; it\u2019s not a tooth. [13:04] And I guess their plan is to\u2026 the dentist said that he can get an implant in four or five years, and until then their plan is to leave it that way. And I noticed it and I said what\u2019s going on with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200352\">your tooth. And then\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass him but then I guess he was kind of embarrassed. But then I was asking him to the side, do you\u2026 does it bother you? I mean how long until you get the implant. He\u2019s like I don\u2019t know, four or five years. And I was like would you prefer that your mouth... <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200353\">that your teeth look even during high school? He\u2019s going to high school next year. And he was like yeah. I was like have you told your parents this? And he\u2019s like I don\u2019t know, I guess not. And so now this is\u2026 I have to address it. I don\u2019t know what the fuck is wrong with these people. It\u2019s not a money <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200354\">issue. I mean it\u2019s a weird why bother if he doesn\u2019t need it thing. Just because he\u2019s not voicing to you you\u2019re going to allow him to maybe be embarrassed about his smile during high school, his most formative years, hopefully, because he\u2019s still really awkward as a 14 year old. I\u2019m very upset about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200355\">it, and I don\u2019t exactly know what to do about it because I\u2019m trying not to\u2026 I\u2019m trying to stay out of that whole thing. But to the same extent I think that they\u2019re sick in the head for\u2026 I mean it\u2019s one thing to allow him to walk around with pants that are too short for him and clothes that don\u2019t fit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200356\">him properly and shoes that are falling apart because they just, I don\u2019t know what, want to wait until last minute, but his face? When he\u2019s going to be trying to meet girls and get girlfriends for the first time, hopefully. I just am horrified that it\u2019s okay with them. And my father was very strange. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200357\">I don\u2019t know if\u2026 my mom and I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s just like early Alzheimer\u2019s or just in his older age he\u2019s just getting more and more aloof to anybody else\u2019s anything, but he just kept talking about his Jordan trip as if there was that much to tell and as if we cared, quite frankly. [15:13] And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200358\">every time the subject would change it was as if nobody else said anything and he would just\u2026 what else? Oh, well we went to this museum. It was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562126\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20037\">THERAPIST: Like he was totally in his own head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. And Tracy, I just\u2026 I feel bad but I just\u2026 I didn\u2019t even want to see or talk to them. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s not pleasant to be around them at all. And all he did was talk about himself and them, and let\u2019s see, well nothing else big coming up. And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200391\">kind of like (sound affect) and he said well of course, your birthday. But my snorting wasn\u2019t at him not acknowledging my birthday, it was just more like not even like what does everybody else have going on. What\u2019s new with everybody else. There was hardly even any of that. He didn\u2019t ask me, really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200392\">not like I really care to talk about work, but he didn\u2019t ask me\u2026 he asked me about work. He didn\u2019t really ask me about how the living situation\u2019s going. What did I do for New Year\u2019s. [16:53] Nothing. And neither did Tracy. And she was just in a huge rush to get the hell out of there. I\u2019m like what the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200393\">fuck was even the point of doing this then? And I feel really bad for my brother. He has this fucking retarded elderly father that he\u2019s going to be more and more embarrassed of as time goes by and he gets more, either Alzheimer-y or in\u2026 just in his own world. His mother can\u2019t hear and refuses to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200394\">a cell phone and somehow treats him like he\u2019s four still\/is okay with her son having a really fucked up smile, which is so weird. So weird to me. (pause) I mean he\u2019s already a little Aspergers-y, just because some super smart kids are naturally kind of really awkward and have a little bit of that. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200395\">it\u2019s like add to it by having him look like a complete dweeb\/fucked up teeth. Oh, and apparently\u2026 oh, and my brother gave him a little razor, just\u2026 not an all fancy one, just a razor, the Schick, whatever, Gillette. And we kind of asked him and he was like yeah, they won\u2019t let me. Dad won\u2019t let me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200396\">And I was like but you want to? Because he has a little\u2026 and a little\u2026 couple, two hairs, and he could do a little bit here. And he\u2019s like Dad won\u2019t let me. And I go well do you want to? Do you feel like you\u2019d like that gone, that you don\u2019t want that? And he\u2019s like yeah. I\u2019m like Dad, what the fuck, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200397\">dude. Let him shave it. Yeah, it\u2019s going to grow back thicker but he\u2019s fucking 14. It\u2019s going to happen anyway eventually. If he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with this type\u2026 little mustache then let him fucking shave it off. Geez, why don\u2019t we send him to the fucking waxer if you\u2019re going to just tiptoe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200398\">around it. [19:14] And then Michael said to Tracy and Dad, make sure they... this is his. He can do whatever he wants with this, holding up the razor. Jesse\u2019s really lucky he has us. Because he doesn\u2019t voice\u2026 he doesn\u2019t tell them stuff. In Dublin is when I noticed his sneakers. I was like Jesse, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200399\">can\u2019t wear those sneakers anymore. They smell like poop. Your feet smell like poop, like dog shit. You can\u2019t. He\u2019s like well I don\u2019t know. She says I\u2019m not ready for new ones yet. I\u2019m like what? I don\u2019t know, it was not pleasant seeing them, and I thought it would be maybe a little better. Maybe he <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003910\">would\u2026 maybe they would be a little bit more\u2026 less selfish, recognizing that we haven\u2019t really seen each other in a while, whatever. But really it just got worse it looks like. He just got more self-involved because he probably\u2026 well they don\u2019t care anyway. I may as well just do whatever I want or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003911\">I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s really messed up, though, I think, because\u2026 I wish there was a better relationship. And I\u2019m not really sure because I\u2019m fucking feeling guilty but at the same time justified. [20:49] I\u2019m even fine with incurring much more debt because I\u2019m not asking my father for any money. I\u2019d rather <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003912\">have more debt than have to worry about dealing with him at all anymore, which is why I\u2019m particularly worried about this Helen situation because if she does leave I will have to ask him to help me supplement rent for a little while because I do not want to be kicked out of that apartment. And that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003913\">it\u2019ll take a little while to find somebody decent. But anyway, I mean overall it was a pretty good weekend. I just\u2026 see my dad and Tracy definitely kind of put a damper on it. I mean I recouped, I went home. And I had felt that I had earned my Sunday because of all the exercising and cleaning I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003914\">done on Saturday, and so I really enjoyed kind of just laying on the couch for a while, especially because I was going to babysit later in the evening, which was nice, also, because Livia\u2019s really cute. [21:53] But I don\u2019t know, just between poor return on the guys that are messaging me on match\u2026 at <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003915\">first it was oh, good, lots of new guys are popping up. But that\u2026 nothing really. And then Helen and my father. It just leaves me with a lot to think about still, I guess. And I keep going back and forth on having moments of feeling really liberated and fine about being single and just being able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003916\">date people and choose people, whatever, and then feeling just really distraught and like I just don\u2019t want to deal with it at all and just want to have somebody to hang out with. So I\u2019m never really sure which feeling to trust. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562126\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well each of the incidents you mentioned is kind of about\u2026 I think for you it\u2019s something about remain [ph?] in a way, or this guy is basically not coming through for you. And with Jesse it seems very similar, about the way that your dad and his mom aren\u2019t coming through for him And it seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2003B1\">especially infuriating about that is\u2026 how powerless he is, and I guess clueless, too, about what\u2019s going on. [24:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2003D\">CLIENT: That he could tell his parents he doesn\u2019t want his tooth to look like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20041\">CLIENT: In other words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20043\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20045\">CLIENT: And my older brother, too. I mean I feel bad for him because he really\u2026 I mean he\u2019s in a situation because my father\u2019s paying for this place that he\u2019s in, lots of money. A lot of money. So he\u2019s stuck in, now, this kind of I hate my father but now I have to be nice to him thing. Still. And he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200451\">always had this issue but I think felt less inclined to owe my father. I don\u2019t know. I think it sucks for Michael. I mean\u2026 and I think it sucks for him that I don\u2019t ask anything of my father, that I\u2019m not that\u2026 I\u2019m totally independent of him right now, aside from the school payments, which he\u2019s taken <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200452\">on and has never asked\u2026 that\u2019s not ever been an issue. And I mean I feel good about it in the sense that I don\u2019t feel indebted to him, even though I\u2019m indebted to many other people. Well and him, but I\u2019m not ready to pay him back. [25:21] But at the same time I feel like it\u2019s bad for Michael because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200453\">I wonder if he thinks because I\u2019m kind of at a point where I feel like I\u2019ve washed my hands of the whole thing. I don\u2019t owe you anything. I don\u2019t have to go do you any favors. I don\u2019t have to go help you change your storage space organization. And I think Michael feels like he still does. So I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200454\">a little bit guilty in kind of taking advantage of the fact that I don\u2019t really have to anymore because then Michael is going to have to maybe pick up the slack or, I don\u2019t know. But every time I see my Dad he just looks older and just sounds more insane. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. And I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200455\">Tracy is starting to pull away in the sense that she\u2019ll probably never get a divorce from him but I think she\u2019s just kind of like I\u2019m not going to e-mail anybody or communicate with anybody; I\u2019m just going to let him and these kids battle it out, basically, and Patrice, my mom. I think she\u2019s just totally\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200456\">I mean her most pressing e-mail to me in the last three months has been my new address so she can update her fucking Rolodex. Jesus Christ. She e-mailed me twice. By the way can you send me your e-mail address. I mean can you send me your new address because my Rolodex. I\u2019m like fucking Rolodex. Tracy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200457\">what the hell are you doing. I just don\u2019t understand them. And my mom doesn\u2019t either. [27:02] And I feel really bad for Jesse; these are his parents. At least I always had my mom to kind of be the cool one and voice of reason and kind of even out the fact that my dad was a painfully pretentious nerd <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200458\">and really embarrassing and whatever. And my mom made up for it because she was cool. She was the primary one that raised us anyway after he\u2026 after they divorced. But Jesse doesn\u2019t have that. He doesn\u2019t have anyone now. I guess I feel like there\u2019s something that I should or could do or, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200459\">Maybe it\u2019s just wishing that there weren\u2019t damaged relationships in my family or that it wasn\u2019t dysfunctional in any way or\u2026 I think about people like girls, men or women or whatever, who have really high esteem for their father, thinking he\u2019s such a great guy and love their daddy or whatever. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004510\">can\u2019t help but feeling jealous at the same time, angry that we don\u2019t have that, and a little bit blame my mom for divorcing him. And it\u2019s just all wrapped up in, I don\u2019t know, or feeling embarrassed about my feeling like what if I meet somebody with a normal family [28:59] Or parents who like each other <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004511\">or who are divorced and like each other, or a dad that you actually have any ounce of respect for. I have very little respect for this man, and it\u2019s a huge issue for me. I wish I had more respect for him. I have a lot of respect for my mom. But my dad, eh, a little bit, only.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562126\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20047\">THERAPIST: I think there are probably moments I feel to you, in a way, a little like your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20049\">CLIENT: In what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well probably not in a lot of ways but what I had in mind is I think you\u2019re often wondering, you\u2019re like how am I going to help you, what am I going to do, what have I done, what am I doing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2004D\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, we\u2019ve talked about that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but I mean in a way that\u2019s kind of like how am I going to be there for you. And if I\u2019m not, as he has not or he is not and hasn\u2019t been, then I\u2019m kind of out of touch with what you need or sort of looking at things in a kind of different, and sort of distant way, and probably in my own <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2004F1\">head, thinking about whatever theories I might be thinking about or a strange angle on what you said I may have in mind. [30:34] And so I can only imagine that I\u2019m thinking about sort of through much of what you said today, [inaudible] have in mind at the moment talking to me is kind of irritating, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2004F2\">frustrating, disappointing in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit, I think, but that\u2019s very different than the way that I feel like my father disappoints me. Because I mean I feel like with him there\u2019s no recouping at this point. He\u2019s consistently not paying attention to what I\u2019m actually\u2026 what I actually like, what I\u2019m into, what I like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200511\">to do, what\u2019s important to me, what my issues are. He\u2019s to the point that there\u2019s literally\u2026 I don\u2019t even have\u2026 there\u2019s no more energy I have left to even try to\u2026 I mean case in point, they brought us little fucking stupid gifts from Jordan. I don\u2019t really care if I got anything. And Tracy gives me <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200512\">some little tchotchke blown glass fucking pitcher thing. Not even a pitcher, looks like a pitcher but it\u2019s just a fucking little artsy fartsy\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20053\">THERAPIST: Tchotchke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20055\">CLIENT: Tchotchke thing. I was like thanks. And they could\u2019ve gotten me nothing or anything but I don\u2019t know, that almost felt worse than a fucking toaster. I don\u2019t know, I would\u2019ve\u2026 what the fuck am I going to do with this little piece of shit tchotchke. Really, Tracy? I don\u2019t have a house, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200551\">have a display case. What are you thinking? Use your brain. And it\u2019s just\u2026 this has always been the case with them. They just don\u2019t\u2026 they just are like whatever. Oh, this is cute, I should get this. This is a cute gift. Don\u2019t get me a tchotchke. I think twice, two years in a row, she gave me a fanny <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200552\">pack. [33:17] I had to give it back. Dude, have you ever seen me ever wear a fanny pack? What would make you think I wear a fanny pack, not to mention some fucking Indian looking one. And this has always been the case. They could\u2019ve gotten me an evil necklace or\u2026 evil eye necklace or a hamsa or even <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200553\">the free string that the religious fanatics give out at the wailing wall, I would\u2019ve appreciated more than this little tchotchke that now I can\u2019t throw away and have nowhere to put and the cats are probably going to knock it down on the floor and then break and then eat\u2026 and this is just\u2026 that\u2019s just\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200554\">and the same way with my father and him inviting me to these things I have no interest in, or trying to force the New Yorker subscription on me or whatever. It\u2019s just there\u2019s no going back now. How many times and in how many different ways can I tell them things. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562126\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20057\">THERAPIST: All right, so let me have a [inaudible] The first is I\u2019m hearing a bit in your response about them giving you the tchotchke, (laugh) how it sometimes feels with some of the things that I say, like what I just said earlier about your dad, kind of, where the\u2026 I think there are probably other <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200571\">times where it feels like I say things that point towards something that feels worthwhile or helpful or gets us into something that feels important. But like what I said a few minutes ago. I feel like well okay, fine, kind of, maybe, but what the hell am I supposed to do with that. [35:58] And so I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200572\">don\u2019t exactly have an explanation of what to do with it but let me motivate a little bit more sort of how I\u2019m approaching things. It seems to me that what you\u2026 one of the things that you do want are the kinds of responses that you just tried getting from your mom and from Stephanie about this guy. Oh <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200573\">my God, that\u2019s ridiculous, you should cancel it, what the fuck is the matter with [inaudible] Somebody who validates your point of view on where you\u2019re coming from, agrees, and says it\u2019s fine to do whatever you want to do, which is reassuring. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But (pause) I mean that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200574\">great and I think it\u2019s important, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s, in a general way, how you can be most helpful. I mean the thing that set you off in the first place with that guy and made it more than just all right, clearly this isn\u2019t going to work based on the restaurants he chose, I\u2019m just going to call <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200575\">him and tell him no, or I\u2019m going to check in and see if that seems like a fair thing to do and I\u2019ll do it. I mean you were furious. [37:28] I think because he is\u2026 he was sort of like\u2026 sort of the every man for guys you could be dating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20059\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2005B\">THERAPIST: And\u2026 or the ambassador for the guys you could be dating. And he totally let you down and was totally out of kilter with where you were coming from and what you want, in a way very similar to your dad. And you had this very intense reaction. And my point isn\u2019t this bad\u2026 isn\u2019t that that\u2019s bad. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2005B1\">In this case, who cares. It\u2019s not\u2026 but it\u2019s certainly not any fun. I mean you were pleased that you actually recovered from it and were able to have a good evening, but you said at other times that could\u2019ve been it. And that\u2019s bad. I don\u2019t mean like pathological but I mean [inaudible] you because some <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2005B2\">guy you never met calls, says hey I want to go here, and it\u2019s off kilter. That shouldn\u2019t blow your evening. And so it seems to me that that points towards an issue worth working on, just this thing about disappointment and the feeling of men being out of kilter with you. [38:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562126\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that\u2019s hugely related to my father and hugely related to my choices that I make now.

And, I don\u2019t know, do any number of things about, yeah, learn more about [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2005F1\">and see what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t\u2026 so that\u2019s kind of why I mentioned it. But it\u2019s sort of strange to me that your mentioning it also feels\u2026 felt, earlier today, kind of out of touch. Where the hell are you coming from? What kind of a tchotchke is that. [inaudible] remember what you said about.
