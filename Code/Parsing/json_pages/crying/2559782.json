Yeah, I'm not sure I much want to think about that. Let's see. I don't need to go into work for a couple of hours. So I might go home and make pancakes with James. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Sorry I got you out of bed early on your birthday. I didn't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: It's really okay. I got up at the same time I would have anyway. I just spent less time staring into space before I came over here. [0:01:00] Staring into space time is very important. (inaudible at 0:01:08). (Pause) Yeah, I don't know what to talk about today. I usually say that in hopes that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">it will prompt me to talk about something. But sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. (Pause) I really need a bag that's not from (inaudible at 0:01:56) conference. [0:02:01] I just need to get a new tote bag. I got rid of the other one (inaudible 0:02:08) I didn't want that (chuckling). (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">It hasn't been my first (inaudible at 0:02:32). (Pause) [0:03:00] Having four days off every week, I sort of thought I would get things done. But that was very foolish of me. I still kind of struggle to run errands I need to run and do things I need to do. [0:04:04] I still haven't gotten my haircut, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">for example. For three weeks I've been like, I'll go get my hair cut this weekend. Anyway, I think this weekend I did everything I really had to do, most of which was fill my prescription. But I let a couple of days go by. I had a couple days' gap between running out and filling it. So I probably should <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">care. I really don't care (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I think James cares. [0:05:00] But I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: James cares?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: As in, I think James got irritated with me when I was like, I have... I let it lapse and missed a couple of days. (inaudible at 0:05:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh, it's just Synthroid. So it's not a big deal in that my overall thyroid levels will go down. But I think it takes a while to get out of your body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I feel like James spends a lot of time having to take care of me in fairly basic ways and now can't get out of the habit. [0:06:09] And that's starting to bug me (ph) a lot. (Pause) And I don't think he's very happy about that either. I don't think he wants to feel like he has to take care of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">me, but I think he does feel like that. (Pause) [0:07:00] I just don't want to be complaining about it all the time. I just don't like that. But I'm really feeling like I complaining about it all the time (inaudible at 0:07:34). It's funny. I really just block it out, but it drives James nuts. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">the ambient noise is one of the things about living here. And I didn't notice that until I realized that I couldn't quite hear what I was saying (chuckling). [0:07:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh (chuckling). (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I got an e-mail back from Kirsten, my former roommate Kirsten. Did I tell you that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I don't think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Okay. Well, I e-mailed her, and she (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Then she wrote back and was like, yeah, that's great. Maybe some time in July. She's studying for comps right now.

So, anyway... (Pause) It's harder to say, I need to find a community in this city, where I'm living, when I don't know how long I'll be here. So there's a class at church that I'd like to sign up for. But I haven't because it's a three year commitment. So even if we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">going to be here for a year or two, if I knew we were going to be here for a postdoc, then I would probably sign up and say, nobody knows what's happening in three years, so whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Right. [0:10:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: But... (Pause) Yeah, I mean, I'm so terrified by the idea of having to find another psychologist. It's like I... (Pause) [0:11:01] When I sit down and think about it, I say, oh, of course. It would be bad, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. I would survive this, that would be fine. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I'm just scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause) [0:12:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: We...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Apparently we went to the mountains last year or maybe the year before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it was last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, it's gone. Completely gone. I forgot that we took the trip. And then I remember now taking the trip. But I look back at all the pictures that I took, and I don't remember anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It's a little strange seeing yourself in pictures and not remembering the context of the pictures (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Sure, yeah. (Pause) [0:13:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: One other thing that's really hard for me right now... and I'm not sure how much of it is the ECT and how much of it is just the forgetting that happens when you don't do something for a while, but feeling like I've lost most of my biblical studies background. [0:13:59] I don't remember the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">things that I did in grad school. I remember William &amp; Mary pretty well, but I don't remember what I learned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: You sound (pause) to me (pause) angry or kind of bitter about all these things that have been taken away, I think, or could be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: But I imagine if that's true that's not a very comfortable thing to begin with (chuckling).

I mean, I guess even starting with what you said about James, I think what he's taking away in looking after you is your sort of... part of the way you cope with feeling bad, which is to not notice things you could do to take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And you tune it out, like the noise. And he waves his arms about it or points it out. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I hadn't thought about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: And I think it can... and that's what's... maybe he's kind of interfering with the way you're trying to deal. [0:15:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think tuning out the noise is maybe... fits pretty well as a kind of... sense of that or metaphor for that. And [it's interesting that way] (ph). And he wants to move, and there's worry over that. And then there's memory, things that you invested in and that meant something to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">you, like a trip or all those years you spent studying stuff. (Pause) [0:16:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I think it's people taking things away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Hmm. (Pause) It's really hard to bear in mind that [if I'm forgetting] (ph) things it's probably not my fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Whether it's... (Pause) [0:17:57] Whether it's just you shouldn't forget things (inaudible at 0:18:01), or you should... thinking I shouldn't have left my program, or I shouldn't have taken so much time away from thinking about the stuff that I left (ph). I don't know. I wasn't feeling angry. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">I wasn't aware of feeling angry.

[0:18:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: [What I said was] (ph) (pause), I picture it either way, because to me what you did was to say, well, I feel like it's my fault, with the remembering. It's not that somebody took it away. It's that I feel like I've screwed up because I feel like I should be able to remember that stuff. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">one way or another it's my own damn fault I can't. (Pause) And... (Pause) [0:19:59] I'm not sure. On the one hand I think we could open (ph) and that could be a way you'd respond to feeling angry at something or someone else. It could be other things, too. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (Pause) I hadn't considered that... what you said, that I cope with feeling bad by ignoring or letting go of things that I could do to take care of myself. I hadn't thought about it that way. [0:20:56] (Pause) Hmm. (Pause) It feels more like... it feels like there's a struggle between <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">saying, if I don't take care of myself perfectly, then if I feel bad it's my own fault, and... represented in my head by James at this point, which is not good. [0:21:57] And that's impossible (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:23:00] I'm not sure what the difference is between losing things and having things be taken from you. (Pause) Right now I'm focusing a lot more... I'm framing it as losing things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: [I guess my thinking is] (ph), that, if things are taken away from me, then I have to get upset. I can't have that. I don't know. I feel like I'm not (inaudible at 0:23:54). [0:23:58] (Pause) Yeah, things aren't clear in my head, anyway. I don't know what I'm saying. (Pause) [0:24:56] It feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">like I worked very hard for a few months to find a job and find some stability. And now I sort of have that stability, whatever it is. I can kind of look around, and I say, oh, this isn't actually very good (chuckling). I don't actually want to be here like this. (Pause) And I can't tell how much of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F2\">that is things in my life that I would like to change and that can change, like having friends who live in Providence. That would be nice...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: And how much of it is just me not being happy. [0:26:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: As somewhat independent of circumstances like (inaudible at 0:26:08)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) If it's the circumstances, then I can just (exhaling)... it makes it easier to deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Even if I don't actually fix the circumstances, I can say, well, if you could do... if you did do these things, then that would fix it.

(Pause) But I feel like it's on me either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: I just don't know how to change it. (Pause) [0:28:00] Yeah. [0:28:57] I don't know. I'm feeling unhappy and really scared about something, and I'm not... or it's not entirely clear what it is. (Pause) And then I wonder, well, how much do I just look for things to be unhappy about, because that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">how I feel more comfortable? I don't know that either. (Pause) [0:30:00] [0:31:00] (inaudible at 0:31:46). I'm supposed to send that to Monica (sp?). I finally did send it to her yesterday. [0:31:57] But it took me a couple weeks, I think (chuckling).

[0:33:22] I think that may be the big thing that you're sort of worried about losing or having taken away. I think, as awful as things were a few months ago, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">felt often pretty much in contact with yourself, how you felt, what was actually going on with you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Where you were really at in a way that I think you rarely have in your life. [0:33:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And I think you may be sort of anxious in this new regime, the way things are now, with that being different and particularly if you moved. (Pause) And at the same time (pause) you're working pretty hard in many of the usual ways not to know or not to be in touch...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: With things you feel. Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Oh, just... and it's very strange to... it's like whenever I sit down and I'm not doing anything else or I'm just talking to you or at church or thinking about myself, I just get really sad. [0:35:12] And it's very scary because (pause), how sad will I get?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: (Teary) How bad will it get? But you're right. So it makes me feel like the rest of the time I'm not (pause) paying attention. [0:35:58] Or I'm not in touch with myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Then it's, how in touch with myself can I really afford to be? (Pause) Yeah, I think so. (Pause) When I really know what's going on, will I just kill myself (teary, chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:37:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well, then I wonder (pause) if that kind of feeling in touch with myself is... I wonder how real that is, because most of the time I don't feel good about it (chuckling). It's not... I don't remember very many times (pause) feeling really present with myself and having that be, I am so happy. [0:38:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Sure. That's usually...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Falling in love with James basically, stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. More recently it's generally been pretty horrendous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) And it's like (pause), do I draw out the horrendousness in order to...? Or do I encourage that in order to feel in touch with myself? [0:38:58] (Pause) And maybe to feel like it's okay to be... I want to say, close to myself, but I don't know if that's right, because (pause) I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">feel less guilty about it when I feel like I can't help it. [0:40:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: I mean, I feel like things are bad, and I can't help it. (Pause) It's pretty grim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I'm trying to figure out what you mean. When you are closer with yourself, you feel less guilty about things you can't do because it's kind of clear that you just can't do them or sort of...

Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm not sure if this is exactly what you are referring to. It reminds me a bit of when you go into the hospital, and it's at the point where, okay, somebody else is going to take care of me. And I've given up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:41:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And there was relief in that, probably partly from the guilt, at least for the time... sort of for the time being at that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:42:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, in a way I guess your sort of fear about being sort of more [in time] (ph) with what's been going on with you in a way is sort of fear that you really won't be able to contain it, that you'll either kill yourself or, because of how sort of painful and horrific it is, how sad, or how <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">guilty you feel about it, that either those feelings themselves or feelings that occur in reaction to them will be so strong that you'll kill yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:43:58] Unless I also want that to happen. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And you get... [I think there are certainly some points] (ph) where you're worried that the other people around, mostly James and me, won't be able to or won't want to help you with it or help you while you're with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Hmm. [0:44:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It'd be too much trouble for me. James would be really angry with that whole thing.
