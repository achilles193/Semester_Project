[Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh, you can always feel free to come in if the door is open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Oh, OK. OK. How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Good. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Nice to see you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Good to see you, as well. [Pauses] How are things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: [Chuckles] Oh, weird thing \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen you in two weeks. Things are all better, in general, I think. [Pauses] Was it last week? Our mediator sent us the documents, and I was trying to find a lawyer, and the one that I liked that was a $7,000 retainer, and I was like, \u201cOh, my God. I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">afford that.\u201d So, in the meantime, our mediator sent us the documents and, included in that document, she is like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve included the child support worksheet that we didn\u2019t have a chance to do.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So she basically was \u2013 it was like you said; it was like a formula, basically, based on the State of [chuckles] Connecticut, where she took: Rich\u2019s salary, my salary, what we mutually pay for Brady, so like the health insurance; and then deducted what he would pay for all of the school; and then came <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">up with an amount of $1,500 a month that he needs to give me every month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: And so she was like, \u201cAll right, look these over. Here is the stuff. So Rich would pay off all the credit debt if you didn\u2019t do alimony, if you choose to. So if you waive alimony, you\u2019ll be out of credit debt. Here is the child support. Rich will also pay for all the tuition and everything.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">And when I saw that, I was like, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d I was so relieved when I saw that, because I was like that is what makes \u2013 that is all I needed. Really, that \u2013 it is a lot more than I thought I would get. You know? And so she is like, \u201cLook this over. If everything is fine, just have your attorneys <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">look it over, and then we\u2019ll meet again and just make sure everything is fine, and sign it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And so he \u2013 so I didn\u2019t ask. I haven\u2019t talked to him directly about any of it, so he responded with just some other questions and some typo [ph] things, but then he is like, \u201cOverall, it looks good to me.\u201d So then \u2013 so then, today, I filled out my stuff and then just was like, \u201cOK.\u201d And, right before <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">I got here, I just wrote, \u201cJust to clarify, this is all the stuff that is \u2013 we\u2019re agreeing to,\u201d and then I\u2019m waiting to hear back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So it makes a huge dif \u2013 I am so \u2013 I was dancing at work when I saw it. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Because I didn\u2019t realize it was that \u2013 like you were saying, it was something that easy but \u2013 that it was something that easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: So he could come back today and be like, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t \u2013\u201d \u2013 I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m hoping, if that is it, then I\u2019m fine with what we have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Are you going to waive alimony?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Because I don\u2019t think he can give any more money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">I mean, looking at his numbers, we\u2019re almost pretty much equal. I mean, obviously, he has his parents who can give him more money, but [pauses] \u2013 for the amount that he is getting deducted and that I\u2019m getting, I think he\u2019ll probably be bringing home maybe $400 more a month than me. So I just don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">feel like there is more room for it. You know? And [pauses] I think $1500 seems like a lot to get on top of Brady\u2019s tuition. So I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562632\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Try to consult with an attorney [inaudible at 00:03:34]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">[Crosstalk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I \u2013 so \u2013 so, on top of that \u2013 on top of that, so, I e-mailed the mediator, because she is in a law office, and she had said, \u201cIf you need someone to look over your stuff, let me know.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: So I e-mailed her, also, and just was like, \u201cOh, do you have someone that can, maybe, review this with me and maybe not have such a high retainer, or maybe do an hour?\u201d Because I\u2019m pretty much \u2013 we\u2019re close to the end, maybe, so I don\u2019t need someone to give $5,000 to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: So she said she\u2019d let me \u2013 she was like, \u201cYeah, let me get you someone\u2019s information.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: So I feel like I\u2019m legally in a better \u2013 or like I\u2019m in a \u2013 at least that number came out, because I was like, \u201cHow do we even get a number? Is this going to be so dragged out?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: But, no, he understands he makes double what I make, so, hopefully \u2013 and if he pays all the credit card debt, that is fantastical. And, lately, I don\u2019t know what it is \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if it is because we\u2019re at this point where we\u2019re agreeing to things, [but] he has been \u2013 we\u2019ve both been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">\u2013 he has been very nice. He stopped talking to people. My friend Carla was like, \u201cRich hasn\u2019t said much of anything. He just told us you guys are in the middle of it, but he hasn\u2019t said much.\u201d So she is like, \u201cIt has been quite a change.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, we had a talk about it [chuckles] and, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">at mediation, I said something.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I think \u2013 I have a feeling \u2013 I, obviously, think he wants us to be cordial, but I think he doesn\u2019t want to upset me more so that I go after for \u2013 may probably go after more of his finances or something. So, in general, whenever we talk, it is like, \u201cHey, how are you?\u201d like jokey, like, \u201cWhat <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">is going on? Oh, yeah, do you mind doing this for me?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah, sure, tot \u2013\u201d \u2013 it has been very friendly and cordial, which has been nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Because you know that that is my always [ph] issue, is that he is mad at me. So he is still probably mad at me, but [chuckles] he is not showing it as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: So \u2013 so that has been better. So the past couple of weeks have been better, for sure, I think because I know the money thing is better. So that has kind of eased my mind. I\u2019m still kind of like I need the money sooner than later, because I\u2019m running out of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">And my friend Angela, who has been \u2013 and her divorce is getting finalized, too \u2013 she was kind of like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m surprised that you haven\u2019t gotten any money.\u201d She was like, \u201cYou\u2019ll get it retroactively, usually, but it is tough. How are you surviving without getting money from him?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBarely.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">You know? [Chuckles] But I know that it is coming, so I just need the check to come at some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: So that is good. And, overall, I\u2019ve been feeling \u2013 like, I came home the other day and I was like I really like my apartment. I\u2019m totally getting better about being alone at my place, and just\u2014or just doing \u2013 like, last night, I went and got my nails done because I\u2019m going on a business trip <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">this weekend, so \u2013 and I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll just go and grab a burrito, and I could \u2013 and I\u2019ll take it home.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, no, I\u2019ll just sit and eat by myself and read a magazine or something.\u201d It was totally fine and \u2013 so I\u2019m starting to get more fine with doing stuff by myself or just being at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">home by myself... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562632\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: \u2026And focusing on things that I like to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: And even when my son is asleep, it is like I\u2019ve been watching shows, or I\u2019ll call a friend, or read a book or something. So \u2013 and he is great. My son has been really wonderful, so he has been \u2013 so I\u2019m like \u2013 I keep saying \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it was I went to California, got some vitamin D or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">[Chuckles] The money is the huge thing; I think that was the big stressor. And Rich\u2019s attitude has seemed to turn a little bit, so [pauses] that has been very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Those are all good things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So now I\u2019m just kind of \u2013 I will \u2013 yeah, I will definitely have someone go over my stuff before I agree to things, but it seems like we\u2019re both kind of going towards a mutual agreement rather than a fight, because I just really didn\u2019t want that at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: That would have stressed me out a lot, constantly. But we\u2019ve talked about things. I told him how I wanted to sign up Brady for soccer, and if he obviously could attend it \u2013 we could attend any of them whenever, and he said, \u201cYeah, that sounds great. We could \u2013 just tell me how much it is, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">we\u2019ll split it,\u201d and so \u2013 or, I made payments to the credit card bills, and he is like, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll give you half,\u201d so he has been giving half for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: So that has been good, in general. And I\u2019m really \u2013 I know I\u2019m going on this month, but my apartment is getting there. I just had one or two more things to get, but it looks really nice, and [pauses] I like it a lot, actually. When I came home the other day, I was, \u201cI kind of like living here.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">It is good. [Chuckles] It is working. [Chuckles] I get to keep my dog, and I have a dog walker now. So I feel like I\u2019m getting a little more settled with things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: My friends have been really great. So I go to Denver this weekend for a conference, for work, to leave Friday, come back on Wednesday. And my friend \u2013 one of my oldest friends from San Diego is meet \u2013 is going to go out for the weekend and meet me, because she knows everything that has been <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">going on. She is like, \u201cI\u2019m coming out to see you and make sure you\u2019re OK.\u201d So everyone has been really, really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: So now I\u2019m just kind of hoping that the legal part of it gets resolved quickly so that we can go and file this thing. [Pauses] And that is it. It is not it but that is the big part of it. My friend, who is divorced \u2013 she has been at it for a year now; I don\u2019t want to do that. But her ex has <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">been a jerk. Rich is a jerk, too, so I was [inaudible at 00:10:00], hopefully.

But it is tough to know that I won\u2019t see him for a week or something. And I tend to feel like I\u2019m missing out on his life. I don\u2019t know \u2013 it is like they say, when you have kids, \u201cOh, it goes by so fast, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">you realize they\u2019re all grown up.\u201d And so it is like, well, that happens but now it is like half of that, like I have half of that time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">So that gets a little hard.

I let him stay up late sometimes so that we have more time together, but I know he is happy with Rich. But I can tell he misses me sometimes by \u2013 he is not sad; it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">is just kids and their moms \u2013 it is like a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: He never really wants to get off the phone that much when I call at night, but he will.

[Pauses] Yeah, I miss him a lot. [Pauses] But I imagine this gets easier somehow I don\u2019t know \u2013 when your kids are away, like in a divorce situation. [Pauses] Maybe not. [Chuckles] But he has been great. He is always so happy and stuff, [pauses] I just think it is hard not to be with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">him every day, especially because he is so \u2013 he is getting older and he is much more a little boy than a baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: And every time I see him, he just looks taller.

It is weird not to be with him. And I know Rich misses him a lot, too, when he doesn\u2019t have him.

I just want to sign the forms. [Chuckles] I think that, once I sign them, I\u2019ll be OK, and then I\u2019ll be all right. Not that I think that Rich will change anything, but I worry that something will change, like he changes his <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">mind about something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Paying for the \u2013 I mean, he kind of has to \u2013 the child support is kind of a thing he has to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: It is like a legal thing that he needs to pay for his kid. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">No, I don\u2019t know.

[Pauses] He has been good with Brady, and he has been very flexible with my travel and everything, so we \u2013 I called him, and we talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">about traveling. And, \u201cLiam, Peter [ph] and I are going to Virginia in two weeks, so can we swap our days?\u201d and he said, \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d I had a work event last week, and he picked him up and put him to bed in my apartment, for the sitter, and then the sitter came and took over.

They\u2019re his grandparents.\u201d So she is like, \u201cYou might as well have it at a party or something [chuckles] \u2013 a birthday party than at some serious event or something.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t have to worry about that right now. But now it is just more thinking about going home and talking to my mom. My mom is going to be a mess, but she has been a mess about it for a while. [Pauses] She\u2019ll probably just tell me that I\u2019m making a mistake, or am I, \u201cMarriage takes work.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">That is \u2013 \u201cThere are hard times.

Hearing from someone who \u2013 you\u2019re like, \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re telling me this?\u201d [Chuckles] But it is like \u2013 I think I\u2019ll just kind of explain and then, eventually, just be like, \u201cPlease stop bringing it up.\u201d I just don\u2019t want her harping on it for the seven <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201231\">days that I\u2019m there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: I know she won\u2019t. She\u2019ll probably be happy that my son \u2013 she\u2019ll definitely be happy that my son is there, so, hopefully \u2013 and like my brother Frank said, he was like, \u201cHe\u2019ll kind of take the focus off a little bit, because they\u2019ll want to hang out with him and spend time with him.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: Not necessarily feeling that they have to keep talking about this over and over again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: So [sighs] we\u2019ll [ph] be fine. [Pauses] It is also like presenting the \u2013 \u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d It is easier to say to people who have been divorced, because they\u2019re like, \u201cOh,\u201d and they get it; and the people who haven\u2019t are just like, [sympathetically] \u201cOoh.\u201d It is like \u2013 not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F1\">you feel like a little bit of a disappointment but a little bit like you\u2019re just, \u201cYeah, that kind of failed.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: Not that I\u2019m a failure but it was just like, \u201cYeah, I know.

It is so fast to get married but then it is so long to get divorced. What is that about? They make it so [chuckles] complicated. If you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C11\">to get married, you just up the street, to the city hall, and fill out a form.
