Yeah, I asked her if it would be okay for me to do that this weekend, several weeks in July (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right.

Just be like, I just didn't come back from therapy until much after you expected me to. No, I told them I might. (Pause) It's very hard to be around people all the time (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. And particularly going back to work tomorrow I don't feel like I've had the chance to rest, and so I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) [0:02:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not doing so well.

And I was serving as a lay Eucharistic minister, and there... it was... (Pause) They've been having contemplative services every other week in the evening and offering prays for healing or healing prayers at the... as well? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">one of the guys who's doing (inaudible at 0:02:53) didn't show up. [0:02:58] So, at the very last minute literally in the middle of the service...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: The priest was like, hey, can you do this? And so I did that. And I already was... I told him that I didn't want to sign up for that anymore because it made me too anxious. So he was like, you can say no, it's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: But I did, and it was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: You did do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: It was nice, but anxiety [creeps in] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: How come?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well, it's extemporaneous prayer...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Which I'm really not good at...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see. Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Or uncomfortable with. And people come up and they ask for prayers for the things that are... that they're going through that are really hard for them, and... [0:04:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see. You may have explained this to me once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: I think that... I think they started it during the ECT, because I know there was a training session that I went to. (Laughing) But I have no memory of what it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT: I only know that I went to it because it was in my schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">THERAPIST: Right. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">CLIENT: So it's important. (Pause) (inaudible at 0:04:43) I have been thinking a lot about what we've sort of been talking about on and off. [0:04:59] (Pause) I don't know if I can talk about this. It's just too (inaudible at 0:05:30). (Pause) [0:06:00] I got this idea that these horrible and sad parts <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200651\">of me are there. [0:06:55] And I both want to experience them and then really frightened of it, scared, too...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559786\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: And that that's... in some way if (ph) I don't experience that I feel like I lose touch with myself or I'm not myself. So I cry after sex a lot, a lot of the time (chuckling), which James is okay with. So that's good. [0:07:57] He's not freaked out by it (chuckling). He's sort of like, well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">that's how I know it was good for you (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Uh-huh. (Pause) It puts you in touch with yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) It's frightening to think that (pause), what if that's all there is when I'm in touch with myself? [0:09:01] It's just being sad. (Teary) What if that sadness is who I am? (Pause) Today, I'm just so sad, and I can't be sad with James's family (pause), and not because of them but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">just because they are people. [0:09:57] They are other people who are not me (chuckling). (Pause) [0:11:00] It is troubling and scary to me that sometimes I really welcome it. Sometimes it's a huge relief to be so sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: I don't know what to do with that. (Pause) And then that brings up the question of, what am I doing in here? [0:11:55] And what am I doing with my life? And how am I...? What would it even mean to be taking care of myself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: What do you mean about what you're doing here? Do you mean, if you're so sad and [sort of] (ph) getting in touch with it, then clearly you're not doing the right therapy or that sort of thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah, something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: I mean, just that (pause) I'll come home from therapy some days and clearly have been crying and be just real sad for a lot of the rest of the day. And James will say, rough session? I'll say, no, it was good (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Maybe... I don't know how much of this is James and how much of this is me putting this into James's eyes. [0:13:02] But I... (Pause) If... but... I don't know how to say it. I feel like it's concerning? (Pause) [0:14:00] And, if the point of therapy and taking care of myself and all this stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">I'm doing is to keep me out of the hospital and to get me well, I don't know what that looks like. (Teary) I don't think well means never really quite feeling like I am connected to myself. [0:15:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't want that. But it's hard not to feel like other people want that for me because they... it distresses them to see me in distress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:16:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: But then it's also not something I can control or put away when the time comes with... or reliably, so I... it scares me. (Pause) [0:17:00] (Teary) Right now I feel like it's about to get really bad, and I don't know whether I want that or don't want that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Are you referring to right now as in the next few minutes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:18:00] And I think, well, that's something that's just really wrong with me (pause) [in some way] (ph). [0:19:00] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I'm hearing you describing the wrong [inaudible at 0:19:12) you different places, like, in the expectations of people, people that you feel better, and my sort of... I don't know, being part of how you connect with things that [feel the worse] (ph), or (pause) sort of in your having all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B1\">awful feelings in the first place. [0:20:00] (Pause) [0:21:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559786\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: I don't know what to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And (pause) I guess I'm feeling (pause) sort of (chuckling) a bit trapped in a way that I think is related to how you're feeling quite trapped, I think, which is, on one side I'm inclined to say things about (pause) how actually most of the time... (Pause) [0:22:07] There are limits, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">or there is some containment on how often you're feeling... [you feel awful] (ph) the rest of the day...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: [Feeling that bad] (ph). Or maybe James sort of can't hear everything but can hear some things. Or in a way what you're saying today is, part of the story now is that [we care about our time] (ph) and your 28 square foot apartment. [0:23:09] I got the idea it was small (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: It's in Andover, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: [The whole under] (ph) 500.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Small in Andover is pretty small, so yeah. And these are four days you're not working, right? So even partly to just kind of be depressed and be upset in what I suspect is sort of an uneven, partly successful mixed sort of way, but a way that helps when James's parents aren't there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: So on one hand I'm inclined to sort of (pause) say, well, I think there are these sort of parameters, although you're saying, no, I feel like when I fall I'm just never going to hit the bottom, or... [0:24:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: If I'm walking on water, I'm just going to be drowned forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: It's like, I know there are these parameters. But in the past sometimes they've really... sometimes things kind of peter out over time. And sometimes it just picks up on itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it does. Let me just also say...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, the other side (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) the other hand was (chuckling). But then we should come back for you to (inaudible at 0:24:57) of course. [0:24:59] (Pause) What I was going to say... my concern, though, is then that you'll hear what I'm saying as a kind of reassurance that's sort of missing the point or telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB1\">you you're not supposed to feel as overwhelmed and as sort of lost as you do... [0:26:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: In other words, however sort of carefully couched, that I'm basically saying, well, you don't need to be feeling that bad or that hopeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: But what's interesting to me is that, before I said that, you responded by saying, well, hey (chuckling). Sometimes there are no parameters. It can't be contained... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Which... (Pause) [0:27:02] Which in a way sort of, I think, kind of anticipates or preempts what I was going to say in a way? But I guess the point is... (Pause) [0:27:58] (inaudible at 0:28:09) I'm inclined to say (pause), it's more... well, this is imagery (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: It's more complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: That's a good, safe... that's a safe thing to say (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Right.

(Pause) [0:28:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: But the point isn't to keep you out of the hospital.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: And... (Pause) Uh-huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: (Teary) That was me starting to cry, not me starting to have something to say (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: I feel like a lot of what I do to protect myself is just to say, well, if I don't really look at this too hard, maybe it will go away. [0:29:55] I feel like a lot of what you do is say, no, it's clearly there.

It's just too overwhelming emotionally, but I love music. I love it. (Pause) [0:31:00] (Crying) I don't know, I'm just not okay with thinking of myself as someone who... (Pause) I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D11\">like (pause), if I'm not very careful in how I manage myself or whatever, I'll fall into that. And most of the time it passes, but sometimes it doesn't. And then it gets horrible, and I can't understand or control it. And I don't know when that's going to happen. (Pause) [0:31:59] But I don't feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D12\">a real person if I don't feel that bad sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: (Crying) And that's a little... I don't like that. That (chuckling)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Well (ph), it's really quite disturbing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) (Crying, blowing nose) [0:33:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Well (pause), it has usually... (Pause) There's been a pretty clear sort of proximal trigger pursuant to your going to the hospital most of the time in the last nine months or so. [0:34:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Okay.

[so you're either in the hospital] (ph) or just getting a lot worse right then. But the first one in the fall was showing the apartment, I think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Do you remember, or do you...? This was after James moved here. And this was kind of on you, and you were determined this was something you were going to do. [0:34:55] And then [you discovered] (ph) you couldn't. Or there was another one, I think, after you came back from being with your <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E31\">family after Christmas...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And were hit by being away from them in a way you didn't expect or at least certainly didn't see coming. Or another one was when you were determined to get to work on job stuff. There was another one that happened pretty soon after Amanda left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And then there were...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:35:42)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: I just don't remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, those were all a few months prior to the ECT. [0:35:55] And then there were some around the time of the ECT, but they're probably harder to... harder to think out what caused them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Or I don't remember. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: [But still] (ph) it doesn't come out of nowhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: It has not (inaudible at 0:36:19). I think the one subsequent to those was... in a way seemed more to come out of nowhere. You could say that you were so on the edge from that period that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">THERAPIST: One of them, I didn't send you in, but you went in and saw somebody at Frederick who probably, I think, was probably a little more conservative than me and was like, no, you've got to be in. So stuff like that. [0:36:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but that was... otherwise there were... and obviously that's the trigger. That's not sort of the whole situation [of kind of impression] (ph) of how you were feeling, but there were things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (Pause) Which is helpful in some ways, but then in other ways... but I can't keep those triggers from happening (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559786\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: No, you can't. (Pause) But... (Pause) [0:38:00] But those are different situations. What you're worrying about now is feeling what you feel and getting so overwhelmed by it that you can't get out of it. And you need to go back to the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: And things get really awful again. And I'm not saying that couldn't happen. I'm just saying that's not what's happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I mean, to pick a more recent example, I think the most recent thing that was really scary in the way this early stuff is scary was when you called me recently when you were deciding whether to go to your friend's for the weekend or not. Not the time you did go, but the time you didn't. [0:38:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah. Family (ph), but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Sorry. Yeah. Right, it was Jason's graduation, so (inaudible at 0:39:04). So... sorry. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: No, that helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That was more the feel of what it was like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Rather than you just kind of feeling awful getting in touch with it and then getting totally lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Is that just how it's going to be? It's just... (Pause) If I look back closely at myself, somewhere I'll just feel awful? [0:40:02] Yeah, I can't answer that question. (Teary) But I... yeah, I worry that it's not like I am feeling this awful somewhere today and tomorrow, but that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D1\">that's just a state of being for me. It's just how I am. (Pause) My... (Pause) My impulse is to say to myself, there there. Of course not. No, no, no. [0:40:57] But that's not actually helpful at all (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: [What occurred to me] (ph) is there's not quite an answer to your question, although I will answer (ph) your question. But I think you've also been on a bit of a sort of bend away from how you've been feeling over the last four to six weeks or so, I guess? (Pause) I think with working three <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F1\">days a week and switching from five to three days in here-which really for three or four weeks there was two days-I think was a big change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: And it seems to me you're kind of coming around from that maybe a little bit now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. I really have been really invested in making that change work and being okay with it. [0:42:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: It's just really important to me to be okay with it. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I can't sort of shake the feeling of something here that I also can't explain very well (chuckling), which is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Pay back. Sorry. I know that feeling very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">THERAPIST: (Laughing) Uh-huh. [0:42:55] Which is... (Pause) I've said this a few times, but you probably don't remember when things were really awful a few months ago. But [in a sense] (ph) also part of one happens... I mean, you feel [it constantly] (ph), those things just getting awful after one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F1\">these triggers or (inaudible at 0:43:24) events. And then you're sort of getting really suicidal and needing to go to the hospital, kind of like that. But I think I also probably said something at the time about how it seemed to me as well there was a... some feeling of both defeating James and I, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F2\">really wanting to put yourself in somebody's hands to be taken care of at the hospital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.

And [the thought of mine] (ph), <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B1\">when I said, well, actually there's this kind of shape to it and blah blah blah.
