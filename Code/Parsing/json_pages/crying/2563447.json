I\u2019m well. You?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I\u2019m okay. I had a great weekend. But I don\u2019t know why now today I feel like ugh, like weird again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Weird, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Weird... Like I keep running into people I know. Like I was just driving to get parking here and I noticed one of the psychiatrists that works with us just like randomly walking by. And then this weekend I did some jogging and I ran into someone. I heard my name being called and it was someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">I work with, like at one of the other offices. And then I\u2019m like crossing the street and my executive director is like in her car, like not even noticing I\u2019m around, just driving through. And I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is a small town.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Like this would never happen in Jamaica. But then it brings up like concern of like, \u201cWow, I really have to watch my behavior.\u201d And, again, it brings up like anxiety, \u201cOh my gosh. I wonder who saw me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I started looking up... Like I was looking up funny YouTube videos or something. Then suddenly, one other one came up that I guess was related and it said, \u201cDrunk girl something,\u201d and then I started typing in other things like looking to see if someone posted a video of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Thank God like I didn\u2019t find anything. But you never know. Like with everybody having a cell phone. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Just something... Somebody... Who\u2019s watching?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I had a little incident, like (SIGH) some unhappy students because they were trying to get their roommate in because, \u201cWe\u2019re so worried about her. She has an eating disorder. She\u2019s running eighteen miles a day and eating a handful of popcorn every day.\u201d And they came in like two months <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">ago to see me. And I offered them... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Did you tell me about that situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Oh. I remember somebody, a group of students going into talk to you. But it was like a lot of intense... They were an intense group themselves. But this happens a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I had a couple, like... Okay. Yeah. At the beginning of the year, I had a group worried for someone because she tried to commit suicide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s... Yeah. That\u2019s what it was. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that one went fine. But this one it was just one roommate coming in saying, \u201cI\u2019m so worried about my roommate. What services do you guys offer?\u201d So I gave her all... \u201cThese are your options.\u201d About a month and a half goes by and finally her roommate contacted me via e-mail. \u201cGreat. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">I\u2019ll let you bypass the system.\u201d Like normally we have a triage system. Like a counselor will call you, ask for your basic info and then assign you to someone. I said, \u201cJust call the front desk. I\u2019m the one who notified them. They\u2019ll put you into my schedule.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">Because I\u2019m in between patients. Like, we\u2019re going to do a back and forth dance. \u201cSo let the front desk take care of you.\u201d She calls the front desk and even though I had made them aware of the situation, \u201cThis is the name of the student. It\u2019s okay to put them on my schedule,\u201d it\u2019s crazy. Like I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">have an opening for three weeks and everybody is in crisis. And they must have forgotten, you know, because she called and freaked out that they said, \u201cOh, you have to have a triage call.\u201d And she started crying on the phone, \u201cHow do you expect me to tell my problems to a perfect stranger?\u201d Yet that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">what she wanted to do with me. She had never met me. But anyways, the next thing you know, the roommate who had come to see me is writing me a long e-mail complaining about how disappointed she is in Counseling Services and, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s anything you\u2019re doing Dr. Barnes (ph). But, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200373\">you led me to believe that you would take care of my roommate.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Like I think she had this fantasy that as soon as they convinced their roommate to come, I would like swoop her up and just be like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: She didn\u2019t expect that like there might be a two week wait for an appointment. Unless her life is in danger... I mean, she can come in and see the person on call. But if she wants to see me, it\u2019s going to be a process. So this long e-mail... And I felt really sad. I was like... She wasn\u2019t hostile <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">towards me, more towards the system. And I have this mentality of like, \u201cThe customer is always right.\u201d And I want to make people really happy. I don\u2019t want to make people upset with me. And so I wrote her back like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m so sad you had this experience. It seems like our plan didn\u2019t work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">How about you contact the person on call right now? Let\u2019s get your needs met. Let\u2019s get your roommate\u2019s needs met.\u201d Anyways... She responded very... She called right away the person on call. It\u2019s funny because I mentioned this in a little meeting today and one of my colleagues who supervises me now, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">when I said, \u201cThe customer is always right so this is how I approached it,\u201d he was like, \u201cNo. The customer is not always right especially not in therapy.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I guess we just differ on that. Like I... Even though... Yeah. She... I\u2019m not going to... She definitely had this fantasy of me coming in and taking care of her roommate and everything. But I\u2019m not going to say that to her face. Like she\u2019s not in treatment with me. You know, I\u2019m going to be polite and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">that\u2019s just my way of being. And I guess he wouldn\u2019t have had a problem saying to her, be more direct like, \u201cWell, you misunderstood. That\u2019s not how we do things around here.\u201d Like that\u2019s his approach. But that\u2019s not me. So I think I\u2019m okay with doing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. And that kind of approach that he\u2019s... Was it a he that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: It was a he. He\u2019s kind of... We joke like about his hidden aggression. He\u2019s a little hostile underneath the surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. What is it about... And also what is... You know, it seems to me like you were maybe trying to understand where all this was coming from too. I mean, I think if you kind of go with, you know, the customer is always right, you\u2019re trying to look for what do they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">feel like they needed and why did they... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. They felt like they were let down and maybe they felt like I had misled them. Maybe I wasn\u2019t clear enough in saying, \u201cBy the way, when she gets here, it might not be immediate. It might take two weeks.\u201d In her e-mail, she\u2019s like, \u201cAnd she\u2019s practicing for the Providence Marathon and she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">only eating 300 calories a day.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s really concerning. Call the POC (ph) right now.\u201d Things smoothed over after she talked to the POC who got her roommate into see me. Like I\u2019m meeting with her this Friday or something. The roommate wrote me back, \u201cThank you so much for, you know, giving <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">my information to the POC. She was very helpful. My roommate has an appointment with you. I\u2019m sorry that there was such a miscommunication,\u201d whatever. She\u2019s happy supposedly. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">Then I get an e-mail from my boss saying, \u201cDid you see the latest article in the GWU (ph) newspaper?\u201d It was a student basically complaining about us, not naming any names but basically telling the story I just told you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: ...and how disappointed she is in the mental health system at GWU and how, you know, there should be like more clinicians or more money and it\u2019s ridiculous that I have somebody who\u2019s on death\u2019s door and she\u2019s not being taken care of. Mind you, this student has gone to health services for checkups. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">If she was on death\u2019s door... Like they weighed her, they did her blood pressure. It she was on death\u2019s door, they would have sent her to the ER.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: So... (PAUSE) Anyways, like... But when my boss said that... Like he came in very relaxed, kind of chuckling, \u201cDid you see this article? Tell me the details in case anyone asks me.\u201d You know, because he\u2019s the director. I\u2019m sure someone, the president or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: It was in like the student newspaper?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I\u2019m sure someone will ask him about it and he just needs to know the details. But I didn\u2019t feel threatened at all. Like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">But I have this anxiety that one day he\u2019s going to come in and be like, \u201cMelanie (ph), one of the students told me that they saw you, you know, drunk and disorderly out in public.\u201d Then I\u2019m building this and I\u2019m finding myself feeling like a huge fraud.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: What if they did? What if they saw you out? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I would be so ashamed and embarrassed. And like my friend Carly (ph) who works there part time, she tries to make me feel better because I talked to her about this. (LAUGHTER) And she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m sure that everyone there struggles with something. I mean, they\u2019re human. I can just picture so <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">and so like maybe their thing is gambling or maybe their thing is food or drinking. You know?\u201d Like she tries to make it like, \u201cMelanie, you\u2019re human. You make mistakes.\u201d But for me, I feel like the position I\u2019m in... I don\u2019t know. If I was a sales person or something, I don\u2019t think I would feel the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">shame I feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">Like I feel like I have to be a very ethical, put together, psychologically sound person to be a psychologist. And I am in the room. I haven\u2019t done anything unethical, anything I\u2019m not proud of in the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Gosh. What it makes me think of like, just to share this, you know, maybe randomly is that, you know, in some ways, it\u2019s so, such a kind of a... I was thinking about how you\u2019ve described this feeling before to me about what are people going to make of this side of myself that, you know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">I don\u2019t want people to know about and what if they were to know? How would they shift in the way that they think of me? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">You know, it seems to me like there\u2019s some roots here in what you\u2019ve been, what you\u2019ve told me about your family in some ways. In some ways, first of all, I think of kind of the danger it was to show another side of yourself to your family as well as to kind of, even with your mother I think... Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">not even with your mother. I think with your mother there\u2019s a way you feel like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to be the psychologist. If I\u2019m not the psychologist and she sees some other part of me, this is going to...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: This ship\u2019s going to sink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: The ship\u2019s going to sink. Something about you needing to be the kind of, the one that\u2019s kind of like, yes, steering the ship... What happens if you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s funny you say that. I have a lot more to say about my family that has been coming up. But I\u2019ll get to that in a minute. But, yeah. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s me putting pressure on myself or if that\u2019s the way they treat me. You know, my mom just called me on the phone now. She\u2019s dealing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">with some kind of family problem. She\u2019s like, \u201cMelanie, you\u2019re the psychologist. You tell me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: \u201cWhat should I say?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Well, it seems like when you describe it at least, there\u2019s this feeling, of course, it\u2019s coming from your mother that brings that in, that, you know, \u201cHey, I need you to be... I\u2019m looking for you to be the expert, for you to be the one that knows, the one that\u2019s kind of steady <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">in so many ways.\u201d And when you don\u2019t do that, you get these senses of disappointment. I also think though... You feel it too. You feel it too. You feel that there are consequences in how you feel if you mom (inaudible at 00:11:41) that\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019m not allowed to have my own demons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Anytime she gets even a whiff of that, she shuts down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It affects you. It really affects your...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: It makes me feel so broken. And... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(PAUSE) Yeah. (CRYING) And it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been so sheltered the past two weeks. Like I\u2019m... Well, last weekend was when I had the conference. Right? And then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: This past weekend... Because we\u2019re only two weekends out from that horrible weekend and this weekend, I stayed in on Friday and I rested and I\u2019ve been eating well and I went on Saturday and I ran. Like I found a new path, you know, because I live in Falmouth (ph) now. So I found a path and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">went all the way to the reservoir and I avoided eye contact at all costs because I didn\u2019t want to run into any of my clients. But not like they would recognize me anyways because I\u2019m so out of my element. But I just didn\u2019t want to... I guess I didn\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Yeah. What if they saw you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why that bothers me. I think I\u2019m... I haven\u2019t put a lot of thought into it. I just hear a lot of people say that. Like a lot of people I work with, they avoid going to a certain gym because a lot of students might go there. You know? But what if they saw you? (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Listen. I\u2019m not saying that, you know, saying that they\u2019re wrong to feel... But I\u2019m sort of wondering what is it about that to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe they won\u2019t... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s stupid. I was going to say, \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t see me like in the same role, like all knowing, like the doctor in the office.\u201d But they\u2019ve got to know I\u2019m human and I don\u2019t wear work clothes sometimes or...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: I wear sneakers and I go jogging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah, yeah. No I hear too on the thread of the story you told me about the, about these girls, the roommates wanting a kind of... And I think you\u2019re right. They must have wanted some kind of like real sense that, \u201cThere\u2019s somebody looking over us. They\u2019re not going to mess it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">up. They\u2019re going to get it.\u201d And then when you feel like somebody drops the ball, you feel like that image of you is downgraded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. (PAUSE) So I\u2019ve been trying to get into my old routine now that the weather is changing. And that made me feel good. So I worked out. And then I went that night to my friend Carly\u2019s house, Saturday night and we just had a night in with TV and conversation, like we used to before I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">met James (ph). And then Sunday, again, I woke up at a decent hour, ran errands, like things I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a long time, just checked them off my list, ran again, it was a beautiful day, cleaned my house, did laundry. But I feel like I\u2019m going to keep doing this as long as I can and I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">not had a drop of alcohol. But I feel like it\u2019s a matter of time before I screw up again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">And it always feels this way. Every time that I do something like I did on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, I feel like I\u2019m very good for a long time. Like give me a good six months that I\u2019m very careful. I probably won\u2019t have even like a glass of wine for another three weeks or so. I\u2019ll start slow and then... But <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">then I\u2019ll get more comfortable with it. And I\u2019ll start going out with friends again. Like I haven\u2019t even gone out to bars and stuff with friends like I used to. I just... I feel like hiding. I don\u2019t feel like, \u201cOh my gosh. What if I run into someone who recognizes me from that night? Or what if I lose <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">control again?\u201d But it\u2019s always this feeling like, \u201cBut it\u2019s only a matter of time before you screw up again.\u201d And I\u2019m so scared of that and I think, \u201cWhy did it have to be that way? I didn\u2019t want it to be that way.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">And like so much is on the line now. (CRYING) Like I have this fear that I\u2019m just going to like lose my whole career. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And the way you laid it out to yourself is almost like you\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019m being good. I\u2019m being good. But wait. I\u2019m going to be bad soon.\u201d It\u2019s really... That kind of way you\u2019re... A certain kind of self that you want to stay, that like I think has something to do with, \u201cWell, I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">feel good as long as I\u2019m acting good, as long as I\u2019m being good, acting and being good. I don\u2019t know what to do with these other aspects of myself.\u201d And... (PAUSE) But, you know, they\u2019ve got that kind of flavor of some part of you, some echo in you or something that\u2019s there. But you don\u2019t know... Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200972\">the two just have to be separate. The two... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s like that with everything. Like look at my romantic relationships. Look at us in here how I\u2019ve told you, \u201cI can\u2019t think of you as a human.\u201d (LAUGHTER) Like even when you come in, my mind wanders like, \u201cOh, maybe he had a break. Maybe he was taking a walk. Maybe he went to go get something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">to eat.\u201d But then like my mind goes quickly back to just you exist in this room.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What do you think it is? What... Something starts to happen when you start to think of me outside of the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just thinking now... Because I stop it when that starts to happen. Like, \u201cOh, okay. Don\u2019t want to think about that.\u201d It\u2019s not like it brings up anxiety. But I just avoid it. But I\u2019m just thinking about when I said earlier, when I came in and I said, \u201cThat psychiatrist walking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">around...\u201d Like maybe if I saw you walking around I would think, \u201cHoly shit. That means one night if I\u2019m out with friends and I\u2019m acting in a certain way or dressed in a certain way or drinking too much, like what might he think?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: What do you think I\u2019d think? What would I say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: You\u2019d just avoid because I know that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Like you might make eye contact and give me a nod or something. And then if I was at a bar, you\u2019d probably leave because that\u2019s what I would do. (PAUSE) But then you wouldn\u2019t... That\u2019s it. You wouldn\u2019t think anything else of it. (PAUSE) Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">like... I think I ran into a client once like at a hotel upstairs or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t even remember what her issue was, something about relationships and guys and she was surrounded by guys when I saw her. And I just... She didn\u2019t even see me. So I went downstairs and I left and I stayed down for the rest of the night. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">But like she wasn\u2019t even on my mind. You know? Like I just carried on. I guess it\u2019s like my narcissism thinking, \u201cOh my gosh. What are these people going to think of me,\u201d when probably they\u2019re just not even going to think twice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But you didn\u2019t think about it much. Is that what you were saying? Like after you had seen...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: After the client? When I saw the client?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: No. I just like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable.\u201d And I don\u2019t feel comfortable sitting here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if the issue was alcohol or what. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: But everything is very...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019ve never... Have you ever seen me anywhere out or in Amherst or any... (PAUSE) Down at the hospital or anything like that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: No. I used to see you when you were a supervisor there. But, again, that was like safe because it was like, \u201cOh, of course. He\u2019s a supervisor.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Oh okay. Okay. When I\u2019d be at the hospital. Yeah. That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: I mean, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. I\u2019m just very neurotic and I\u2019m putting too much thought into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: No, no, no. It\u2019s something that you\u2019re... It maybe would mean something different if it was in a kind of, you know, an environment outside of something that feels clinical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: You know, a hospital or a, or this room. Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. Some... It\u2019s almost like what am I like outside? I was thinking some way the curiosity about what I\u2019m like outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t... I mean, yeah. There\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Or (inaudible at 00:20:55) not wanting to think about it so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s a natural curiosity, I guess. But I stop that train. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. We live in a really small community. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Like I... (SIGH) It\u2019s just ridiculous how small it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Well, what do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Like... (LAUGHTER) So my friend Carly... (LAUGHTER) She\u2019s a part of like an analytic training, like a fellowship, and internship, one of those. So she was like, \u201cOh join us. Come with me to one of these things that you can get continuing education.\u201d (LAUGHTER) And she (inaudible) she was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB1\">\u201cOoh, Royce (ph) is on here.\u201d And so she read me the little snippet. But it\u2019s so funny how careful she is. She\u2019s like, \u201cAre you sure you want to hear what he\u2019s presenting on? Are you sure? Is it okay?\u201d And it was something about money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: And I was like thinking, \u201cYeah. He would do a really good job.\u201d Because I was just thinking about like how it\u2019s come up in here and how money has so much meaning for me and my story. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: (inaudible) I was like, \u201cYeah, that makes sense. Yeah. He\u2019s probably do a good job.\u201d But that was it. But then again...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: That was it for... What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Well, like I didn\u2019t put more thought into like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: But yes. The other thing that came up was... I said, \u201cOh, that would be actually interesting because I\u2019m thinking about like private practice.\u201d But I\u2019d be like, \u201cNo way I could show up to that. How weird would that be?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Why? What would you think? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: It would just be a weird... Even though like I remember I spoke to you on the phone or something or e-mail. No, in here. I said like, \u201cOh, I put you down as a reference for our referral list.\u201d (PAUSE) And I think you asked me like, \u201cWell, would that feel weird or...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">I think I agreed that I wouldn\u2019t refer my people to you. But like I had someone, for example, one of the post docs come in, \u201cOh, I\u2019m looking for a male in Amherst. Do you recommend Brent Royce (ph)?\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s the one I put on the list and let me tell you about his style or whatever.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">Because I don\u2019t know. I think the lines would get blurred if I were to refer to someone to you and I had to consult with you on the phone, like if they signed a release and they wanted you to talk to me. That would feel weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What do you think... What... Yeah. I remember you saying that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: But it shouldn\u2019t because you know I\u2019m a psychologist and it\u2019s like we could put... But it is very black and white. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">Like you\u2019re putting that part of me aside and you\u2019re just seeing me momentarily as Melanie the professional.

But some people do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: Right. Like if in the future I have a client who happens to be in the mental health field and they refer someone to me, that\u2019s okay to do, like consult with them on the phone even though they\u2019re a patient?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean... I think it depends on what you\u2019re comfortable with. But I think... Again, it\u2019s a personal thing. To me, maybe an... You know, I think for me maybe it\u2019s... I\u2019m a little bit... I can be a little bit insensitive about it because I think people do feel uncomfortable about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">CLIENT: I would feel like I\u2019m faking it with you. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: I mean, and I could. I totally could kind of like when I saw you at graduation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Oh right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">CLIENT: Because you were seeing me as an intern. You know? I mean, nobody there had to know. Except for my mom, nobody knew that I was in treatment with you. (PAUSE) Yeah. So I\u2019m not sure how I feel. But I\u2019ve decided that I won\u2019t refer to you. But it seems like other people are and I\u2019ve said wonderful things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: Oh good. Well, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">CLIENT: It\u2019s funny that you brought up like my family. I\u2019ve had a lot of family stuff going on. My mom\u2019s brother came to visit his daughter who is the cousin... This is complicated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">The cousin that has the twin boys that he\u2019s like one of my best friends and it seems like the criminal brother... Remember the one that was in hiding? His son was in hiding. And they moved to Florida.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: So criminal side of the family... It seems like they all got together at my cousin\u2019s house. She has a really big house on the water. And had like a giant barbeque, get together... Like everyone was there even people from Jamaica, like my cousins and stuff drove down. My mom wasn\u2019t invited. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">she... She was so hurt. She was crying all weekend. And I was trying to very gently point out to her like, yes, it\u2019s the principle. That\u2019s messed up. \u201cThey should have at least asked you. But keep in mind, a month ago when you knew my uncle was coming, you were having nightmares and you were feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B2\">extremely anxious because you were afraid he would invite you over and you didn\u2019t want to see the criminal side of the family.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Like she doesn\u2019t like them. She doesn\u2019t want to be any part of that. She loves her brother, the one that\u2019s visiting, but they come as a package. And she doesn\u2019t want to see all those people. And she was like, \u201cOh, if only I could just... I just don\u2019t want them to call.\u201d And then he doesn\u2019t call <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">and she\u2019s broken and in tears. (PAUSE) So I had to kind of help her out with that this weekend. And there\u2019s like such a sense of, \u201cWe\u2019re better than you.\u201d Like my little sister Carly (ph), she\u2019s going to be 21 soon. And I guess she saw my mom crying this weekend and so she asked her what\u2019s wrong. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F2\">my mom kind of, you know, told her what was going on. And Carly, she has like the mentality of a twelve year old. She\u2019s not very like emotionally intelligent. Or I don\u2019t know what it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">But she\u2019s like a sponge with my mom and Billy (ph). She takes in whatever she kind of gets from them. And she\u2019s on the phone with me. She\u2019s like, \u201cDid you hear how mom is so upset about how they didn\u2019t invite her? Those people. They\u2019re garbage and we\u2019re so much better than them. Aren\u2019t we? Like you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201211\">a doctor.\u201d And I was like... And what else was she saying? \u201cAnd they get together and I didn\u2019t know this. But did you know that our uncle smoke marijuana with them? Like they sit there and they get drunk and they smoke marijuana.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like to judge. I know I do at times. But whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201212\">That\u2019s their thing. It\u2019s not our thing. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and be like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re so much better or educated and all them have like high school degrees and smoke pot and take...\u2019\u201c They\u2019re covered in tats and like taking pictures like flipping the bird. Like just... I\u2019ve said it in here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201213\">I\u2019ve been judgmental. I\u2019ve called them the Jerry Springer crew. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">But it\u2019s like... I don\u2019t know. I feel like I don\u2019t belong anywhere. I don\u2019t belong with them. But I don\u2019t want to judge them. And I don\u2019t belong with my mom and Carly and Billy who are like with their noses up in the air, like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re so much better.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: My mom... This weekend, she worried me because she was stressed about that and Billy recently turned like 56. And I asked, \u201cHow does he feel about turning 56? How is it going on the job search?\u201d Because I hadn\u2019t asked her in a while. She was like, \u201cWell, you know, same. He goes to job interviews. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201271\">But, you know, no one calls him back.\u201d And then she said something like, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re just going to have to move out of here to a place where no one knows us so he can just get whatever he can like set, like delivering pizzas or something.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">And I was like, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that in order to get a job like below his...\u201d (PAUSE) How do I say it? Like below what he\u2019s capable of or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. His... Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">CLIENT: His station, below his station. \u201cYou\u2019d have to move to a place where nobody knew you?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cYes. Don\u2019t you know how many people we know here?\u201d And I was like, \u201cIs that what he\u2019s thinking of doing? Like getting a job like that?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, something. Manager <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D1\">at a store or something, you know, anything because this is getting ridiculous and it\u2019s taking a long time and I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. We haven\u2019t even filed taxes because who knows how much we\u2019ll owe this year.\u201d And she\u2019s exhausted because they gave her this full time position until the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D2\">end of May. And I feel bad for her because her job is so physical. She\u2019s chasing around two year olds all day, carrying them, up, down, up, down, chasing them around. It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s 80 degrees out there. They\u2019re at the playground. They\u2019re swimming, all this stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">And she gets up at five, has to be at work by like seven. And I think those days she comes back and like four. But other days it\u2019s like nine to six. And, I mean, it\u2019s physical all day and she\u2019s exhausted and she said to Billy, \u201cWell, I was really hoping to have the summer off or maybe part time.\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F1\">he was like, \u201cWell, you know, because the checks are really good. Like they\u2019re really... They\u2019re helping a little.\u201d So now I feel like angry at him that she\u2019s working so hard. Like it\u2019s like the queen has been dethroned. Like she had such a different life. And it\u2019s almost like pity. I just feel so badly <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F2\">for her. Like she compares herself kind of to a maid without saying it. Like she says, \u201cI clean shit all day. And my hands smell like Lysol from bleaching the toys and disinfecting. And I come home sweating and I\u2019m sore.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2012E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">And meanwhile, he is dicking around. You don\u2019t know how many times he\u2019s texted me, \u201cMelanie, I need you to get me a police report from your missing wallet and phone.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy? Why do you need a police report?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, because I paid for your cell phone.\u201d The one he got me, he paid <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201311\">80 bucks for it. Did I tell you? He somehow finagled a brand new phone that I\u2019m going to get for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">CLIENT: Okay. So problem solved. He\u2019s going to get it replaced for free. But he\u2019s so desperate that he filed a claim with Discover card which is the card he used to pay for the phone...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">CLIENT: ...the 80 bucks and they said, \u201cIf you show a police report, we can reimburse you the 80 bucks.\u201d So he\u2019s on my case every day for just another 80 bucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:33:57) I see.

She called me the other day crying in a car. She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m on my way to my friend\u2019s house.\u201d And it was a Thursday night at like ten. And she\u2019s like, \u201cI tried to leave the house because my friend was like, \u2018Hey, come over. Let\u2019s watch a movie,\u2019 because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D1\">we both don\u2019t have school on Friday.\u201d And Billy comes into her room, \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to a friend\u2019s. She lives like down the street.\u201d It\u2019s a friend that they\u2019re familiar with. And he\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s a school night. You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Mind you, she\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D2\">to turn 21 in like a month. And she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t have school tomorrow. I don\u2019t have classes on Friday.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYou need to figure out what you\u2019re going to do with your life. We\u2019re going to send you to Providence this summer to be with your sister and there\u2019s some acting classes at Yale I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D3\">you to take.\u201d And she\u2019s just like storming out of the house, like, \u201cAlright Dad. I\u2019ll see you later. I\u2019ll be home in an hour or two.\u201d But she was like complaining about that. And I\u2019m thinking to myself like this man needs to stop dicking around like get off Carly\u2019s case. If she was at college, she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D4\">be doing worse. You know? She would be doing whatever the hell she wants. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">\u201cYou\u2019re lucky that she\u2019s as good as she is.

Stop dreaming that you\u2019re going to have your own business and do something.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s like Death of a Salesman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t hear any anger coming from my mom. I just hear like, \u201cWell, you know, we don\u2019t talk about that that much.\u201d And then she keeps making these comments that I want to see if your mind goes where my mind goes. But she makes comments about like... (PAUSE) I said something to her along <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201431\">the lines of, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very hard seeing you guys struggle like this because I know that my career is going uphill now. Like here I am. I have this plan to kind of offer myself as a consultant to a group practice so I can run a skills group and maybe get paid while I\u2019m waiting to get on panels <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201432\">and all that, to maybe take on a client or two.

Like I can\u2019t help...\u201d I\u2019m not in a place that I can help them yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20147\">THERAPIST: Oh. You feel bad about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20149\">CLIENT: Financially.

What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, you know, it\u2019s our dream that you have a career. And you have one now. So we\u2019re set. The only thing we have left to do is get Carly hooked on something that she\u2019s interested in and she can make a <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D1\">living. And believe me, after that, nothing else matters. Billy and I will live in a car if we have to. You know, and maybe we don\u2019t even make it until retirement. Like who knows what could happen?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">And so there my mind goes like, \u201cWow, actually having Carly be like this teen, floating around not knowing what she wants to do with her life, is a protective factor because it\u2019s keeping them alive.\u201d Like who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t just murder suicide. \u201cLike, oh. Our kids are set. Let\u2019s not be a burden <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F1\">anymore.

What does that mean to them to have, to just be to themselves? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">CLIENT: My mom keeps making jokes again of, \u201cYou know, one day when I live with you.\u201d It\u2019s almost like I get the sense of when Carly\u2019s out of the picture and she\u2019s on her own and thriving, my mom doesn\u2019t want to be with Billy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">THERAPIST: Oh.

Like who\u2019s going to steer the ship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20171\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20173\">CLIENT: Like I need to have it together. Like I can\u2019t... I don\u2019t even recognize myself when I\u2019m a drunken mess or... Well, I mean, that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t see the other things I\u2019ve done. Like, for example, I could take a look at the fact that I\u2019m with a married man as like shameful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20175\">But I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t. Because it\u2019s more hidden, I guess, because I\u2019m hiding it in calculating who gets to see that part of me. But when I\u2019m in a drunken, out of control state, I\u2019m exposed. Or maybe I\u2019m just in denial. Like things are going very well with Brian (ph). He\u2019s very present. He\u2019s trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201751\">to see me once or twice a week. He\u2019s just been a lot more loving and caring and nurturing. And I pointed that out to him and he said, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m doing that on purpose because I feel like you need it.\u201d And he\u2019s right. Like kind of I\u2019m trying to eat better. I\u2019m trying to be healthy. I\u2019m trying to stay... <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201752\">Be a good girl. Go to bed early on Friday and Saturday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20179\">CLIENT: (inaudible) trying, I guess, nurture me back to health like just the way I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">CLIENT: But yet I have that thing in my head of, \u201cBut it\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But... Yeah. There is some way too of maybe... Does it ever feel like maybe... Gosh. So I was thinking about sort of the direction that he went to when you got in touch with him that weekend was that it really, really frightened him and really scared him that he saw this other side <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F1\">of you that wasn\u2019t the kind of, I think, the kind of the... I don\u2019t know how he... The devoted or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">CLIENT: The devoted pet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">THERAPIST: The devoted pet. The devoted pet. Yeah. You had gone off your leash or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20185\">CLIENT: Well, the other thing I wanted to say... So he came over the other day. And, again, these are the things that Brian does or says that really hurt me. And I have some deep sadness momentarily and then it\u2019s like I can just wipe it away and disconnect from it. He was... We were laying in bed talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201851\">and I said, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo. I just came back from eating. I went out to dinner with a friend.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI\u2019m your friend. Why don\u2019t you ever take me out to dinner?\u201d And he didn\u2019t say anything about it. He just kind of smiled. And I was like, \u201cSo where did you go and with who?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201852\">And he was like, \u201cMy friend...\u201d Some guy\u2019s name. I can\u2019t remember. And he\u2019s mentioned him before. \u201cWe went to have Greek food. He actually just got married and he\u2019s doing well.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cOh.\u201d And I don\u2019t know why I asked. But I was like, \u201cDid you go to the wedding?\u201d He recently got married. And Brian <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201853\">like paused and he\u2019s like, \u201cI actually did.\u201d And I got so sad in that moment because it was just a reminder of like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20187\">He has this whole separate life. And I told him this. I was able to say it out loud. I was like, \u201cYou know, I forget that you have a life with her. She must have gone with you. And you must have gotten dressed up and you couldn\u2019t come to a wedding with me when I invited you to my friend\u2019s wedding. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201871\">you don\u2019t take me out to dinner.\u201d And I just got really sad. And he said, \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t tell you these things because I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou know, the truth is, 90% of the time, all I do is work and have that crazy schedule and write papers.\u201d And I believe him. And he said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201872\">\u201cOnce in a while I have things like this and I don\u2019t feel the need to tell you because I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d You know? And I kind of appreciate that because other... One of the nights that he said he was working, he really wasn\u2019t working and he was at a wedding with his wife all dressed up. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20186-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20186-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20189\">But I\u2019m able to just... Like even right now, I\u2019m... Like I can sense the sadness but... (PAUSE) And I know in here I always say... I remember even... I don\u2019t know if I was with Brian when I was at your last office. But I remember giving myself a timeline. Now I have another timeline. He says he finished <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201891\">his program completely November, December.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018B\">THERAPIST: This year?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like this is his last semester of actual schoolwork, papers and stuff. Then he starts in like five weeks clinicals which is like internship, practicum, then he just works but not for pay. And he has three semesters of that and then it\u2019s over. Two or three semesters. And I\u2019m like thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2018D1\">to myself, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to wait until then and if I don\u2019t have a promise of, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s be together. Let\u2019s let it be known that we\u2019re together,\u2019 then I\u2019ll finish things with him.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018F\">(PAUSE) Part of me thinks like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good plan.\u201d But another part of me is like, \u201cYou know you\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20191\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess, you know, just another aspect of this that just comes to mind as we\u2019re talking about the secrets, you know, that, you know, the secrets that you\u2019re... I guess this came to mind in relation to your mom not wanting to go see her cousin and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20193\">CLIENT: Yeah. Her brother and cousins...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20195\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Now who... So who... So was it her brother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it\u2019s two brothers. The one that she\u2019s pretty close to but the other one is the one who had the son who committed the crime and they went into hiding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. So like that... It seems like... And then she\u2019s not invited to the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019B\">CLIENT: Right. The party. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019D\">THERAPIST: ...to the party. And it just made me think about the kind of the quality of interplay between some aspect of you and Brian and like Brian keeping you a secret and you keeping him a secret, that there\u2019s some sort of function in that, something that\u2019s like... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. Too... Almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2019D1\">like... I was going to say too dirty a secret for you, him having all these secrets about his life without you. (PAUSE) Yeah. That it can\u2019t live in secret. I don\u2019t know. Something about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A1\">THERAPIST: What? What are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A3\">CLIENT: No. Like I see the connection. I just... I\u2019m not sure what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m not sure either. I\u2019m not sure either. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Are you here next Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Now I\u2019m just thinking, just to say about the... (PAUSE) That there\u2019s something... That\u2019s something very important about each of you that needs to be held as a secret in some way. And the same with your mom and like that secret kind of history of hers that\u2019s kind of kept at bay that <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201A91\">doesn\u2019t... I don\u2019t know how to exactly deal with this facet of her life and of history and what kind of meaning that has.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N201A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563447\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.
