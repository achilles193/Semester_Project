One of my friends who got licensed after January said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t, I asked.\u201d And then someone else at work told me yes you do. So I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just going to have to call. I\u2019m going to have to call what\u2019s her name, Nina Hobart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Nina Hobart. She\u2019s still at the helm, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. She\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s kinda scary to call her. Because she\u2019s busy, she\u2019s a busy woman, so every time I\u2019ve called like she sounds really irritated. [laughter] Like, \u201cHow do you not know this?\u201d Because she\u2019s probably asked like fifty times a day. So that was good. What else? I\u2019m at the same I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">last week as far as my complicated relationships. Just saw Brian last night, Brian spent the night. And I\u2019m seeing James tonight. This is ridiculous, I\u2019m like leading two different lives. And the thing is I don\u2019t even\u2026 it bothers me that I don\u2019t feel badly about it. [0:02:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: What do you feel? How do you feel about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m completely devoid of emotion. Like I\u2019m just keeping them separate. I know how I feel about Brian, I know how I feel about James. And I know that with James this is just\u2026 it\u2019s new, it\u2019s a new relationship. You know, it\u2019s not that serious, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve said I love you or planned <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">a future together. It\u2019s just starting. But I\u2019ve noticed that I become irritated with James. Like remember the aggression thing we talked about last time? I saw him on Saturday. So after taking my exam and stuff we had planned\u2026 I mean, he was so sweet, he was like, \u201cCome over and I\u2019m going to treat you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">and take you out, we\u2019re gonna celebrate.\u201d So got to his place and he was, you know, so excited for me and giving me a hug. And then started off the night by going across the street to this little hole in the wall bar from his house that they have like $1.50 beers and these characters. Like he lives <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200353\">in Bunker Hill, so these characters come in. Like there was this woman that was totally intoxicated, and like yelling on the phone threatening to kill someone. Like it\u2019s just like the Jerry Springer show. But we just sit in a corner and laugh and drink our cheap beer. But there was something about\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200354\">I don\u2019t know if it was that woman, like that she was so obnoxious and drunk, or if it was him, but I found myself\u2026 like before we ordered our beers and we sat down I got like annoyed with him. And he wasn\u2019t doing anything, he was just being himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563397\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: What did you find\u2026 yeah, what was it, what did you find annoying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It was just like sweet and understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: It was a weird reaction.

Toughen up, yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: But then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: But toughen up. No, but what about the sweet\u2026 how was the sweet and the\u2026 What did you call it, sweet and what else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Like caring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You were gonna say something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, now I remember. I was\u2026 I was in the car listening to music, and I was in a really good mood, because I was like, \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s over, last text.\u201d So I was blasting a lot of like my Jamaica music, like my hip hop music. And I was like bouncing around in the car and hyper and wanted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">get there. And I guess like when I saw him I was just like, he\u2019s kinda boring. But he\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know why I started thinking that, but I did. Like I was in this party mood kind of thing. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I was like, you\u2019re bringing my party down like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t even know what he had planned for the night. He could have planned something. Like because he was\u2026 he told me when I got there, he\u2019s like, \u201cI have something special planned.\u201d And after having a few beers at the bar he\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to tell you what I have planned. After this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">I was planning to take you to that fancy restaurant again that I took you for Valentine\u2019s Day because I know you really liked it.\u201d And this place is like $32 per meal. So you get that, you get beers, you get an appetizer, it adds up. And I like really felt like having a laid back kind of night, if anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200552\">like music in the background, laughing, having bar food and beers, and he had planned this fancy night. But I told him like in a very sweet, gentle way, and I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely.\u201d Like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really sweet, I did love that place. But what do you think of\u2026\u201d You know. And he was totally down <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200553\">for it too. And that made me happy, that he was flexible. And as I started drinking more then I got all sweet on him. So it changed, it flipped very quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:06:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: But yeah, we ended up going to this like sports bar type of place with music. And oh my God, we got like buffalo chicken nachos. You know, just like all this junk. But that\u2019s what I wanted to do. And the conversation, it\u2019s always so easy with him. Like it amazes me that\u2026 just we could be anywhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">and we always come up with things to talk about and we always laugh. I don\u2019t remember feeling that ease so much on any of the dates I went on. And even with Brian, like there\u2019s nothing to talk about sometimes. He\u2019s just so weird. He\u2019s just so not in touch with his feelings, or not wanting to talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">anything, and he just sits there in silence. And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you thinking right now?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Like if you guys are out to eat or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And if he does talk about something it\u2019s like his martial arts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Not necessarily something I\u2019m that interested in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: But with James it\u2019s like, God, we talk about everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563397\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, but it\u2019s\u2026 yeah, there\u2019s\u2026 I could see though that there\u2019s like\u2026 that something about James kind of elicits a kind of a\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right to call it anxiety, but unfamiliarity I would say more than anything else. Like some sort of sense of like, I don\u2019t know that I like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">this that you sort of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I was going to call it a frustration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: A frustration.

In that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: It should be more anxiety provoking and awkward and uncomfortable. It\u2019s almost like I was angry with him for taking me out to celebrate. Maybe it goes back to this thing of I don\u2019t deserve this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Like I couldn\u2019t have planned for a better night, you know. Like I\u2019ve been waiting for ever for someone\u2026 How many times have I accomplished anything big and Brian wasn\u2019t there to celebrate anything? Even if celebrating meant coming over and spending the night, or having dinner at home. And here\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">James like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna take you out and we\u2019re gonna celebrate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like everything I\u2019ve been waiting for, and then when I have it it frustrates me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, there is just something though that it\u2019s like\u2026 it\u2019s interesting that it\u2019s opening up I think another\u2026 some realm of feeling though. I don\u2019t know what it is, just\u2026 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Another thing I noticed is that I am completely not jealous when James tells me about past relationships and sexually related stuff. But I\u2019m very jealous, but I don\u2019t express it. But I\u2019ve noticed myself becoming jealous and uncomfortable when he talks about loving or caring or thinking that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">that was really special. Like emotional stuff with other women. And I\u2019ve noticed with him\u2026 like I guess since it doesn\u2019t bother me, the sexual stuff, I\u2019ve like blurted out things before like to be funny or something, and he\u2019s joked with me and smiled and been like, \u201cI\u2019m getting really kind of jealous <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200892\">right now.\u201d So that stuff bothers him. [0:10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">And I was just thinking about this in the car. So it seems like James is very much\u2026 for as long as\u2026 since after college it seems like he\u2019s the kind of guy that really wants to be in a relationship. And he once told me that basically everyone he\u2019s every slept with has been his girlfriend. I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">\u201cDamn, you\u2019ve had a lot of girlfriends.\u201d You know, because he told me he\u2019s slept with like about 30 women or something. And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, no, some of them were just like casual hookups, not really girlfriends, but I would sleep with them more than once.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cStill, you\u2019ve been in a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B2\">of relationships.\u201d And I found myself a little bit jealous because like I don\u2019t have that experience I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: And it also seems like he very much loves love, and wants to be in love. And this started coming up for me when he showed me his dissertation. So it was like this book all binded up, and I started reading the dedications. And it named like his family and his friends, but then it said, \u201cAnd absolutely <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">I want to thank my girlfriend and best friend,\u201d and some name. And so I was like, \u201cHey, so is she still your best friend?\u201d And he starts laughing, and he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t even talk to her anymore.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh. She must have been very special to you at the time.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F2\">believe I put that in.\u201d Like, \u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, I mean, it makes sense. At the time you considered her very important to you and your best friend.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, why did I do that?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563397\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">And then I\u2019ve heard him\u2026 like I started remembering things he said about other past girlfriends, like, \u201cOh, she was my best friend.\u201d So I started just asking him questions about like, \u201cSo would you say that every girlfriend you\u2019ve been with has pretty much been your best friend?\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">yeah, I guess at the time when I\u2019m with them it feels like a best friend.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAnd like with how many of them did you feel like you had the potential for a future with them?\u201d And then he started laughing and saying, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little bit judged right now.\u201d And I could see how that might <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200912\">feel like that. And I was like, \u201cNo, but seriously. I\u2019m sorry, like if you\u2019re feeling judged you don\u2019t have to answer anything. But I was just curious because I just\u2026 I\u2019ve noticed that it seems like you\u2019re very much\u2026 you want to be in love, and that\u2019s something that you crave and that you really desire. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200913\">And it seems like in a lot of your relationships you very much wanted that.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s accurate.\u201d [0:12:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">And I\u2019ve noticed that I try very hard with males I\u2019m with to feel\u2026 I want to feel different and special in some way. So I found myself asking Brian things last night. Like he brought up again how he\u2019s sleeping with other women. And although I didn\u2019t want to hear details about it, it made me feel better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">when I asked him, \u201cEven though you do that with them, it\u2019s different, right? Like what we do is special and different? Like you don\u2019t say the same things to them, you don\u2019t do the same things?\u201d And he assured me, he\u2019s like, \u201cOf course not. Like everybody\u2019s different, they wouldn\u2019t want to say the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200932\">that we say or do. Like of course it\u2019s different.\u201d And for some reason that made me feel so much better, like oh, I\u2019m special.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s the same thing I think with James. Because he keeps saying things to me like, \u201cThis feels different.\u201d And sometimes I think like, \u201cYou probably say this to all the girlfriends you\u2019re with, because you just want it so bad.\u201d You know. And he\u2019s like\u2026 I told him the story about how Kevin <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">proposed. And so he kind of made a little joke, he\u2019s like, \u201cSo you\u2019d prefer it if I asked your mother for permission if I ever asked you to marry me?\u201d You know, so he\u2019s abuse already talking about stuff like this. But I\u2019m finding myself kind of doubting. Like is it really about me, or is it just that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">this guy wants to be married and wants to be in love so much that\u2026 So I think that\u2019s pissing me off a little bit. [0:14:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what does he\u2026 Well, yeah, some kind of question about like, yeah, what are his motives.

And that he doesn\u2019t know the whole story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that that\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel terrible about what I\u2019m doing with Brian yet, because it\u2019s just starting. You know, he doesn\u2019t know all of me.

[pause] But I can\u2019t help it. Like I\u2019m not going to stop doing what I\u2019m doing, I feel no need to. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">And Brian is like upping the ante. He\u2019s more dominant and more dirty that ever. And I think that he\u2019s\u2026 I almost see it like he\u2019s doing these things to like draw me in. He said something last night like, \u201cI\u2019m so scared that you\u2019re going to be with this guy for some time and finally realize that you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF2\">keep doing this with me.\u201d I\u2019m scared of that too.

And I played around with trying to make him tell me to do things, which was turning me on. And after he was done like he was done. Like that\u2019s it, like he was ready to go take a shower and get ready for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">day. Like Brian would never do that. First of all, Brian doesn\u2019t ejaculate. Like he Brian go four hours and make sure that I have lost count, and then he\u2019ll go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.

Oh, so he\u2026 it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll ejaculate and then he\u2019ll start up again.

James is learning. He\u2019s doing little things. And he even\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF2\">he\u2019s in therapy, and he\u2019s\u2026 we even talk about like what we share in therapy. I mean, I obviously don\u2019t share the whole stuff with him. But he has told me like, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve told my therapist just about how you wanted me to do different things in bed, and how I was resistant at first, but then I tried <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF3\">it and I really like it.\u201d So I\u2019m like introducing himself to new things that\u2026 You know.

Yeah, no, but I hear it, there\u2019s\u2026 I mean, he offers something very different. And I guess what I hear you say is like what\u2026 what\u2026 this sense of like can sex have the meaning it has with Brian if it takes a form that\u2019s very different. You know, what kind of\u2026 what Brian James offer <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">in terms of a meaningful connection, yeah, through sex? Is he gonna offer something that feels very important and deep to you? Yeah. [0:22:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: There\u2019s these tender moments with James when we\u2019re just close together and we\u2019re kissing, and it feels so tender and so nice. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt that with anyone before. Like maybe with Kevin when I was like really young and na\u00efve and\u2026 I think I caught glimpses of that. Like I\u2019m talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">about when we were in high school. With Brian I don\u2019t feel that, because he\u2019s just so cut off emotionally. He doesn\u2019t even like to kiss. Like he\u2019s just so stiff. Like I remember last night trying to just start just being very sweet with him and hugging him and he\u2019ll just like be like that while I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201032\">hugging him.

You know, just one thought I had about it all is that\u2026 I was thinking that with Brian, and maybe it\u2019s true for you and Brian, there\u2019s a kind of a comfort in going back and forth between the tenderness and the kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">the dominant\/submission thing. There\u2019s a way that he needs that to get into the tenderness, just similar to you, there\u2019s a way that you need that kinda level of raw\u2026 almost like it\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s like a brutal quality to it, interspersed with tenderness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: And yet it makes it more palatable or something like that for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Whenever he\u2026 like whenever he\u2019s called me to have phone sex, or he wants to come over, or something like that. And sometimes like I\u2019ve shamed him for it, because let\u2019s say we\u2019ve been in an argument and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk this out. Like we can\u2019t just have sex and that\u2019s the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201231\">to fix it.\u201d He\u2019ll\u2026 it\u2019s almost like I shame him and I see him put his head down, and he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I wanted to feel closer to my pet.\u201d That\u2019s what he always says. I mean, that\u2019s what he uses to get close. So I think that you\u2019re right when you say like that he needs that\u2014or maybe we both do\u2014that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201232\">kind of brutalness, and then it goes into the tenderness. [0:26:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: See I was thinking about that, as like something about when James was being sweet you wanted to slap him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: Or I wanted to be mean to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you wanted that\u2026 it didn\u2019t sound\u2026 it was like almost as a way\u2026 I wonder if it\u2019s even a way if you can kinda\u2026 it\u2019s a way to kind of have the tenderness.

Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: Like now that I\u2019m thinking about it, it reminds me of how Brian tries to feel with me.

I have to tell him what to do. Or he asks me for permission or\u2026 it just doesn\u2019t come naturally. But I feel like everything else is so good. Like we get along so well, and he\u2019s hilarious. And I told him the other day, like nobody makes me laugh this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">hard except like my little sisters and my mom. Like I laugh all the time, you know, at work, with friends, but like those deep laughs that I like want to pee my pants, that\u2019s what I have with James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.

So I know he\u2019s special. I don\u2019t have any of that with Brian. Like even yesterday in the in between moments when I was trying to be sweet with him and just talk with him, I was asking, \u201cSo how\u2019s Logan? Anything new, any new pictures?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t even show me any pictures, and just one-word <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201531\">answers, like, \u201cMm hm. He\u2019s good.

And\u2026 Like when he talks to me about how I ran off and I\u2019m fucking someone else, and I\u2019m like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about sex. Like all those things that I want from you, like meet my friends and go out with me and do things with me and make plans with me, he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201571\">giving me those things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

At least not\u2026 All he\u2019s focused on is like the sexual stuff. You know, like I don\u2019t think it has even registered in his mind like where he\u2019s lacking emotionally. Like maybe that this guy\u2019s providing something emotionally for me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B1\">he can\u2019t. [0:30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s what I was sensing. Like is it his inadequacy as a lover in some way, is that what he imagines?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: He could never\u2026 I mean, no way. Brian thinks he\u2019s the best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah. How does he get\u2026 what does he have to say about you running off with another lover to have sex with? He sees it as\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: He tries to get me to say things. Like, \u201cTell me about it.\u201d And I\u2019ve said very few vague things. He knows that it\u2019s not the same, he knows that I don\u2019t have orgasms, he knows\u2026 You know, so that makes him feel great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Hm. Yeah. I wonder if in some way\u2026 you know, you were talking about this kind of\u2026 this feeling of not having a lot of feelings about it, about seeing Brian, and then this kind of\u2026 you know, I was thinking this sort of tension came over you around like, well, how does that sound and how do I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20164-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20164-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563397\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: I guess one thought I have is\u2026 and it\u2019s not that it\u2019s the whole thing, because there\u2019s obviously a lot between Brian and you just in its own right. But I was thinking in some way if there\u2019s some way that like\u2026 that to have\u2026 maybe why it doesn\u2019t feel so bad in one way is because it feels like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201691\">it\u2019s an important aspect of what you\u2019re doing to James in some way. Not in the sense of like\u2026 I don\u2019t think of it in terms of hurting him because you want to be cool, but more along the lines of like wanting him to be like\u2026 [pause] \u2026 like it\u2019s almost like a slap in the face that you want to have towards <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201692\">him. [0:32:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: A slap in the face to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: To James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: Like slap his face?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s almost like\u2026 you know, almost like to have another level like a slap in his face or something like that. And I mean that in a sense of like some side of you that goes, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose something that happens with Brian and I.\u201d This kind of, \u201cI want you to know something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201711\">me.\u201d You know, that, \u201cI want to push you on the rocks, I want to\u2026\u201d Something that you feel I think is something important that you don\u2019t want to lose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: To lose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: And in that way\u2026 I know I\u2019m not doing a great job of explaining it maybe, but like I was thinking about in the context of the relationship with James it\u2019s a side that you end up maybe feeling like\u2026 it\u2019s some way of like\u2026 I was thinking about it similarly to Brian saying, \u201cI have more lovers <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201751\">than just you.\u201d Like what it means to him to have that. It\u2019s analogous for you in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: It\u2019s powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s powerful, and I think maybe because of something that gets evoked between you and James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: Okay. You know, it just came to mind that\u2026 I don\u2019t know if this has anything to do with it, but I\u2019ve been having a lot of insecurity around my intelligence around James lately. I kept making jokes, and I didn\u2019t realize this but he pointed it out to me. I think it\u2019s because he did a lot better <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B1\">on the EPPP than I did, and my friend Carly did a lot better than either one of us. And I know it doesn\u2019t matter, like you pass, you pass, nobody\u2019s ever going to look at that again. And they both shared that they got like a 90 on the jurisprudence, and I got an 85. And so I walk through the door and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B2\">he\u2019s like, \u201cYay, good job!\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cSo what\u2019d you get?\u201d And I was like\u2026 the first thing I said was, \u201cWell, you know, not as good as you and Carly, but I got an 85.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy are you saying that?\u201d And I just make jokes like, \u201cWell, you know, you\u2019re whitey and I\u2019m a colored person, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B3\">so I\u2019m an immigrant and we don\u2019t do as well on tests.\u201d Like just throwing out random stuff like that. And he stops me, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019ve been saying that a lot lately. What\u2019s going on?\u201d And I started remembering, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I have been putting myself down.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Mm.

Like his dad\u2019s a psychologist, mom\u2019s a mental health counselor, they both went to Ivy League schools. His\u2026 I think before\u2026 he has uncles and stuff that work for the government. Like he comes from a smart family. Here I am with my father who cuts vegetables <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201871\">and my mom who makes nine bucks an hour at a preschool, and I feel like unequal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yes.

He said, \u201cI\u2019ve never told you this, but besides my wife you\u2019re my longest relationship ever.\u201d And that meant a lot to me, just because I know he\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s not only slept with a lot of women, but he had been in a lot of relationships <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B1\">before his wife. And that felt special in some way. [pause] He repeated that again last night. It just feels\u2026 it feels so dysfunctional. It\u2019s like a mind fuck whenever I\u2019m with him, because like I\u2019m crying, and then I\u2019m upset, and then I\u2019m totally into it and\u2026 It\u2019s a mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Wow.

Ask me about it, I know you want to know.\u201d Like he messes with my mind I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A31\">feel like. But I\u2019m allowing him to. And then ultimately it feels good.

Think about how he must feel. His feelings are hurt. He\u2019s not showing it, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB1\">his feelings have to be hurt.

The only other thing that I could compare it to\u2014but it\u2019s completely opposed, because it\u2019s almost like the angel and the devil\u2014is therapy. The experience I\u2019ve had with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well, what do you know, what do you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D7\">CLIENT: Well, because like I\u2019ve been able to be open and feel and really delve into really raw things that normally I don\u2019t like to think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB\">CLIENT: Because that\u2019s the only thing I can compare it to. And I don\u2019t know why that makes me cry. But it\u2019s like this is good, and this is healthy, and that\u2019s completely messed up. But it taps into similar things I guess. You know, things that other people can\u2019t tap into for whatever. [0:42:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Well, and in this\u2026 and in this atmosphere there\u2019s like a lack of the\u2026 there\u2019s an absence of kind of the sexual or erotic. Are you\u2026 you obviously haven\u2019t talked about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DF\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve told you that I can\u2019t do that, because then it would feel like fake, or not special, or it would\u2026 it would take away something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Mm, mm. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E3\">CLIENT: Like I couldn\u2019t picture you as a real person\u2014at least when I\u2019m in here I can\u2019t picture you as a real person outside in the world, not that much older than me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563397\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">CLIENT: Because then you could potentially like, \u201cOh, I could have dated you.\u201d And that would\u2026 no, don\u2019t go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Ah.

Is that what this is about? Like I have to keep them separate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F1\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s yeah, put\u2026 you know, I think it\u2019s a lot about first of all you really trying to put a lot of yourself together. Really. You know, how much of the good, the bad as you say, the sexual, the erotic. How\u2026 the sense of it being special and pure. And all that stuff, and how complicated <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201F11\">all that is. How that\u2019s so hard and challenging to put it all together. But a lot that you\u2019re trying to kinda shed light on in yourself, and kinda have\u2026 that\u2019s not separated into kinda compartments. It\u2019s not compartmentalized experience. [0:44:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s funny how like I don\u2019t expect certain things to make me cry, and then they make me cry.

What did you notice about the\u2026 what was making you kinda sad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Like it\u2026 [pause] I guess because this relationship does mean a lot to me, and it\u2019s been like the one like corrective experience with a man that I\u2019ve had, and I would never want to ruin it by even entertaining, you know, the idea that you are an actual human man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F9\">THERAPIST: How about that.

Yeah, and you know, it\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s\u2026 I see it\u2019s a hard area to get into, a feeling of not wanting to disrupt something that\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20203\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t know why it brings up tears.
