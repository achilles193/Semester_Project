(inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:03:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: Sorry. I feel like I've got a lot of loose appointments and reschedulings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I should make a note of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: It's okay.

(PAUSE) An acquaintance from William &amp; Mary... Kirsten and a whole bunch of other theologians (ph) at William &amp; Mary have a blog, not Candace though because they didn't ask her to be part of it because she wasn't pursuing a PhD active enough. I disagree. So... We don't really like them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D1\">but I read them anyway. Yeah, it was short sided. Just because Candace's a better thinker than any of them. Like obviously, she's my best friend of all of them but also she's a better thinker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">CLIENT: So anyway, a post on do we as (inaudible at 00:05:19) care about mental illness? Not, surprisingly, I had some thoughts about... (LAUGHTER) So like I've been writing about that and kind of thinking about it and... (SIGH) I feel like I'm sort of at this stage of having a lot of things to say <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200711\">but none of them being very clear. Like I know the woman who wrote this post and like I like her and I know that it's an issue that's very important to her. But I didn't like the post very much. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559799\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">Like she said some things that were very good but also... (PAUSE) I'm like, \"Maybe they needed to be said to that audience. But to me it's obvious.\" Like, \"Hey, every time we talk about depression, we talk about it... Every time we talk about the treatment of mental illness, we talk about it as a sign <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">of like lacks morality and consumer culture of America and that's not doing people who have real problems any good.\" It's like, \"Yes. That is true. Good for you.\" She kind of said... She thought that academy should take a look at social and structural aspects of mental illness. I started a reply. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200732\">said, \"Yes. Let's look at tenure review. Like, let's look at the social and structural elements of mental illness in the academy. Like how is the...\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">You know, basically she was trying to claim a critical distance that she was at the same time saying that she didn't have but she was saying people... I'm not making any sense, am I? (SIGH) Anyway, the upshot is I'm having this sort of involved and protracted discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Do you want to try me again on that other part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Okay. (SIGH) (PAUSE) So like one of the main things that she was saying is that she feels like when people talk about, when people within the academy talk about mental illness, it's like, \"What can we do to help them?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">She's like, \"That's not a very good distinction to make because it's not actually them. Like it's us.\" (PAUSE) To which I say, \"Yes. Yes, absolutely.\" But then she sort of goes on to say, \"So, that means that we in the academy should be able to... We should look critically at mental illness in America <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">and look at the social and structural aspects of it.\" And my thought is sort of like... (SIGH) Which I think it's much more of... I feel like my anger is getting in the way of my ability to think here. But I can't tell whether it's getting in the way of my ability to think of if it's actually helping <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B2\">me think better. My thought is, \"Well, but...\" (SIGH) (PAUSE) I feel that the academy is too busy fostering and exploiting mental illness to be able to think very critically about it. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: But... (PAUSE) I guess I'm thinking about... Like I'm trying to think about the depression and like the last six months or two years or lifetime. I'm trying to think about it and I can't well I'm being like too personal or not personal enough. And I'm trying to talk about it with people and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">I feel like... Like I worry that I am saying, \"Well, I know about this and you clearly don't,\" or like, \"This is what happened to me and you should feel sorry for me,\" which is really not what I'm saying at all but I feel like that's maybe what people are hearing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">But I can't tell whether that's actually what people are hearing or just what I'm afraid that they'll hear. (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) So I got like two Facebook messages in quick succession from a friend from William &amp; Mary, the first one saying, \"Tanya (ph), thank you so much for this comment that you posted <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200811\">on the post. It was really interesting and I'm going to think about it really hard as I try to look at this theologically.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559799\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">And the second comment was, \"Whoa, I just read your blog post about the ECT (ph) and I'm so sorry that I used your intense pain as a stimulus for mental engagement.\" And I wrote back, \"No, that was the point.\" (LAUGHTER) Like I want that. That's why I'm writing about it. I want it to mean something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">other than horrible things happened to me. (PAUSE) But I worry that the way I'm framing it means that I'm the only person who gets to talk. I'm just so... (SIGH) (PAUSE) Because it sort of feels like when I talk about these things with people that are my friends, they sort of tiptoe around me. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200832\">can't tell whether that's coming from them or coming from me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I really don't want people to feel sorry for me. I think more I don't want people to feel sorry for me... (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Also, I feel like maybe in ten years, I'll regret posting such personal things on the Internet. But, oh well, it's what I'm doing now. So... (PAUSE) I have to take care of myself now. I can't take care of future Tanya. I don't know what she's going to need. (PAUSE) I also got sort of pissed <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">off at this blog post because it's just like so jargon heavy. It's like the second... She like dropped a Latin phrase in the second sentence and then went on to translate it. Like, \"No, if you're going to quote Latin, translating it doesn't... It just defeats the purpose.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: First of all, you shouldn't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: It's like using a big word in English and then saying what it means. Either you use the word and people are going to understand or you use a different word. But if you use the word and then explain it, you're being like, having a pretentious...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes. Exactly, exactly. Candace always gets pissed off when people use a Latin phrase that is pretty easy to just use the English equivalent to. It was like \"locus theologicus (ph),\" which is like... I mean, you can just say \"a site for theological discussion.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Like people will know what that is. (LAUGHTER) It's not much longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Right. (PAUSE) But the tagline that Candace and I have on our blog is \"Friends don't let friends use academic jargon.\" I just don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">So I started crying before I could get up this morning. So there's that too. I think I just need to stop sleeping in because I think I'm going to... Like I like getting sleep but then it just makes it worse to get up. It's just really hard. (PAUSE) I feel like... In some way, I, you know, I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">be talking about the depression and the hospitalization and the ECT and all this shit. I want to be talking to people. I want to say, \"This is what happened to me and this is what I've been going through.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">But I feel like I can't talk about that and not be over it. Like, I feel like if I'm going to talk about it, that means there's that much more pressure on me to be okay. (PAUSE) So maybe that's my feeling that I need to have some clinical distance. (PAUSE) It's like things are fine and things are fine <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">and then I just have thirty seconds of like, \"Oh, I can't do this. I can't handle this.\" And then things go back to being fine.

I mean, at another level, I don't think you feel that. They have a right to say, you know... But there's a part of you that feels like they're speaking for you. I guess I get the impression part of your <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">thought is that they should shut up. And I'm not sure quite how it fits but it does seem like you're having some trouble talking about this, like, to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">I mean, it's clear that you've written a fair amount about this on your own blog and I guess on comments about what they wrote and have strong feelings about it. But it sort of felt to me like you sort of petered out in describing it to me. I don't know. Maybe you didn't. Maybe I'm just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: No. I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: ...misunderstanding or misreading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I feel like I sort of started talking about it and was like, \"I don't know if...\" I don't know if this is what I want to talk about today and I don't know if I have enough of a handle on it to actually talk about it, like if I... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">You know, because I obviously can't... Oh, I didn't actually mean that. I wanted to say something else. Like I can't revise clearly.

(PAUSE) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I am reluctant to talk to you about my writing and thinking or my writing and more abstract thinking about this stuff because I am afraid that your internal response will be, \"Oh, isn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E51\">that sweet,\" or something of that, along those lines. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Like in what sense?

If feels like no one will be able to listen to me without feeling sorry for me which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201151\">sort of makes it problematic that most of the things I've been thinking about and wanting to talk about are related to things that people really should feel sorry for me about (LAUGHTER) or like things that are really hard, things that I feel sorry for myself about.

Or, you know, what I'm hearing and you're saying is this thing over here <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">which you thought you were talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah.
