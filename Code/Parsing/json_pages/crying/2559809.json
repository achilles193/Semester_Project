It's terribly funny. (Unclear) theology in my (unclear) was the things I said in reply to like memory loss and to feeling like I had lost myself, my sense of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B1\">self was fractured or much less clear, has made me really not know what to do with what Christianity has to say about the self or the soul, like I just don't think, I haven't seen, I haven't seen that. So like when I was right before I started doing ECT, I heard a sermon that sort of helped solidify <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B2\">some things that I'd been thinking about like suffering, and God and Jesus that I'd never really had very much use for but sort tended to, 'okay, well I can see why' how this works and that was really important to me spiritually, and then I forgot about it. Like totally forgot about it. It was gone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B3\">and then like a month or so ago I read a journal entry I had written describing it and was like, 'oh yeah, that was really important.' And that kind of came back. But like theological anthropology is like the branch of theology that deals with the human person and like the person's relation to God and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B4\">like I just don't know what to do with this. I haven't seen anything on that and nobody I've talked to has seen a good discussion of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559809\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Un huh.

You know things that are horrible and scary, so let's write a paper on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Un huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">(Pause): [00:17:43 00:18:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: And as far as I know, and I don't know very much my Christian theology relies pretty heavily on like Plato and maybe a soul that's like pre-existing and exists after death and is a more or less static thing. And this just doesn't work very well for me anymore. I don't think it ever really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">did but like especially does not right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.

And maybe that's really quite disturbing. Not because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F2\">there maybe something wrong with you, but more so because it means that things could be better or easier. It's a little like the dream. It struck me sort of as ironic when you said something about you had a dream about Dan, or Dan was far away in your dream or something like that, in that I understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F3\">that that was true. He was in their house in Oman in the dream, but of all the things that you could dream about you should dream about moving into his house in Philadelphia.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559809\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: (Laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: (Laughs) I actually hadn't thought about it in that way.

In a sense this was true but in a larger sense, he was not. And that was (unclear). Your statement in the dream itself, which was, 'I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">really don't think it would be a good idea if we spoke,' or we were in touch as though you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

You know, you had the experience of losing that event but actually you're also (unclear) because it came back. You read about it, (unclear) was written about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">it.

I can see how that's disturbing, but again it's sort of in the context of actually things coming back together and not so that you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">sort of recognize that in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: It sort of freaks my theologian friends out a lot more than it freaks me out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: I'm sort of like, 'well, yes.

But my point is, you seem perhaps, to be gravitating towards like what's more disturbing or upsetting in the context of things that actually could feel good or be positive (unclear).

But like it seems counterintuitive when you say that. But at the same time like you sometimes can say things and you're just sort of throwing them out there and sometimes you say, 'I wonder if this is happening,' when it's clear that you're pretty clear that this is happening. And this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B91\">feels a lot like the latter.
