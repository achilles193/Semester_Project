How are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Better, but... still, I don\u2019t feel like me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t, huh? (pause) What do you feel like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: (sighs) Like a younger me, I guess?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Hmm! A younger you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah like, when I get into these really dark periods, it\u2019s hard, because I fluctuate (sighs)... between... like, rational mind and emotional mind. Like, rational mind is, \u201cYou know this is just temporary (sighs), I slipped up, this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a horrible person.\u201d But then, my emotional <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">mind takes over, and I\u2019m just like... Like I don\u2019t see meaning in anything. I could get run over by a truck, and I don\u2019t care. (pause) We got to hear from []on Friday. I got to... I don\u2019t... You\u2019ve heard her speak at BGWU probably, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve never seen her speak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I saw her twice at BGWU.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Not... maybe I did a while ago...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: She\u2019s great. She\u2019s just... like, her conceptualization of things, and she explains everything so clearly. I got to sit like, two seats away from her. It was a really small group, so it was really cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Where was this? At GWU? (client affirms) Wow. Oh, really? Great!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, in a small room, it was like 12 of us and her. The topic was \u201cSelf-Defeating Patterns of Behavior,\u201d so I was like, \u201cAwesome! Maybe I\u2019ll learn something about (chuckles) myself!\u201d She said something... that kind of stuck with me. She said that people with masochistic personalities tend to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">unconsciously stick with those patterns, because either A) it helps them hold onto certain attachments. Like, \u201cOh, look how much pain I\u2019m in; come take care of me.\u201d Or to maintain a personality structure, because they don\u2019t know who they are without that. I think that the second one kind of applies <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">to me a little, because I don\u2019t know who I am without these fuck-ups. (pause) That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah, interesting. Yeah, yeah. What, yeah, follow that. What did you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: (pause) (sighs) I just, I can\u2019t get it out of my mind, that I\u2019m not that... 14-, 15-year-old kid anymore that drinks too much, and gets in trouble for sneaking a boy in, and... My parents gave me the speech of, \u201cWell, you know, now you\u2019ve lost our trust, and now it\u2019s going to take time to earn <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">that trust back up.\u201d I get the same speech from Brian, I got the same speech from James. It took me right back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: (affirms) How about that. (pause) Yeah, like you\u2019re still that person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know... Like, I can\u2019t imagine myself not fucking up. Like, every once in a while, it\u2019s like... I need to remember... something. I don\u2019t know. (pause) (crying) I feel so disconnected from myself, and it\u2019s been really stressful at work. Like, everybody is in crisis. I had to hospitalize <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">someone on Friday afternoon. Then everyone who came in today, it was just like, semi-suicidal or just really distressed. (sighs) It feels like my head is going to explode! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(pause) It\u2019s like, I kept thinking to myself as I\u2019m sitting in session, I\u2019m like... \u201cdamn! I need someone to like, contain me, to like...\u201d You know? (pause) It\u2019s almost like I am in this... like, this whole thing that you\u2019ve been talking about, about me wanting the good man, but going for relationships <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">that might not be ideal. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m living it now. Like, I have an actual person. I have Brian, and I have James. Everything that Brian is telling me, I know is unhealthy, but it\u2019s almost like... he has told me he forbids me to see James, and I\u2019d better get myself straightened out, if I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">keep him, and even that\u2019s not guaranteed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: He said that, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Pretty much. And then James...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Why did he not want, why did he forbid you from seeing James? What did he have...? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Too much feeling. Like, \u201cYou are putting me second,\u201d you know. \u201cYeah, I understood when you were like, messing around and looking to date, and maybe sleeping with someone occasionally. But now, this is a relationship. And I\u2019m not okay with that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: (pause) Oh, I see. So he doesn\u2019t want to be second fiddle, or something. (client affirms) He\u2019s not okay with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: No. He\u2019s like, \u201cAnd I refuse to be treated that way...\u201d (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh, boy. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: He made me confess everything again, because he says that when I was really drunk, I was confessing about like, everyone I ever slept with while I was with Brian. (pause) So, he was like, \u201cYou know, the whole time you haven\u2019t been faithful to me, and I\u2019ve known it.\u201d He said things to me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">I\u2019m not sure to believe him. I think he\u2019s mind fucking me again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">He was saying he used to pay the doorman at my door to tell him who visited me. I don\u2019t even, like, that\u2019s illegal. Like, I don\u2019t think... Or he used to ask Tim (sp), my roommate... And he always knew or suspected, but he wanted me to be honest. Now he knows that I can\u2019t even be faithful, so for a while, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">he hasn\u2019t considered a future with me, since I showed up drunk at his doorstep. He says he has stopped thinking about a future with me at that point, and that the truth is, he hasn\u2019t been sleeping with anybody, and that he thinks I knew that, but he wanted to tease me about it, because he wanted me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">to confess what a whore I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">It doesn\u2019t matter what argument I say. Like, \u201cBrian, even if you didn\u2019t sleep with anyone, you\u2019re married. Like, that\u2019s a very complicated... thing. It\u2019s not like, we have a traditional (crying) relationship, you know? Like, but he\u2019s making me feel like I could never be faithful... I could never be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">like, a woman worthy of him leaving his wife for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, it\u2019s very much a role reversal. Like, almost like, now you\u2019re the one doing to him...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can\u2019t even bring up like, \u201cBut you\u2019re married.\u201d (therapist affirms) \u201cThat\u2019s a different situation, Melanie.\u201d Then he said something to me on the phone like... Oh, and now he\u2019s all about feelings, by the way. Now, he\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this face to face. You wanted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">see it; now you\u2019re seeing it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">He said something to me like, \u201cYou know, do you know what it feels like, that you would go off with James two or three times a week, not even like, answer your phone, or just kind of put me on the back burner. Do you know what that feels like? I refuse to be treated that way.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cJoin the club! <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">Except for me, it was more than two to three times a week!\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with that, because my situation is a little bit different, but okay. I see your point.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, no, it\u2019s just like, it\u2019s now the flip, the inverse of what\u2019s been kind of happening, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: When, on Sunday, before my big presen , I had a huge presentation on Monday, presenting to faculty. I was so nervous about it, because that was... Did I speak to you after it? Yeah. (therapist affirms) So, this happened Saturday, the big event thing, that I drank too much Saturday. Then Sunday <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">was my day to prepare, because Monday was a big presentation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Oh, no. We didn\u2019t talk about it. You were talking, you were saying that you\u2019ve got the presentation, yeah. We didn\u2019t talk, we talked about it afterwards, but you never told me about how it went.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, no. I was so nervous about it and overwhelmed... Brian was the one that kind of pointed out to me like, \u201cMelanie, do you realize this is the first weekend that you\u2019ve been licensed. You\u2019ve been talking about this presentation for like, a month, that you\u2019ve been worried about it. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">I think that everything is just coming to a head.\u201d I agreed with him on that, but then I started kind of panicking on the phone, and crying, and just saying, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t... prepare. Should I call in sick? What should I do?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">He basically yelled at me on the phone and treated me like a soldier! Like, he has a lot of... his dad was in the military, and he has a lot of military friends and everything. He basically said, \u201cI want you to cut this shit out, you\u2019re a fucking professional, you\u2019re going to act like it. You\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">to get off the phone with me right now and fucking practice. You\u2019re going to do a damned good job tomorrow and impress the shit out of everyone, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re good at. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to fucking do, do you hear me?\u201d Like, just talking to me like a parent, almost. Like, a militant <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">parent. But... I didn\u2019t... Like, I reacted well to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Like, it provided some kind of structure for me, and I got off the phone with him and I practiced... Then he became sweet to me, checked in on me even like, an hour later. \u201cAre you practicing? I\u2019m still writing my paper. I hope you\u2019re practicing.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">Then I did the presentation, I got all the validation in the world I\u2019ve ever wanted from Bill, my boss. He told me later on in the week, one on one (this is the first time he\u2019s ever complimented me), and he said to me, \u201cI was really impressed by how you did up there. You know, you have a real gift for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">engaging an audience. I was really kind of blown away.\u201d That was huge!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Nice, nice, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: So, Brian said that Monday after work, he would come and see me. So he came over, and unlike any other time, he sat on the couch with me, and we talked for like, two hours. He was the sweetest, gentlest, most holding kind of person ever. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Wow, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Like, just gave me everything... I needed at that moment, and recognized that I\u2019m feeling really fragile, and just really stressed to me, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad person. You regressed, you\u2019re really overwhelmed by a lot of things...\u201d (pause) And we were just really honest. I was crying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">and I was telling him, \u201cYes, I wasn\u2019t faithful...\u201d I thought it was a big game we were playing, because you know, he would say that that stuff turned him on. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">(pause) I don\u2019t know. It was just... he took things very slow and then the last like, two or three times that he\u2019s had sex with me, it\u2019s a completely different sex. This is not the Brian... It\u2019s gentle. It\u2019s like, loving. (pause) He\u2019s just been very, very soft with me. I know that there is so much about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">that relationship that\u2019s incredibly dysfunctional, and I can\u2019t help but just, it\u2019s so seductive to me. I can\u2019t let go of it. (therapist responds) (pause) James... poor guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what\u2019s going on there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Like I (sighs)... I really made him feel insecure about the relationship. Like, he\u2019s scared that I\u2019m going to leave him. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, if I didn\u2019t love you, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you right now. I would just be like, \u2018Forget that! That\u2019s crazy! I\u2019m not going to deal with that.\u2019\u201c But <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">he\u2019s like, telling me that he has these feelings for me. He\u2019s cried to me a lot of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">He\u2019s dealing with an issue right now, where his mom got diagnosed with bipolar like, five years ago. So, she\u2019s become crazy, he says. Like, she was a good mother when, you know, he was growing up, but in the past five years, she\u2019s become a different person. He doesn\u2019t even know who she is. The sister, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">who is his older sister, has also kind of sided with mom, and become a little crazy herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">Like, they went to family therapy session all together, it was an explosion, and he\u2019s not talking to them anymore. So he\u2019s lost two women in his life, and just has a relationship with his dad. So, he\u2019s being very honest about how this is, just, these feelings with me, and this connection with me, is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">bringing up a lot for him like, another woman in his life and... (pause) It\u2019s just... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: How has that been to hear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I feel really guilty. I feel like, \u201cYeah, why is this guy wasting his time on me? Like, I should just... I should walk away.\u201d But then again like, I can\u2019t for some reason, either. On Saturday, I had a very relaxed weekend. On Saturday, James and I were supposed to talk and get together, so I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">went over to his house and we spoke for like, three hours. (pause) He agreed... Like, I said to him, \u201cI think that we were just going too fast. It all felt so fast!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">He agreed, and he said, \u201cI think we said \u2018I love you\u2019 too fast and...\u201d I said, \u201cJust little things like, your toothbrush is at my house and... I cooked you dinner twice a week. You came over, I didn\u2019t spend time in my apartment on weekends anymore. I didn\u2019t hang out with my friends anymore. It just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">it felt... weird. I think I need to slow things down.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">So... he agreed to that, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sleeping over, because I just wanted to wake up in my house. He got really hurt by that. But I mean... I wanted to be... There were two reasons why I think I didn\u2019t want to sleep over. One, I wanted to wake up in my house and just have a deep sleep, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">nobody bothering me in the morning. But also, I think I was secretly scared that Brian would drive by my house and see that my car wasn\u2019t there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow. (pause) Was there anything about being with James that was unappealing as well? Or in any way, just like...?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: He\u2019s just... I mean, he cries, and he\u2019s sensitive, and he talks about his feelings... I think that still kind of turns me off a little bit. (pause) Like, with Brian, he\u2019s just, he has, he acts like he has all this insight and self-awareness, and he doesn\u2019t. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">Like, I was saying something, I said something to James on Saturday night like, \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I feel like we\u2019re equal. Like, we\u2019re taking care of each other, and I\u2019m not used to that. In my two previous relationships, it felt like... they were taking care of me, and I didn\u2019t have to take care <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">of them.\u201d He said something like, \u201cWell, that sounds kind of unhealthy. Like, this, what you\u2019re describing with us sounds more like a partnership.\u201d And I agree with that. Yet, it\u2019s less appealing to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well, I think one of the reasons is, you know, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s all, it\u2019s everything you can just chalk up to health or not health. It seems instead like, to me, this kind of relationship with James... I sort of see it as you do, you are, you do find him very appealing, compelling in a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">of ways. What I think is problematic is something that you feel like you have to shelf. Some side of yourself that you shelf, and that, I think, came out in spades that night, where you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">Like, when he said, you know, \u201cI love you,\u201d I think it hit something in you about... Again, my sense of it was, it had something to do with, \u201cI cannot lose something of myself, though, here. I do not want to be some, a couple that, it would feel like an artif , that\u2019s just going to be like an artificial <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">healthy, you know, \u2018relationship,\u2019 or we\u2019re just going to go off into the sunset together.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Along those same lines, do you remember what happened right before he said, \u201cI\u2019m in love with you?\u201d (pause) We were outside, he likes to smoke cigarettes once in a while, so he was outside smoking, and I was with him. I was already drunk by that point. I went up to some guy, because he wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">another cigarette. The guy was like, \u201cWell, what are you going to give me for it?\u201d I joked and said something like, \u201cWell, what do you want?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">James saw that as like, kind of flirtatious, but joking. When we went inside, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t like that.\u201d I said something to him like, \u201cWell, you know I\u2019m not being serious! That\u2019s just me, and I\u2019m like, having a few drinks and I wasn\u2019t serious!\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, but, you can\u2019t do that anymore, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">and that\u2019s not the answer I want.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, what answer do you want?\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, I want you to say you won\u2019t do that anymore, because I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s how he said it? (client affirms) Oh, wow. Wow!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: And I just started hyperventilating and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: ...I started losing memory at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Wow! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: (pause) I still don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand why I got so intoxicated, because like I told you, we had had like three beers at the bar like, that big, that big. Beer normally does not hit me like that. And... I don\u2019t know what was going on, emotionally, but I felt like I had some kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">of breakdown or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: There was something that really got... I mean, it was so much more than him just saying, \u201cI love you.\u201d (pause) \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do that anymore, because I love you.\u201d (pause) What are you thinking? Yeah, what... is going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: Like, he has been talking to his therapist a lot and... Again, I told you how that makes me feel like he\u2019s telling on me. She\u2019s a woman, and I don\u2019t know why I have this feeling of like... (pause) I have a fantasy that she\u2019s telling him like, \u201cWhat are you thinking? Get out while you can!\u201d Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200911\">I know he\u2019s, she\u2019s not going to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">(pause) But he\u2019s giving me distance. He\u2019s not texting me as much. Last night he fell asleep without saying anything. I\u2019m like, looking at my phone, but yet I want the space from him, and we are moving too fast, so it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat do you want, Melanie? Like...\u201d You know? \u201cYou were waiting for a good <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">guy to come into your life!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: But I think that\u2019s, I think it\u2019s a good question, though. It\u2019s a fair one to ask. You know, not that it\u2019s an either\/or, you know, but like, what, you know... Maybe the question is, \u201cWhat do you feel like you\u2019re looking for?\u201d (pause) And maybe from him, what are you looking for from him? What are you...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: (whispers) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Because I think it\u2019s more than just... \u201cHey, let\u2019s be this... couple, where we\u2019re in love and everything is, you know, just down the... you know, rose-petal path.\u201d And he, I think there is something about that flirtatiousness that you had with the other guy, that when he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">do that anymore, because I\u2019m in love with you\u201d really, it was so much in that. Not just \u201cI love you,\u201d but \u201cYou can\u2019t do this anymore because I love you.\u201d I was thinking you were probably feeling claustrophobic or something. (pause) Needing your space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Well, that would explain the (rapid inhaling and exhaling) like, the... reaction, that I can\u2019t breathe. (therapist affirms) (pause) I mean, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what to do. Like, I talk to my friend, Carly (sp), who just by saying a few simple words, she... she helped calm me down, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">I was like, feeling like I needed to make a decision. Brian or James? Brian or James? Even though, ultimately, if they find out what I\u2019m doing like, both of them might end up leaving me, and that might actually, I considered that. I\u2019ve considered like, \u201cWhat if I just walk away from everyone? Like, just disengage.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">Carly said something to me like, \u201cWell, don\u2019t make any decisions now that you\u2019re feeling, you know, all overwhelmed like this. Don\u2019t forget that James is not... the be all, end all. He\u2019s not the last nice guy you\u2019re ever going to meet.\u201d For some reason, that felt so good, because I think in my head, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">I\u2019m thinking like, \u201cThis is your opportunity! This is it! Like, here you are, you\u2019re going to be [] in November. Like, if you want to have something serious with someone like, you\u2019d better hurry up and choose!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow, wow. And in a way, you want it, too. You want like, this to work, because of like, these time things and, \u201cHey, this is a really good guy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the timing. Like, that\u2019s what he wants, he\u2019s 35. Now, I have no guarantee with Brian. Like, he\u2019s telling me that he finishes school in November-December, and I still can\u2019t get him to say... Because we were very straightforward with each other, when he made me confess everything. I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">\u201cI want to know that come November-December, you\u2019re going to tell her you\u2019re with me and we\u2019re going to try this.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell me that. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t. Like, you fucked up too many times.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s... I don\u2019t buy (chuckles) that as his reason. I think it\u2019s more that... it\u2019s... you\u2019re looking, and I think on some level, you know that he can\u2019t give you that kind of certainty that James is willing to give you, but he gives you something else, you know, that you feel, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">James doesn\u2019t give you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, no. He doesn\u2019t, just because... not because he\u2019s bad or what have you. Like... (therapist affirms) Yeah, no, he can\u2019t. Like, that Sunday after the whole event happened, James was so good about coming over, and calming me down, and laying in bed with me all day. I would not have felt that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">anxious, had Brian just been there. He just provides something for me like, this kind of safety. But that makes no sense, because like, it\u2019s so uncertain with him!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: But talk about the safety. What do you notice, what do you notice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: Like, he\u2019s completely there to take care of me, that I don\u2019t have to do anything for him. What I was going to say before is, he acts like he has so much insight and self-awareness, he doesn\u2019t. Like, I was saying something to him like, \u201cYou know, when I\u2019m with you, I feel like I don\u2019t have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A91\">take care of you.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s because you don\u2019t, baby!\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, what do you mean? Don\u2019t you ever have moments where you get sad and you need me to build you up?\u201d He was like, \u201cNo!\u201d (pause) That\u2019s not real. Everyone has those moments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Wow. But it\u2019s a very powerful... offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know if it has to do... like, it\u2019s just every little thing like, even his size. He\u2019s bigger than James, you know? Brian is like 6\u20193\u201d or something and like, just an ox. He\u2019s like, big! James is like, 6\u2019 and like, a lot leaner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: So, Brian is, what\u2019s his frame like? Brian\u2019s frame?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Big frame. He does, you know, he does his Kung Fu and everything and just... James was looking through my Facebook pictures and he (chuckles) saw a picture of him. He was like, \u201cdamn, that guy is huge!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? Yeah. Big guy. How much would you guess he weighs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: (pause) He\u2019s not fat, like Reggie was. He\u2019s like, pure muscle. He\u2019s like, just really strong. But he\u2019s not like, \u201croids\u201d or anything like that. He\u2019s just very stocky. (therapist affirms) Like, he could have been a football player, kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Okay, I got it. That\u2019s so funny. I never had that image of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: No? What was the image?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: The image was, for some reason, I had in my mind that he was short.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah! That\u2019s weird. You never told me that, though, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) Obviously, you wouldn\u2019t have, but I don\u2019t know where I got that idea. Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, he\u2019s like 6\u20193\u201d (therapist affirms) James is, you know 6\u2019, he\u2019s taller than me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Oh, that makes, okay.

(pause) But I don\u2019t know why he, it\u2019s got such a strong grip on me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I think there is something there about... something that you were saying about feeling... You know, when you were talking about him taking care of you, and that he... he really expresses like, a certainty. He conveys a sort of certainty of like, \u201cI am here to protect you. You have nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">to worry about.\u201d (client affirms) When you see James cry, it\u2019s, I think in some ways, it\u2019s not only shattering that sort of hope for somebody that would do that, but also, it\u2019s almost like... It\u2019s in my mind, I hear it as a bit of a kind of a reflection back of, \u201cHey, we\u2019re both here, we\u2019re both in <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E52\">this kind of like, unprotected state and I hate it.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s probably...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: I know that that\u2019s healthier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well, yeah, on paper, it\u2019s healthier, right. And I think there is something, of course, yeah, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s dealing with like, in a certain way, the reality of things. Like, you know, on some level, too that Brian is as vulnerable as they come. But there is that kind of, I think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">a kind of a real seduction into that kind of, that feeling of protection that I think you really... I think, one, didn\u2019t really have, and felt like you really still want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Like I told you, I think I told you this on the phone, that whole week, right after it happened, I missed my dad so much. (therapist affirms) It was the weirdest thing. (pause) And I had a nightmare about Billy messing with me. I think it was the night after I spoke to you, or something, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">he was messing with me. Then my mom stood up for me and like, was about to kick him out, but then didn\u2019t, then changed her mind. You know, and I wasn\u2019t even thinking about that during the day. It\u2019s all this stuff about like, my relationships with men that\u2019s coming up. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">(pause) I think I feel like, in a very... agitated state, very anxious and nervous, because I don\u2019t want to lose either one, I don\u2019t want to lose Brian, I don\u2019t want to lose James. This is just like, I feel, I\u2019m trying not to judge myself, but God, I\u2019m greedy and selfish... You know? That\u2019s what I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED1\">like. (pause) Maybe I just... what I want is the unhealthy. Like, someone who\u2019s not going to let me take care of them, but someone who is going to take care of me, and give me the illusion that, you know, of what Brian gives me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I have to say, I don\u2019t know that that... you know, just so like, you\u2019re, I\u2019m clear. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s unhealthy an idea. I think especially based on there is some way that you can feel very unprotected sometimes. I think in some way, James expressing and emoting that to you really <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF1\">must... rattle you in some way. You know, in some way, you know. The immediate response is yeah, disgust and kind of like... but I think it\u2019s some... It\u2019s something that makes you very uneasy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, Reggie used to cry sometimes. It created the same feeling, now that I think about it. (pause) My family hasn\u2019t been very helpful. Like, my mom, she worries about me and she\u2019s been calling. Like, when I had to tell her about the cellphone, I was in the store, because to like, hook up my <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F11\">old cellphone, we\u2019d need Billy\u2019s permission, because he\u2019s the, the holder of the account, or whatever. I felt so bad, and I started crying, because I felt bad telling Billy I lost the phone he just got me... Since then, my mom has been worried and she was on the phone with me after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">She was like, \u201cYou sound more upset than just someone who lost their wallet and phone. Like, what\u2019s going on? Did something else happen?\u201d So, just very briefly, I told her... vague. I said, You know, James told me that he loves me, and that kind of freaked me out. I\u2019m very confused, because I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F31\">I still have very strong feelings for Brian. Then she made this sigh like, \u201cAy! Mamita!\u201d Like just, in Spanish like, disappointment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">Then she said, \u201cHave you seen Brian?\u201d I paused, and then I said, \u201cYes.\u201d She was like, she said something in Spanish that basically meant like... like, \u201cWhat a... (pause) Like, oh my goodness! Leading a double life!\u201d Like, just very judgmental, but I don\u2019t think that she meant for it to be that way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F51\">but it just, it made me feel so judged. (therapist affirms) She didn\u2019t ask anything else after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">She\u2019s been calling and asking if I\u2019m okay. Her way of trying to make me feel better is... \u201cLook at the calendar and see when your next long weekend is. Okay, we\u2019re going to, look up plane tickets, we\u2019re going to see when you can come here, so you can be out in the sun and you know, maybe you need some <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">sun. That\u2019s what you need.\u201d I was looking at tickets, and they\u2019re like, $500 one way. There is no way I\u2019m going to go home! But like, after that, she\u2019ll be like, \u201cOkay, so we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d Like, she won\u2019t keep up the conversation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">Then Billy, the other day, called me because he, you know, he got me a new phone. I haven\u2019t gotten it in the mail yet, but... He said something like, \u201cYou know, your mom says you\u2019re not feeling too well.\u201d Then I broke down crying, because I\u2019m not used to him asking about me. (pause) (crying) I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F91\">know why every time that he asks me like, anything like that, it really, it makes me cry. I don\u2019t know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563423\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">THERAPIST: What do you feel? What do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">CLIENT: (pause) Like, I wish that he had done that more. (pause) Like, it feels good, because it\u2019s like, a man in my life that, you know, does that. But he did it, because he\u2019s a pervert. (pause) His solution for everything is just... ridiculous. He\u2019s just like, \u201cMaybe you need to go away. I saw a roundtrip <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD1\">ticket to Los Angeles for like, $100. Why don\u2019t you go for a weekend?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBilly, what are you, what do you think, what am I going to go to Los Angeles? You want to go to Hawaii!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">Then today, in the car, I just got a text from him, saying something like, \u201cSo are you ready to move to Hawaii? That way, the weather will be better and we can all be together!\u201d (pause) They\u2019re not helpful. (pause) That makes me feel... more alone in my head. (pause) I feel like disengaging from everyone. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF1\">Like, I feel like setting the \u201cpause\u201d button, because I don\u2019t know what to do with James, I don\u2019t know what to do with Brian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Have you felt that here, with me? Did you feel like putting the \u201cpause\u201d button on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: (pause) No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: No?

(therapist affirms) Believe it or not, I had fleeting thoughts about that like, just quitting therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah? Was there, can you say anything about that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">CLIENT: Like, I just started thinking, \u201cWow, he\u2019s going to see that I\u2019m in need of more. He\u2019s going to encourage me to try and do twice a week. I probably can\u2019t do that, because of my schedule, and I probably shouldn\u2019t do that, because I can\u2019t afford it. (pause) I should just... like, stay home. I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F1\">just stay home, and hide in my house, and do nothing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah, was there anything about the way I put that to you? The, you know, the two times, that felt...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">CLIENT: No. I mean, I would\u2019ve... I would love to be able to come twice, if I could. I don\u2019t know if I can. (pause) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like, unconscious too, like, \u201cOh I\u2019m getting to be too much of a pain. Give him a break!\u201d But that\u2019s not in my conscious mind right now. I can\u2019t say that. But I just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201131\">I feel like disengaging. So yes, the thought has been fleeting. Like, I had the fantasy today of, \u201cWhat if I just didn\u2019t show up?\u201d (pause) And I was like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">THERAPIST: What do you think? Did you play that out? Yeah, what was that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was like, \u201cWell, he\u2019d probably call me and in the back of his mind, he might be a little concerned for my safety, because I had said like, \u2018I was feeling a little bit suicidal.\u2019 And what if he just never heard from me? And I never responded...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: (pause) What do you think that would be like for me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, you would... wonder what happened. (pause) But it\u2019s not like, you\u2019d make drastic efforts to find out. Like, you know? (pause) Like, I do the best... I\u2019m thinking of a client I have right now, I\u2019ve been working with her for two years. I know she\u2019s pulling away, because graduation <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B1\">is coming soon. She hasn\u2019t showed up in like, three weeks. I\u2019ve called, I\u2019ve left messages, but I can\u2019t like, show up at her house. You know? (pause) (chuckles) And I don\u2019t have that wish, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking!

(pause) \/aside: What is it?\u201d (therapist affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20149\">Then like, when I started... when we talked that day, that he came over, I tried to slow things down and just like, \u201cDo you realize how hard it is for me to let go of this, because you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re not sure if you feel about me this way, if you want a future with me, and you\u2019re married! Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201491\">this is a good guy, who\u2019s offering me a lot of things, and it\u2019s just, it\u2019s hard to turn my back on that.\u201d He doesn\u2019t get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014B\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah. I think that has a lot to do with something about him wanting... to put you in the position he feels in.

(pause) Like, I feel now like I\u2019m under his watch, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Like, protected in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20151\">CLIENT: Like, I have to be careful if... Like, I was freaking out when I drove to, Saturday night to James\u2019, because I was like, \u201cWhat do I do if Brian texts me? I\u2019ll have to pretend I\u2019m with a friend or something.\u201d Now I\u2019m really hiding, but I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t get out of that pattern. I can\u2019t let go <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201511\">of either one. I\u2019m not ready to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20153\">THERAPIST: Is there something still like, anyway, is it, but is there something kind of compelling about him being... watching over you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20155\">CLIENT: I love it! (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What is it? What is it like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20159\">CLIENT: He\u2019s paying so much attention to me now, you know? Calls me and, \u201cHow are you feeling? How are you doing?\u201d (pause) He\u2019s been seeing me more frequently. On Monday morning, I had to go to the bank. So I had like, an hour or two to go to work late, before my presentation, my big presentation. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201591\">came over that morning, just to hold me, and talk to me and... He said like, make me calm before my presentation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015B\">(pause) I\u2019m like, addicted to him. I\u2019m addicted to Brian. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015D\">(pause) I mean, I get this feeling when... Like, the other day, he came over after a shift. He had to work like, just four hours, and then he came over for the rest of the night. It was like 3:00 a.m. when he came over. I was half-asleep. He laid in bed, and I just put my arms around him, and just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2015D1\">it was like heaven. (therapist affirms) (pause) He lays there, stiff. I remember, I\u2019ve been commenting on that lately. I say, \u201cHug me back! You never hug me back!\u201d He\u2019ll be like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015F\">But... the thought that came to my mind when that happened was, \u201cOh, my God! This is like, my father, who I sit across the table from, when I go out to lunch with him, and he has nothing to say to me.\u201d I\u2019m like... \u201cSo, Dad, how are you?\u201d And he\u2019s not giving me anything back. (pause) When I think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2015F1\">this, in those terms, I\u2019m just like, \u201cMelanie, what the fuck are you doing? Like, this is the unhealthy relationship. You\u2019re repeating the pattern, you\u2019re trying to... make Brian your daddy! You\u2019re trying to get what you didn\u2019t get with your paternal figures, and...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20161\">THERAPIST: Well, and I think it\u2019s a real way, though, to get something that you feel like you need, in terms of a very tangible, felt, proven kind of sense of feeling protected, that\u2019s somehow... is more elusive with a guy like James. (client affirms) It\u2019s so much more ambiguous. (pause) I mean, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201611\">the thing with Brian is, yeah, it\u2019s more of the, I think there is a sense of it being, kind of, is it an illusion or isn\u2019t it? Here he is, this 6\u20193\u201d guy who knows Kung Fu and (chuckles) Jiu-jitzu is his, is that what it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20163\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what he... what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20165\">THERAPIST: And there is a sense of a real kind of concrete kind of way that he\u2019s... he\u2019s power ... like, those things, and the way he, the concrete real things he says about, \u201cI am here for you. You do not have to worry about me. I am... I am the strong man.\u201d That seems so important to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20167\">CLIENT: (pause) (sighs) I feel a little more calm.
