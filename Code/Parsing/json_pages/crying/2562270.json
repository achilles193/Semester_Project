So we didn\u2019t make it to that. Because it takes 45 minutes to get there by subway and so I think we rescheduled for this afternoon. I just, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">really don\u2019t deal well with situations like that\u2014with cars breaking down, specifically. I really don\u2019t deal well with it because my expectation is that somehow it is my fault and that James\u2019s going to be really really angry at me about it and I have to do something to fix it, but whatever I do is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">to be the wrong thing and James\u2019s going to get really angry at me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And so I\u2019m sort of stuck between like\u2014I can\u2019t just leave the scene. I can\u2019t just walk away and be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go take care of myself. Let me know if you need anything.\u201d But I can\u2019t think of anything to say or do and so I just like\u2014it\u2019s really bad. So I did end up just leaving and I just sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">of get myself under control and I get so scared. (inaudible at 00:01:59) and actually being just crisis is way less bad. So like when we a couple summer ago, when the propeller fell out of the boat. That would have been really bad except that the water was really high and the waves were about to smash <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">us against the rocks and capsize the boat, so it was actually a near death situation and I\u2019m fine there. (Laughs) So we just hopped out and fixed it and then it was okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">But that was just always how it went. Something would go wrong and somehow it would be my fault and pop would yell at us. Sometimes it was Amanda\u2019s fault or Jason\u2019s fault, but usually it was Amanda\u2019s or my fault or both of us at the same time. And it would be like the world was ending and there\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">nothing I could do except sort of like clamp down and wait for it to be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">That was my morning. (Sighs) I talked about it with James afterward and it wasn\u2019t actually my fault. I thought that this one (inaudible at 00:03:28) because I noticed that the tire was a little bit low a couple days ago and I\u2019ve been like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll check the air at some point\u201d and then I forgot. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">But it turned out it picked up two nails so there wasn\u2019t anything I could\u2014and it was driving fine the last time I drove it. There wasn\u2019t anything I could do. Whatever. And James has a kit to plug it so he just plugged it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:03:53)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t really know. So he passed it. It\u2019s fine. (Pause) So we sort of made a plan for what to do next time something like this happens and basically James\u2019s going to want to be in charge of fixing it anyway and he\u2019ll tell me if he needs my help. And so I\u2019ll just say, \u201cOkay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">Well, I\u2019m going to go away and make some tea and that\u2019ll be okay.\u201d You know, we\u2019ll see how it actually works, but it\u2019s good to have a plan. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: [You get really terrified] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It (ph) was funny, like, papa never hit us and I\u2019ve never been with someone whose hit me, but what I imagine is just that James\u2019s just going to punch me in the face. Like that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. [He was] (ph) like that would be the preferable outcome. (Pause) I can\u2019t really think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">when I\u2019m like that. Like, I can\u2019t make myself form words. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like an eclipse.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562270\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">It helps that like, you know what\u2019s happening. I can tell myself that you\u2019re not reacting to this situation, you\u2019re reacting to other situations and you know, pass. You just need to go wait for it to pass. Like, once I can get to the point where I\u2014and it gets worse because I feel like I still have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">be able to function in it. Like, I feel like I can\u2019t just say, \u201cOkay. I can\u2019t deal with this and I have to go and pay attention to what\u2019s going on with me.\u201d I feel like\u2014it\u2019s hard for me to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re (inaudible at 00:07:36) to stay on the hook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s hard for me to sort of admit that this is what\u2019s happening or say that this is enough of an excuse for me not to deal with this right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Right. That does remind me of, a little bit, of sometimes in here, where you\u2019ll feel really overcome and upset but I feel like it\u2019s still really important that you, you know, [for me to] (ph) come here and hear what you\u2019re saying and\u2026 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of after the fact when I think about it, like, \u201cNo. It\u2019s not that important that I be able to deal with something right then.\u201d Because in some ways it\u2019s only this bad when it\u2019s not an emergency that has to be taken care of right then. Most of the time, you know, when we break down <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">on the side of the road, okay, then we have to do something right then. But most of the time it would be just fine to say, \u201cOkay. Break for 20 minutes and then we\u2019ll come back and deal with it.\u201d And that\u2019s sort of my approach in problem solving anyway. (Chuckles) Put it down. Calm down, and then come <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">back and fix it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">But, I don\u2019t know. I feel like it\u2019s really irresponsible or something. (Pause) I\u2019m having a rough time. (inaudible at 00:09:28) was like in some ways just really wonderful and in some ways really stressful. I really hate saying this, but like, it was great but it really was not what I needed right now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s just like\u2014I have no idea what\u2019s up with him. He didn\u2019t want to wait for the bus. So we\u2019re [standing outside] (ph) at my friend\u2019s condo and going downtown for dinner, going out to the Square.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: South Denver? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: South Denver. Yeah, sorry. South side isn\u2019t actually a thing in the city. (Laughs) (inaudible at 00:10:33) going to the Square area and so I was sort of planning it because I was like, \u201cOh, well there\u2019s this restaurant and it\u2019s like really good.\u201d And so I was like, \u201cWe should take the bus.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">There\u2019s a bus that leaves from like two blocks away from Marla\u2019s apartment and goes to two blocks away from the restaurant and like, that is really as good as it gets. (Laughs) And pop (ph) was like, \u201cNo. We should drive. We\u2019ve got a car.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWe really don\u2019t want to be parking downtown.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">And he was like, \u201cLet\u2019s look up parking spaces.\u201d I looked it up. I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like $10 to $30 if we can find a parking garage downtown.\u201d And he just like kept going. And he\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, you know. Whatever you want to do.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s take the bus.\u201d And he\u2019d be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">like, \u201cNo. Let\u2019s not do that.\u201d So finally, he was like, \u201cWell, you know, let\u2019s just not make any decisions.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s not actually an option.\u201d (Laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562270\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">So we did eventually take the bus and none of us had the Next Bus App, and he couldn\u2019t handle the thought of waiting for longer than three minutes for a bus to get there. And there were taxis going by. I was like, \u201cWe could take a taxi.\u201d And he\u2019d be like, \u201cNo. No. We\u2019ll wait for the bus.\u201d And then he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">would just like wander away or be like, \u201cGosh. When is this bus coming?\u201d Or kind of say something snarky. And you know, it was the bus that comes every 15 minutes, which again, is about as good as you\u2019re going to get. This is just living in a city. This is the way it is. (Chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">And this was like the end of the day. It had been like a whole day of things like that. Like, he also wouldn\u2019t wait for the crosswalk signal ever. He\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, we can go.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cI don\u2019t ever jaywalk unless I know the area because traffic patterns are hard to predict sometimes and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">people drive fast. He\u2019d be like, \u201cOkay. Okay. Well, let\u2019s just go this time.\u201d (Chuckles) And then just starts wandering. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s hurrying. He doesn\u2019t walk fast. (Laughs) He just wanders out into the road. So on the way home, when he started to like\u2014at first I was like, \u201cYou know, the bus <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">will be here in a second.\u201d Like, \u201cJason (sp?), look up when the bus is coming. It runs every 15 minutes. It won\u2019t be that long.\u201d Trying to sort of reassure him, and when he started it out on the way home, it helped that he had something to drink. And I was like, \u201cYou really don\u2019t like waiting for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200333\">bus do you?\u201d And I think I kind of shamed him or maybe shaming is too strong of a word, but pointed out to him what was going on. (Laughs) And so he just shut up and waited for the bus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: All that was really quite stressful for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: That had cost you a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s hard to really explain to people because when I relate any individual thing, it doesn\u2019t seem like something that is more than like a minor irritation. But it all just like adds up and it also is sort of freighted (ph) in ways that are hard to\u2014are weighted. I don\u2019t know how to say it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Freighted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Freighted. Yes. Thank you. I was thinking of the word \u201cfreighted\u201d in my head (inaudible at 00:14:39).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:46)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: (Laughs) But, you know, he\u2019s trying to come and do something nice and spend time with me and take care of me, and so like I feel like that just puts more pressure on me to be well or be able to handle it or how what he\u2019s doing is actually what I need. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">We did walk by my church and made fun of all the statues. That was fun. (Chuckles) There\u2019s a really great one \u2013I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen this one in the Square, but there\u2019s a statue of [], who\u2019s the very famous preacher the church was built for, but he\u2019s like standing and got one hand on the bible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">and the other hand is like making the peace sign, or like the blessing. And then behind him, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s supposed to be Jesus, but it\u2019s got like this big, long Monks cowl and looks very grim and ominous, and he\u2019s got his hand on his shoulder. It looks just like\u2014I\u2019ve (ph) said it looked like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">the angel of death, Jason (sp?) said it looked like a scythe lord. It was ridiculous. (Laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562270\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">That\u2019s sort of what we do as a family\u2014mocking authority. I feel good (ph) about that. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:27) when you\u2019re talking about that, absolutely I believe that (inaudible 00:17:37) makes sense, but it also (ph) seems like you\u2019re trying to kind of veer away from how really quite stressful it was to have your father in town this weekend, but (inaudible at 00:18:03) had <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">a way that sort of kept this conversation going. I mean, (inaudible at 00:18:10) trying to keep the conversation from breaking down a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Even though I think you\u2019re really into (ph) at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: That pretty much describes my weekend. Yeah. I\u2019m not doing very well. (Pause) Sort of feels like nobody really has the space or time for me to not get better now. Like, while I was in the hospital, took a week basically off, staying in touch with people, or doing things that I was supposed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">do. And well, now that\u2019s over and everybody sort of needs me again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">And you know, James (ph) needs to not be worried about me and the undergraduates (ph) need me to go back to work, and people at my church need me to sort of pick up the things that I dropped and\u2026 (Pause) I know that this is the exact wrong approach to this but I sort of feel like, well, I can just keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">it together and act like I\u2019m okay and maybe in a few days I\u2019ll feel better. Maybe I\u2019ll be okay. (inaudible at 00:20:06) (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: You know, one thing I\u2019m thinking is\u2014I feel bad. I think it might have been, maybe I should have said last week, \u201cLet\u2019s figure out how to make it through your fathers coming this weekend. Your [side of the hospital] (ph). Your, you know, kind of recovering and that\u2019s always really overwhelming <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">and costs a lot when he comes to visit. And I know he\u2019s well intentioned, and I know you\u2019re going to feel really guilty, but this is just not what you need right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">I\u2019m not saying that because you\u2019re telling me anything about the visit that I\u2019m surprised by. I mean, I\u2019ve heard this one before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean like, \u201cOh my gosh. Didn\u2019t see it coming.\u201d I just mean, I wish I had (inaudible at 00:21:34).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: (Pause) It would have been really hard for me to tell him not to come. I\u2019m not sure what the balance there would have been. Like, which would have been worse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:22:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: And that was sort of like why I didn\u2019t tell him not to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. My hope would have been to try to find some way to take it off of you a little bit. Like, you know, \u201cI\u2019m saying this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: That would be great. (Laughs) (Pause) Doctor called to check up on me a few days ago, so that felt really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good. Yeah. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, you say that and it feels like, in some ways very nice or maybe gratifying to hear, but it\u2019s also just like really unsettling. Like, I don\u2019t know what to do with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Do you know which part of it is unsettling? Like, the fact that I\u2019m saying I wish I had done something different or [the fact of what it was] (ph)? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I think the fact that you\u2019re saying you had done something different. Particularly that you wished you had done something that like, under normal circumstances you wouldn\u2019t do. Like that\u2019s not how you really roll. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562270\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Not really how I roll. Yeah, that\u2019s true. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s unsettling that you would think that was important. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">I guess like, I get very, sort of tightly wedged in this mindset that when things are hard like this, I should just handle it. Like, I have to just sort of push through. You know, I think because if I don\u2019t, I have to deal with them and things are so hard. (Cries)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">It sort of feels worse to have you say that \u201cMaybe things don\u2019t have to be this hard.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: In a sense that it would be easier if I said, \u201cWell, you need to push through?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if easier. It would make more sense. So, it was easier in some ways. Easier to sort of get my mind around. Not actually easier to do. (Chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">These kids\u2014I\u2019m sick again. Like, really? You have to be fucking kidding me. (Laughs) Ursula (sp?) still does have a cold and definitely still coughing on me and I was just sort of hoped that maybe she wasn\u2019t contagious anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Maybe I also made you nervous that I was saying something not exactly that I made a mistake but something in that direction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes, which is weird because it doesn\u2019t make me nervous when I think you\u2019ve made a mistake. (Laughs) Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: It seems somehow related to me to your idea that you should just keep pushing through. The idea that I don\u2019t make mistakes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: It sort of feels like it\u2019s related to\u2014one of the ways that I deal when things are bad is just having the assumption that what I\u2019m doing is the best thing that can be done and that there\u2019s not a way to make it easier.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">When I was in the hospital, in my room, there was a board with a like, \u201cWrite an inspirational thought or write your thoughts and post them.\u201d And so like various other people had posted things and one of the things was like, just push through it, was what it said. And I got another sticky note and put <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">it on top because I didn\u2019t want to look at that all day.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s related to the idea that whatever problem (ph) there is, it\u2019s kind of on you. And on you to deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: It sort of reminds me of the feeling when the car breaks down, I have to be able to sort of be present and help and deal with it there. Because (ph) even going away to take care of myself is (inaudible at 00:32:47) or like abdicating (ph) responsibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Which is why the car broke down in the first place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: I mean, that\u2019s how you feel. Like, it was your fault. You must have dropped the ball (inaudible at 00:33:06) someway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I always feel that way regardless of whether there\u2019s any possibility that it\u2019s my fault. Like, sometimes if it\u2019s clear to me that it\u2019s definitely not my fault, I feel slightly less guilty about it. (Laughs) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: I think otherwise, you\u2019re in a world where other people make mistakes and also where your feelings matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: You can\u2019t have (ph) that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Much more (inaudible at 00:34:01).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. If my feelings matter then I have to deal with how unfair things are. (Pause) (inaudible at 00:36:27) a couple of hours of sleep. I\u2019m going to couple\u2019s counseling to make it up and I have something at church this evening.

(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: [In a way] (ph) you\u2019re also saying you have more flexibility with this when you\u2019re here with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: More flexibility with what? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: With, like how much you let in, with being upset, but it\u2019s not a catastrophe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s all the time here, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like, I just want there to be more options so badly that it just really hurts when there aren\u2019t and it sort of feels like you\u2019re asking me to ignore\u2014like I feel like I don\u2019t necessarily consider that there might be more options for good reason sometimes or for\u2014I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think I know what you mean. That you feel like I\u2019m saying you\u2019re sort of in a way, distorting the reality here by imagining that it\u2019s either pushing through or falling apart. Actually, there are other things you could be doing so why aren\u2019t you doing them? Something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yes. But then I feel like so much the narrative of my depression is me saying, \u201cThere has to be more options.

I have one more question about that, which is \u2013I guess maybe you answered it.
