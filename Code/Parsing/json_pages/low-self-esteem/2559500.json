Oh boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: (Laughs) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I had a weird weekend (laughing) and week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I'm still trying to recover. (Laugh) There was this conference this week in D.C. There were like 12,000 people gathered at the convention center and so I learned a lot. I just hope I can learn from experiences rather than just putting them aside because they're too scary to deal with, you know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">Rather than run and hide or something. (Laugh) They put me on the panel, like my (unclear) and it was you know, like I had never been on a panel. (Unclear) and I didn't really know what I was getting into and how to prepare for it. I didn't really prepare for it, which I think showed. And like I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">embarrassed now like doing it and do it and then later on relive the experience and it's like torturing myself so that's what's been happening. Like the panel was about influence and they've taken one instructor and his student and one instructor and her student to talk about working under a mentor <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200313\">influences you and this and that. Well, the other people were very much prepared like the student had studied with the professor for a full three years and now she's been out and like they've had a much longer relationship that spanned years and so they spoke for most of the time and I learned a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200314\">and was taking notes and spoke very profoundly and philosophically. And then I had to speak right after the instructor and he's like very surprised and everything like then I started out saying, 'I'm scared (unclear) a lot.' (Laughs) And then I said something very, very basic and when I said something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200315\">controversial everyone was like, 'whoa, whoa.' (Laughs) I was like, 'okay, I'm making a fool of myself here.' And my instructor sitting next to me and she was like, 'you better be quick because they took a long time,' which was good because they had more to say. So she and I were just like did our piece <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200316\">very quickly. And she and I have only known each other for a very few much shorter time, a few months and we've met like three times for tea and that's not really a relationship and when I was thinking about it I kept thinking about my teachers at MSU with whom I had a much longer kind of an engagement. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200317\">I was reliving that and feeling very embarrassed. Why did I say this, why did I do that, why ? (Laughs) I was so high strung, so nervous, so weirded out right after the program that lasted like all what do you call it like I felt so disjointed and like displaced what is that word? Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Disoriented?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't know where I was and I was texting like I texted a few people like 'are you guys doing anything tonight?' And these women with whom, we've like formed an initiative, we had a panel last week (laughs) I've become a panelist. (Laughs) But, yeah, they texted back and said, 'yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">come over.' And I spent like two, three hours with them talking and it was the most strengthening and enlightening hours in a long time. And even my mom came to the panel. That's another story. Our relationship is like a minefield now. (Laughs) We just pick like vultures at it and we like (Laughs). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">So my mom comes and we're critiquing her dress or whatever. She comes and I had to like jump through hoops to get them in because you don't go you can't just attend a panel at the conference. You have to register and I had to borrow badges from my colleagues to wear there. Lesson learned don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200353\">invite your family members to your professional things. She sits in the front seat next to my current professor, this guy who is very (unclear) and (unclear). She sits next to him and she starts dozing off. And she's asleep for most of the panel and when my turn comes I didn't look at her so I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200354\">no idea if she is awake for my (unclear) or not. I was so like, I almost said to the guy in front of the mic, 'mommy, wake up.' (Laughs) That would have been funny but that's an occasion to be profound and you know, like, anyway what was I saying? Yes. So I went to these two women's place, mother\/daughter, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200355\">and was telling them about the panel and like all the anxious feeling that kind of channeled into words like a broader critique of patriarchy in the work we are trying to do. It was very strengthening, you know, like and she brought me pie and tea and we were like, it was so soothing because earlier <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200356\">I was so disoriented and anxious when I was walking back from the panel with my mom and Chris. And I was talking to Chris and I realized this was not his forte. He just cannot I mean I was like torturing him too. \"How did (unclear) sound? How did (unclear) sound?' So I walked straight back to their <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200357\">place and spent like a few hours talking with them about all this. And her daughter has gone through a similar thing like me. She had a breakdown and she's older than me and she said it took her a long time to get straight with therapy and all like she said she was very shy and now it took her all this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200358\">time to get into a PhD program and do that, but I mean that was very strengthening for me to learn that I'm not just feeling weird all by myself. I'm not there's a reason why I feel awkward, because there are all these things that are expected and I'm not sure I mean like I just felt, 'oh my God, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200359\">what have I done? I'm so dumb. I didn't prepare.' I didn't even think about the whole comparison. Oh, the poets had a longer engagement and my teacher and I haven't had any engagement and I didn't even look at her objectively. I was just so caught up in like the reaction, like the reactive world was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003510\">so like (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559500\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">And there are very few people, there are all these panels that are so much more important with so many more famous people. Like 20 people must have been there at our panel so that's not much. And like Chris kept telling me, 'don't give yourself too much importance.' It's a very hard lesson to learn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Too much importance in terms of -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559500\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well you know, like you're so caught up in your own personal thing, like 'oh, I'll make such a fool of myself' and someone like Chris would say, 'you're giving too much importance to yourself.' You know, think about it in a larger perspective and no one's going to remember and everyone's has <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">a -' I guess that's what he means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">(Pause): [00:11:43 00:11:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: So trying to put it behind is not going to be easy, but it was just this Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">(Pause): [00:12:03 00:12:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I just feel like the whole time this woman was talking to me and feeding me pie (laughs) I was like, 'my God,' this is so amazing and Chris, his judgment is so far away right now. Because he always says, 'you know, that woman, she's not, she -' because we meet each other not socially, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">discussions every week and Chris's always putting her down like he's always like, 'she doesn't have anything interesting to say. She always says the same thing. I'm so bored.' He really dismisses her and when she was talking to me on Saturday I was just like this is so nurturing, this is so kind, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">is so amazing. Why is this one standard applied to everyone? But no they have to say something interesting and profound all the time. You know, why is this fucking standard only take it away. There is just so much beauty in the fact I mean it's a clich , perhaps, again, you know. Another judgment, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">you know? But it was nurturing to have that done to me, you know? I mean my mom wouldn't be able to do it. And I know that she loves me a lot, you know? And she wouldn't have known and this woman just did it so easily, you know, with such flair, you know? So unconsciously, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">(Pause): [00:13:47 00:13:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Why isn't nurturing important? Where would we all be without nurturing, you know? Without love? Without nice things having been done to us? And I could just tell that something in me had changed because that woman from my workshop called in the evening. She'd said, like promised that she'd come <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">to the panel. She's the one I had the fights with. So she called and I was just amazed at my reaction. She's like, 'oh, I'm so sorry I couldn't come.' And if I hadn't had that talk with those women if I hadn't been at home by myself I would have like strangled my friend, you know. I would have emotionally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">I would have put her down and make her feel bad. I know that that was what I would have done. But I didn't. And she said she had some food poisoning and I was actually kind to her, like I said, 'oh are you okay now? Don't worry about the panel. It was a learning experience for me but it wasn't, I didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200473\">prepare for it that much and I'll tell you about it later so you don't feel like you missed out. Don't worry. I'll see you later.' Where did that come from? I'm not I wouldn't have been kind to her, you know. I would have felt betrayed, abandoned and all those negative things. But I didn't and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200474\">is because someone brought me pie when I was feeling so down. You know? And I don't care if what she says doesn't sound profound to anyone. You know. So it was just like (sigh), I don't know. (Laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">(Pause): [00:15:54 00:16:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you were very aware of this woman's impact on you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, she you know I was sort of wary of her because you know, like and you'll say, why do you give Chris so much importance? And I feel like I don't know you tell me. (Laughs) But yeah, no, Chris is like 'she's not that profound,' so I would always be like affectionate with her, not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">too much, but then I'll just kind of take that into consideration, like use that perspective and the initiative is a very new thing but you know. She's been very encouraging. She's tried to be very encouraging to me like with my writings, earlier also, but like just being able to say, 'oh my God, my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">teachers,' you know, and I feel either patronized or what is the opposite of patronized? (Laughs) You know, it's always like that and then like, 'well, there's this patriarchy at work here, we're all struggling, we should strengthen each other.' So that was useful and wasn't like, 'oh, I'm dealing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D3\">with this on my own. No one else feels this way.' And that's completely not true. The power of the collective and all that, you know, is actually really true.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559500\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">(Pause): [00:17:59 00:18:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: I haven't really talked to my mom since the panel and Chris was like she's very scared of you, you know.' Like well she is going to come to my panel, sit up front and fall asleep and (unclear). I'm very upset you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: What were you hoping for with having her there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: I don't know. (Laughs) Because my professor is like 'we're all going to come to this.' And I was actually relieved by the time it was going to start. I was like, 'please, no one come so I can cancel.' Oh. I don't know, I wanted her to be proud of me, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">(Pause): [00:18:58 00:19:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: I mean it is for me. Why can't you do simple, basic things, like not fall asleep, like it's certainly not that hard? You take your jacket off. You get some tea in your hand, you know, you do things to stay awake. You're not going to sit there all cozy and comfy in your jacket and then nod off. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">There are really basic things that people are aware of. Of, how not to fall asleep. You know. Don't you think? Isn't it like I'm really asking am I being really harsh with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Is that what you're wondering?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You're wondering if what you're trying to assess your expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. Do you think I'm being harsh with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: I don't think you only have a question about that in this respect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: I think you wonder about that in so many different respects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">(Pause: [00:20:13 00:20:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I think you're very disappointed and angry with her in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And the point isn't lost on me and probably not on you, too, that you mentioned that this is a mother\/daughter pair that you went to and so I imagine that seeing that woman who is so motherly as someone's mother is also a whole story in itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I'm not trying to make it so much about that. I was aware, I am actually seeing that they are completely different and I should not equate me and my mom with them, you know. That they lead a different life from us so (Laugh). Yeah, I don't know. I mean yeah, I do see the motherly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">side of that woman and I've tried to kind of ignore it or resist it.

Like they wouldn't say a word to each other and he was very like, he was really like he would only be able to talk to intellectuals like he really just cultivated this side of himself and that really limited him socially and I sought that out but, of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200812\">course, because I wanted that. I wanted to grow intellectually but I also didn't want to like change my standards too much and I guess they did change, like he's become the standard, right?

So she and I moved to Ohio into an apartment and then Chris would visit from Cambridge on the weekends and then longer as he didn't need to be there as much and so he just kind of slowly moved in with us.

At one point he was like, 'oh, your mom doesn't have any <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">insurance. Let me get her on my insurance.' Like are you stupid?

But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: So he does it because you ask him to or he feels it should be done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: I think it's the latter because he knows I just don't like going to the bank and grocery stores so he (unclear) do that.
