They're going to call me later today to tell me what he pled to. They couldn't tell me at the time of I don't know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Will there be other people testifying, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don't know. They kept everything kind of in the dark, really. They want you not to see each other or know what's really going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I see. Just say your piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know if other people were there or not. And the courthouse there's lots of people there, so it's hard to tell who was there for what, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right. (Unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I'm just hoping that he isn't out because he pled because I really, really don't want to see him anymore. But so that's really what's been the past 24 hours or so has been the big thing for me. But I think it's settling down, quite a bit, so which is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: One of the reasons I think it's turning up a bit, at least, is one I am feeling a little bit better, but also I realized that I did ask my parents for some help for some things that I need a bit thing I need. I've been sleeping on their mattress that they bought back in 1989. When they got <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">rid of it, that kind of thing, because I've been dealing with it. And I originally was not going to buy anything new until I moved because I just did not want to pay to move a mattress. I was just going to get a new box spring mattress and sell it when I left here, get new when I moved. I started, after <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">having a lot of really more painful nights and I've tried everything. I'd buy those big, thick foam things you stick on top and I've tried all this stuff it doesn't work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">So I finally talked to my parents about the idea of having them help me with just the cost of a mattress, you know, and nothing too extravagant, something that I could sell when I moved so I could get a better one, a medical one. And they were pretty good about trying to help me with that, so. I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">need to influence the quality of sleep. I'm obviously sleeping a lot and waking up and all this other stuff and I just need to influence the quality of sleep right now and it isn't even a this point, you know, it's not for any other reason than trying to improve sleep conditions, (unclear) uncomfortable, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">or no other this or that, you know. Mike's been having, like it's been bothering him a little bit, too, so it's you know, it isn't just me. And yes, sleeping on something that's more than 25 years old is probably, it's past, it's time. But I do try not to, just in general, I just hate friends of mine <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B3\">who like have always looked to their parents to finance anything that they want in their lives and they just expect to make plans based on the fact that they can just do that. To me that just disturbs me so much to see (unclear) adults doing that I am sometimes unwilling to ask for things that I might <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B4\">really need because I don't want to become like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099840\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">I just don't want to be that kind of kid. I really I get a lot of pride out of being able to things myself. And part of it's the fact that I worked and did it on my own. Sometimes it's just like fix something and did it on my own, you know. It's a very strange, complicated thing. It isn't just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">not relying on anybody else. It's also sometimes like, 'well, I took apart my air conditioner. It was making a funny noise. I figured out that it was the compressor and it need to be better insulated, so I fixed that, that, and that and now it's fine.' I get a great sense of pleasure doing that kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">of stuff, too, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">I feel silly saying it. I do. I just like doing that kind of stuff. I wish there was more that I could do. Some things I can't physically do on my own any more. But when I can't, I don't mind teaching other people. Like teaching Mike the basics of electrical wiring from time to time because sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">depending upon how the wires in people's houses, it's also not tiny, it's usually a big, thick, extruded copper wire which is very stiff, very hard to bend. And so if I'm doing something with something like that I'll have him actually do the bending and I'll walk him through it like, 'well, this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">what you need to do.' Everyone says, 'you can just ground it by doing this.' No. We're going to do it the right way. That kind of stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">So I think that because of the fact that it's getting warmer and I'm feeling better even just to do that kind of stuff. It's very much a perpetuating thing for me if that makes sense. Like success breeds success which (unclear) better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: And I don't mind if I'm going to bed in pain, because I overdid it but just from the exhaustion of doing a job well done. But I feel like I'm finally getting enough the word success is really weird, but things enough good days to feel like I can take the steps I need to make the changes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">in my life that I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I hope, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What changed your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Well, actually one of the things I was going to talk to you about is that I'm going to try and find a doctor who understands a little bit more about my type of pain and going to be a little bit more open to the idea of trusting me to have a certain amount of pain medication such that not all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">the time, but when I need to, like to have something for break-through pain, that kind of thing. And it's very difficult to get a doctor like that so I was hoping that if need be, that you, if I could use you as a reference to speak to about this. But I'm not like a because I've been coming here a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">couple of years a couple of time a week but I'm not like a, you know, an active narcotics-seeking you know what I mean? That this is <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Sure, I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I've never earnestly talked about my pain. I very rarely do this kind of stuff. I don't know if you feel comfortable with that. I don't know if that is in the realm of what you can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. I'm perfectly comfortable doing that and am more than happy to do it. When you want me to talk, you just send an e-mail to he or she and I, indicating that it's okay for me to speak with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: And for us to speak with each other and they may want you to auto-sign so -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099840\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I was going to say, I don't know, but (unclear) they may want something written.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: The e-mail will do for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: But they may want something else. But you know, after that (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Okay. I don't know if I'll be able to do it here. I may have to go to another state. Ours is very funny about narcotics and I don't want to be that person who's going out of their way to do this but I want to be able to be really forthright and say, 'hey, this is what used to be things used <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">to like I do have depression for a lot of reasons, one of which being chronic pain. I have adequate support. I am doing this but I need to be able to, especially if I want to work, I'm going to try and basically line everything up with showing this is see I've been doing the (unclear) thing of showing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">how much I'm working like working out, but working with the trainer; have the trainer working with but sometimes to get to that point of being able to do that I need to be able to some days take pills you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yes. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: And I need to be able to have all my ducks in a line and say, 'hey, this is what I need but I need you to trust me enough to have -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: But this won't I have to do a lot more research because I don't know in the past it had been my primary care doctor who was a diagnostician who was perfectly okay with this. Now he's in jail though. So you know. And I want to be really forthright about that, too. Because I don't want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">seem like I'm hiding anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: My doctor is my old doctor and so I feel like he's my doctor even though I haven't seen him in a couple of years. I feel like he was persecuted, not because of narcotics either. Before he was put in jail he was very, very open about the fact that he believed that human growth hormone in certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">situations like is a viable way to get the kind of healing results that many (unclear). And it isn't illegal. They decided that he was like after a certain point, like they decided he must be because he was giving little (unclear) nuns for the hip replacements, giving growth hormones so that they would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">have better outcomes from their thing because he used to also be the doctor for the team, giving football players them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Which is not true, but they canned him and everything's been compounded against like I said, I don't know it's this is a person, my doctor. I grew up with him. I've known him since 1985. I don't believe it's in his, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: But I won't go on about that when I'm talking to this doctor, but I want to be as honest as possible because part of the reason why I had such good outcomes on these most people when they have joint replacement, it's a 10 to 15 year old [time bomb] (ph) before you need to get them redone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: But, it's getting better. But part of the reason why is because you never totally heal and you get these thin films of very, very low level infections and that tends to stay there. It's either a very, very low level you almost never get too much of an outbreak, but your body's ability it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">makes a little wall around it to make sure it doesn't spread because it never spreads, but that eventually, the byproducts of that breaks down the joint replacement. And so he worked very strongly with both my (unclear) surgeon and my doctor were sports medicine diagnostician people doing injectable <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">antibiotics. I had steroids not like steroids I take now, but I had human growth hormone. I had creatinine. I had all this stuff along with a really strong regimen even before surgery. They built up the triceps so that the weight because it's heavier. I mean these are break-through concepts. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200693\">when you hear it you go, 'of course you would want to build up the muscle there and it's heavier -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099840\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Nobody thinks to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: You don't do that. That's some of the reason why I mean they did (unclear) my marrow. But they say it looks like it was done last year. There's no wear. There's no wear at all, and that doesn't happen. I mean it does happen but this is statistically, that's not (unclear). And I've had two <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">of them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That's awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: That doesn't happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: And so I really feel like on some level maybe I just need to find myself a doctor and I'm not saying I have to leave, but I need to find someone new that really does understand and is compassionate and is willing to work with me. I'm willing to (unclear) with whatever evidence I need to do. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">I'm willing to work it, but I just need to make sure that I can get myself back to normal. I mean I'm (unclear) physical therapy and I'm coming home and more than a few time I've had to be taken home from physical therapy because getting up on the bus was too hard. Because it's hard. It's really hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">and I don't want to be like I don't want to I need to find some way to make it I just need the outcome to be better. I don't want to settle for any one of these. I'm willing I know that I will have to settle in life, I know. But right now I just feel like if I can get something in some healing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200753\">outcome or get myself better, every doctor I've had said, 'you know, you gained 100 lbs since you were originally diagnosed. If you lost even half of that you're disease would be significantly better because you wouldn't have the weight pressing on the joints that are already decaying. It's a lot like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200754\">a bridge that has trucks going over versus cars going over.' I know that, but you know what? It's when you're in agony it's almost impossible to do things you need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: You mean as far as exercise and things like that. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: And I'm willing to do I know it doesn't have to be narcotics. I mean if I can find something anything, I would go for it because I just I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I need to have a better life. You know? So, yep. I get like this every spring pretty much. It sounds stupid, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">but as far as getting this unsatis not in a bad way unsatisfied with my life, like, 'oh, I'm so sad that my life is this way,' but just like what can I do to (unclear) my life?' I guess, really. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">I decided to make the change with the bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: We'll see if this one works. You know, I spend a lot of time looking into that kind of thing and just see where it goes from there on, I guess just (pause). I don't mind putting the work in. I just and sometimes even the failure isn't that bad.

There are people in my life who have really, strongly pushed me to look into getting federal disability. I really, really don't want to and it's lots of reasons. The biggest thing is, is in my head. It keeps me from trying. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">I told you that the number one reason aside from the fact that it is very hard to get certain medications here, that I gave it up, was I found out up here that there's an opiate called Opana that I was taking. It was a sustained-release thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: They almost never give you that particular opiate instead of like Vicodin or whatever unless it's called palliative care up here. As soon as I saw that, I'm like, 'fuck that, I'm not palliative.' I mean that kept me out of being in the class of palliative care, it kept me out of being in certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">different drug trial, kept me out of doing this and for some reason I did not like in my head, that made me so angry that I stopped like that, you know, and maybe it's stupid to be like influenced so strongly by labels and things in life or like, perceptions, but I'd like to believe at least it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200892\">because I'm strong. I spent three years on daily narcotic therapy and I decided one day that I was just going to stop it and it wasn't pleasant, let me assure you of that. But it wasn't as (unclear) as I thought it would be. I was able to stop. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">I really thought that withdrawal, I mean, the first couple of days you're nose runs. All these like things that are like narcotic withdrawal, was probably the things but they weren't nearly as bad as I like imagined it from reading -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: what it would be like. Doctors never let me do that. They always want to take you down. And I was like I'm not taking this down. I'm just going to stop. I've done this with habits before and maybe it makes me extreme, I don't know. But it's part of it's just a personality part of me like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">saying I was on something, most of the time I really do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Um hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Before I just decided to give up being on long term narcotic palliative therapy, the biggest thing I had to claim from that was one day I decided I was going to stop biting my nails, so this one definitely sounds like a better habit to have broken, per se.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: But in terms of harder things to do, but it's something I'm really proud of, too, and I feel bad that I'm thinking of doing this again, but it's not the same thing. This is not going to be an everyday thing. This is not going to be an every week thing even. I see this as again, medicine to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">me better as opposed to again, if you I wouldn't want that the word \"palliative\" as opposed to like me in my head thinking that means that like keep me comfortable until you're dead, and really technically what it means -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: like if you look up what the word is, but that's what I perceived it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: It was technically true they're trying to keep me comfortable.

He had bench warrants out for him at this time I guess because there was some sort of, he was technically I thought he had an ankle brace as in like he was when I saw him in the house the first time because of the way his sock was. It was actually an ankle <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">monitor and on top of it so he was under house arrest. I don't know how you get to roam about the city in that way but hey, it was okay. And you know, but he also had warrants out for him because I guess, because one hand doesn't know what the other one is talking to in terms of that. So he had weapons. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB2\">He had not just had weapons, but also had been convicted in the past for using them in violent methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: That's pretty dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: And, you know, when he sat down with me on the bus, you know, I was scared as hell but I wasn't going to let him know I was scared when he came back on because we don't do that usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: It's a coin toss but at that point I didn't realize how bad it was. I just, you know. I thought to myself, as much as I'm terrified, if I let him know that now then he's going to be on that bus the same time every day of the week for the rest of my life or at least, you know? But if I pretend <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">like I don't even know he's there, then he's going to think, 'oh, wrong person, or you know, he's not interested in being intimidated,' I guess is the word. He either can't be intimidated, he doesn't recognize who I am, I may have been I basically went to different outcomes in terms of that. Of course, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B72\">if I acted scared you know it's you know but I'm not usually like I said, it's a coin toss. But it seems like at least things that really matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: I'm terrified of roller coasters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">(Pause): [00:22:39 00:22:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: That kind of thing.

Maybe it's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It kind of sounded a if you sort of anticipate that the other person, I mean, in a way I know you're probably not yourself, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: I don't know anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like you almost expect sort of to be jumped on in a way for what you're saying, or like you're going to be (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099840\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I actually am highly conditionable and so these kind of responses to certain things are usually due to something that has happened in the past. And so feeling like that is often because I am expecting it due to something else that has happened, you know. I am usually extremely na ve about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">the world and then somehow I get something happens and it's usually not just once, it's a couple of times and then I get very guarded towards that very specific set of things, like saying things like, 'oh, I'm this, or I'm that,' you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Or, it sounds like me saying this out loud, it is most likely because I am expecting because I have in the past having someone say, 'you know it sounds an awful lot like you're acting like a puffer fish right now saying how (unclear) you are hoping that you'll believe it too, but I don't, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">don't really feel like that, you know.

About this kind of stuff, like, saying that and then re-thinking things. A few days ago a bunch of friends of mine sent out a thing where everyone's supposed to answer questions about what you were like now and then what you were like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">at certain ages in your life and everybody can see each other's stuff and like compare all this stuff. And one of them was what you were afraid of like at age 14 and what you're afraid of now. And at age 14 I was afraid of and I literally said, 'nothing.' Nothing at all. And people were like you had <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB2\">to be afraid of something spiders or whatever. And I said, 'well, I'm sure that if someone put a gun to my head I'd probably be at that point afraid of dying.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: But I was afraid of nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: And it wasn't false sense of fear because at that age you're invincible, but it also was the fact that it wasn't just that, it was because of the fact that I really for so many years felt like there wasn't anything that I couldn't overcome given time and potential resources. So there was nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">to be afraid of. Like, you know, like I didn't have to be afraid of spiders because I would be able to know that I was living I would know to stay away from the type of spiders that would be dangerous. Now, I lived in Kentucky and I didn't actually pick up my old fear of spiders after living in Kentucky, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F32\">but that was a valid reason because they have spiders and other things that actually are dangerous, but I mostly would be reflecting about the fact that that's something for many, many years like well into my 20s I was afraid of very, very, very few things. And now I do all kinds of dumb ass shit because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F33\">I don't really feel like I'm dealing it isn't just that I don't feel like it but everything's driven by fear, by stupid things are driven by fear, irrational fear. I don't do or don't do things you know. I mean I'm not leaving my house or anything like that, but you know, I don't want the reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F34\">why I don't more invest as much time and energy into relationships is because I'm afraid of rejection. Like, into friends and things like that. I'm afraid of, I mean I'm (unclear) way to far in there because there's a lot of other things involved with that, too. But when in the end is being, I'm afraid <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F35\">of putting myself out there and getting hurt. I mean, like you said, I'm more complicated than that situation, but I mean a lot of things, like I learn to be afraid of stuff and -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099840\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">(Pause): [00:30:34 00:30:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: I used to kind of actually like being naively arrogant.

And sure, I probably would have done some things that were stupid. I think I've told you that I actually clocked a professional hockey player at a party. Yeah. Now, I'm not the kind of person that usually does that kind of thing. The reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">why it makes for a great story is because everyone knows me and knows I'm not the kind of person to go to a party and hit somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: So, like that's one poignant moment in my life is I'm making excuses for it right now. It's what makes it a fabulous story is that I'm not the kind of person.

I mean, yes, I kind of do. But yes. It was kind of more along the lines of not necessarily thinking through the decision and (unclear) consequences as much as I needed to. I was speaking about this with my friend, Tracy, when we were in Kentucky, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">she told me that she had that same feeling now, too, but it's a very different for her because she's a parent now and she owns a home and she has all this other stuff and so the fear is that her actions can reflect on many, many other people, people that she's responsible for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: And I told her, 'I envy that.' I wouldn't mind being like afraid of being brash because I need to make sure that I don't lose my job because I have to make sure I have children to feed, that would totally be okay with me. It's not the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: It's different stakes. But being able to be being that way because like due to the fact that I made this choice because I don't have other people to care for, it's not my it's not just me. It's not all about me. That's a different thing. I think I wouldn't feel cheated in a way if that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F1\">what it was. Not just because I want to have a family. It's actually different. If I just also just had like my dog around, and I make a decision not to like do this because it might hurt my dog, you know, like that's okay too, you know? I tend not to yell at the dog park at people who (unclear) if <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F2\">my dog is nearby. If I'm by myself, I will actually go up to them and tell them that they're not supposed to have their dog off the leash, or this and that, or about cleaning up after their animal. If my dog's with me, I don't do it because I don't want anything to happen to her. You know? That's the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F3\">same thing.
