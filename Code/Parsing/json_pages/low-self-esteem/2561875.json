I think people purchase <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">these courses, so it\u2019s (chuckles) kind of interesting that you can make money off of these things.  So that was a long day, but it was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: How do you feel working a long day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t worked like that in some years. I used to put in those kinds of days when we used to tour. You know \u2013 that was normal and I was a lot younger, but I wasn\u2019t dead. I was tired and I went to bed kind of quickly, but I did realize that I need to work. I need to get out of the house. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">need to have less idle time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to be isolated, which often happens when you don\u2019t work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or not isolated and maybe see your wife all day long and not have any time apart to actually make time together more meaningful. So that felt good. I think they want me to work on something else tomorrow, which is a surprise, but good; and then, of course, Friday. (scoffs) Friday is recording <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">interviews with the president and the vice president. And just on Monday I applied for a job. It\u2019s a program that\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve heard of it.  It will be good to have some face time like that. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Quite a network. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So between that and what I did yesterday, I\u2019m feeling like work would be nice (chuckles) and, perhaps, imminent, so I\u2019m feeling positive about the future. I don\u2019t know to what degree getting the letter off to my dad has contributed to that. I\u2019m sure it has a great deal, in fact, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">I got a letter back from him on Monday and I actually brought it. It\u2019s about nine pages, but I\u2019ll read it to you just because I think it closes a loop.  \u201cDear Bryce: In my e-mail I said I would wait to begin this letter, but I need to start today. I will probably finish back in Michigan. I must address <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">a number of questions\/issues. To begin with, how on earth have you been able to survive the pain from all these years? I did not say cope because, from your letter, you have not been able to cope until you hear some honest reflection from me on my part of the picture. I hope the results are of some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">help. It seems we have both been living in separate parallel universes \u2013 you in maintaining the face that never betrayed the depth and breadth of your pain and anger; and I, myself, involved in passage through therapy,\u201d which is a court-ordered therapy from when he was charged\/convicted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">\u201c. . .through the therapy, moving on from the collateral damage to my family. Truly it has not been a case of out of sight, out of mind.  It\u2019s a rare day over these past many years that I\u2019m not mindful of the shame and guilt for my past failures. For example, when I\u2019m asked why I sold out . . .\u201d After <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">my mom died, he sold their trailer. \u201c. . . I say something about not wanting to own property in Texas. That is true; but the rumor that the new ownership was about to do background checks on tenants really made up my mind, so I ran. I did not want my story to reach Texas. My friends [ ] (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">00:05:37) Maine, have been accepting and supportive. I\u2019m not so willing to depend on that from people that don\u2019t know me that well. I feel relatively safe here with Elaine.\u201d His new wife. \u201cBy the way, I told her my whole story the summer before we married.\u201d  I was there. He doesn\u2019t remember that. \u201cShe <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">initially called everything off until Hank and Jimmy . . .\u201d His two brothers. \u201c. . . went online to see what was there.\u201d This wasn\u2019t clear, but I found out he went online to see what a background check would find. \u201cShe had been understandably concerned about what her family\u2019s reaction might have been. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F4\">When my brothers found nothing, she agreed to proceed. I have found no purpose in showing her your letter. I have given her a general view of what you wrote. I shared nothing of your personal data. I have wondered often when someone in the family would confront me with their personal pain and fear regarding <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F5\">my sin. I did not expect it would be you. David, Ashley and William . . .\u201d William is my youngest brother who was adopted as [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:56). \u201c. . . were still at home and school then and I still wonder \u2013 have they ever talked with you?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">\u201cNow about you and Brandy, I\u2019m completely blindsided by this revelation.  I know she once accused you and me to mom, but I blew off the reference to you. I assumed she just wanted to get you into trouble for some reason. I had some concerns about one of the other boys because of her kittenish behavior <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">and going in and jumping into bed over in their room. Beyond that, I had no clue. Over the years I have learned that was not the only behavior that escaped attention on my watch. Where was I? Your comment on my parenting is hard to hear, but even harder to deny. The core of these letters began with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">your health. It\u2019s not clear that my own health is at stake if I can\u2019t accept your forgiveness and keep building my own.\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure, though, what that means. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">\u201cAs I think back to my therapy, a comment by my therapist stands out. Seeing that I was feeling pretty low about myself, she asked, \u2018Is that all you are \u2013 a sexual predator?\u2019 I had to back off and find other, more redeeming truths about me. It took some time, but it was a necessary process to allow <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">me to regain my place in the human race and move on. I am still in process and I hope you find a path to join me in healing. As I read and reread your renderings of your self-destructive behavior and the physical and emotional trauma that waits for you every morning, my guts tighten and I feel the need <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">to get up and walk away from the pages. My God, what can I do? It\u2019s too late to convince that nine-year-old baseball player that I give a damn about him. That you can write that you still love me now, despite the torture you\u2019ve endured, is very hard for me to get my head around. However, I do look forward <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">to seeing your loving acceptance of me, knowing that you can do so without deep-seated anger living under the surface.  In your last e-mail you mentioned me getting a new life.\u201d After a big earthquake [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:13) \u201cThat is good and I hope it includes moving away from the view of yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200234\">as irredeemably horrible, for no one is irredeemably anything. I refuse to accept that judgment of me or of you. I don\u2019t have any more, except to thank you for the love that allowed\/forced you to write to me. That letter is going into my shredder. I shall never forget the message. Love, Dad.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: What do you feel in reading it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: (pause)  You know, it was funny because I got the letter on Monday. Monday morning I kind of sensed it was coming that day and, sure enough, I got it. (pause) I was pleased to read it. It actually felt like I was, in some ways, healing as I read it. I called him that night \u2013 or a few hours later. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">We talked and I said that sometimes you just have to kind of stick your finger down your throat and vomit all the stuff out in order to start to feel better, and that\u2019s kind of what it felt like I was doing.  I don\u2019t think either one of us is expecting that this is just all over, but I think one other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">thing that concerned me when I wrote to him is how he could react at the age of 80 when I tell him and when I talk to him that (sniggers) one of my more recent deadline was the end of 2013; then it was his birthday; then it was I wanted to send it before July. I said I didn\u2019t want to wait until you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200273\">were experiencing dementia and have this be this completely either useless or irreparably damaging or somehow not the result I was meaning or looking for.  I felt good about it and I don\u2019t quite know what to make of his comment that he had no idea that I . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: Do you believe him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: I believe that he believes he had no idea. This is many years ago but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not the kind of thing you know and forget, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, because when he told me about it, it was after school and I came in and mom was doing dishes and she said, \u201cDad wants to talk to you. He\u2019s in the bedroom.\u201d I went in there and he was sitting on this ugly green couch that I remember quite well. He explained to me that he was being charged <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">with criminal sexual abuse and he said something like along the same lines of what you mentioned [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:46) because I had come clean at some point. (pause)  Just a few years ago I said something about my own involvement. (pause) I can\u2019t remember what it was, but he said something like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">\u201cWell mom said you did.\u201d It was something like that, but I do think I\u2019ve had more time to put my letter together. I suspect he might reflect more and come to a different understanding or memory of it.  I\u2019m not bothered by it but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Memory is also so constructive \u2013 what we remember, how we remember things. Our memories do change over time so, like you said, you can believe that he really believes that that\u2019s what he knows or doesn\u2019t know. He may really feel like he\u2019s telling the truth because that\u2019s his truth right now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">Eyewitness testimony is famous for stuff like that, where people can swear with 100% certainty what they saw, and they\u2019re not lying. That is their memory of what they saw because their memory . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Is not foolproof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not foolproof at all. It\u2019s actually remarkably bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. Barry tells me that a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s very [plastic,] (ph?) is a better way of saying it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: The point, I don\u2019t think, was . . . I don\u2019t feel like my effort was diminished or his responses fell short because of that. Just alerting him to it was, I think, really the point. How he deals with it now is up to him. It\u2019s really not my concern. (pause) It is kind of pointless to argue who <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">knew what when because I\u2019m not looking for some sort of \u201cyou were right; I was wrong\u201d kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You wanted him to know what your experience has been and he was able to take responsibility, having such an impact on you, and hear about what you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I think I have suffered in the past three or four years because of the distance that had grown between us and that, I feel like, is . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: You very much opened the door for real communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: And what he said to me on the phone was \u201cI had no idea that you were harboring anger towards me.\u201d  I didn\u2019t want to explain to him, \u201cWell, dad, when you call me and I don\u2019t take your calls and I call you back a few days later . . .\u201d (sniggers)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: He doesn\u2019t read that as anger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Just busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Or maybe that\u2019s what kids do these days. No one ever answers their phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s true. I felt good after I talked to him and (pause) it just feels good to get the poison out of the well. (pause) That\u2019s where I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a huge piece that you\u2019ve been working on that\u2019s been . . . enough of the process is over. You\u2019ve really opened the door to communication with him, which is another piece of the process. The burden you felt of writing the perfect letter to express \u2013 or the comprehensive letter to express <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">\u2013 all that needed to be said, was a really big burden. To be able to get it to a place where you felt comfortable sending it or comfortable enough sending it \u2013 I know it didn\u2019t feel completely comfortable to send it off, but that you were able to get it to a place where you were able to do that. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">you like to check off the boxes and this was a really big one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: It is. It is. Earlier today I was just cleaning up the desktop, the computer desktop, and I saw \u201cdad letter.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: How many versions were there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t found them all. (both laugh) The ones that were on the desktop were delete, delete, delete.  I didn\u2019t feel any need, because sometimes I\u2019m like \u201cwell, I better hold onto . . .\u201d At what point am I going to say, \u201cI told you this and here is the letter I have to prove it?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: You can let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. It feels great. Part of it, also, has to do with actually following through and getting it done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: Disproving the theory of yourself as somebody who never finishes things, this is a big piece of evidence in the other column. There are other ones, I think, that you don\u2019t acknowledge, but this one is going to be hard for me to let you forget about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, it is. (pause)  I think for me there is a concern about idle time and what I do with it. (pause) I\u2019m still working on how to structure it, how to organize it, what to squeeze out of it, what not to expect; and so building on these completions is something that I hope I can implement in moving <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">forward because, as you said a long time ago and you alluded to it just now \u2013 does the letter need to encapsulate everything I want to say and can it?  And no; so in many ways it is imperfect, as in incomplete. And can I accept that state with other things?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: To let yourself finish things and not have to have them be perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I do understand the (pause) (scoffs) deadfalls of perfectionism. I understand them cognitively and I\u2019m starting to understand them impractically and how they relate to my well-being and emotions.  (pause) So I do hope that I can kind of draw on this. This is a big one and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">know that there are going to be bigger ones than this. This one took me four years to do. (scoffs) Again, it wasn\u2019t like I was working on it every day, week, month or year, but that said . . .  Like you said before, something about just because you didn\u2019t write it down doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t work on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: It was in the back of your mind every month, day . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, working on it; seeing things through the lens of \u201cwhy did he do this? Why did he do that?\u201d has been helpful; so in some ways, letting it linger has also been a tool for development as well. I\u2019m not going to say \u201cwhat\u2019s the right amount of lingering?\u201d It certainly was productive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: Maybe whatever it was was the right amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. And understanding further the process of editing eventually you\u2019re more actual. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: The idea that what something is, is the way that\u2019s right or how it should be, all of those [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:23), there may be different lessons that you learn. Had you pushed yourself to send it sooner, would that have been an experience that taught you something valuable? Maybe. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">may have been a different learning experience than letting it process for the amount of time that you did. I don\u2019t know if there is one right way, but what was was right for you. You learned certain things from it and didn\u2019t learn other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. The letter I would have sent two years ago would have been very harsh and not contain any (sniggers) compassion or empathy therein. That was in the last letter. You\u2019re right. As you think about it, it\u2019s like how hard have I been on myself the past three years about not doing this? I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">there comes a point where you have to believe in yourself and that the right time will appear. That said, again going back to that concern about what I do with my idle time, am I avoiding something by saying that it\u2019s not the right time? Or am I actually working on it in subtle ways?  (pause) I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B2\">I need to just \u2013 about that concern about squandering my time \u2013 be wary of when I know I\u2019m wasting time. I think I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What is a waste of time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: (sniggers) It\u2019s not doing the Sunday Times crossword puzzle. That is a must do.  There are things I do that I do for myself. I have no guilt about doing them, but there are times when I sit there with my phone, wondering which social media I haven\u2019t checked for some sort of interesting thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">or contact \u2013 Linked In, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter \u2013 whatever. And I know I\u2019m wasting time. I don\u2019t really like it but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: So that doesn\u2019t feel good in the way that completing that crossword does. There is a big difference between recreation, which I think is a really important component of life . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Or just wasting time \u2013 what I would call wasting time. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know what else to call it. Maybe it is wasting time. Not wasting, but it certainly is misusing it because if it doesn\u2019t feel good, then why do it? It\u2019s not like okay, doing sit-ups might not feel good, but it\u2019s doing something positive for you. Scrolling through the social media sites <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">doesn\u2019t feel good and I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s good for your health either in the way that going to the gym has this obvious benefit to cardiovascular health. Social media hasn\u2019t proven that yet. It\u2019s actually proven that, for the majority of people, the longer they spend on those sites, the higher their <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200752\">levels of mental health distress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: I think I remember something about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, Zuckerberg (laughs) is a multi-millionaire. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: There are times when I think \u201cI\u2019m just going to delete this account.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: And I think one of the reasons I resist it is because I think, for me, a way to avoid certain behavior has been to just cut that out [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:25) thinking, for example. I don\u2019t want to have that be the only way I can deal with something. No Facebook \u2013 no Facebook problem. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Less idle time might be another way to do that \u2013 not all the time, but one of the things I\u2019ve heard you talk about is working on your own versus having a job that you go to from nine to five or eight to eight (laughs) . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Eight to nine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: That is very challenging for a lot of people because having to be your own taskmaster and create all the structure to yourself and be accountable to yourself, those are really hard things to do. There are issues with social isolation and lack of feedback. When we work with somebody else or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">when we work with other people, you\u2019re getting feedback. There is the social contact that you get. There is the structure of the time, even if it\u2019s not like \u2013 nobody clocks in anymore \u2013 but there is still the expectation that you\u2019re going to show up and have face time at some point during the day. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200852\">in a really challenging position where you\u2019re working on stuff on your own, but you\u2019re not accountable. There is a lot of freedom with the time, so you\u2019ve been challenging yourself to make really good use of your idle time, but you\u2019re doing it under the hardest circumstances possible \u2013 so much free space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: And the thing that I am responsible for is not really even applicable in this country (laughs). It\u2019s even more removed. I\u2019m hidden purposefully and, to an extent, detrimentally; but you\u2019re right and I think sometimes I wonder about it\u2019s been how many years since I actually held a job? It\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">a while. Prior to that, it had been since I was 14 I worked, at least, once a week where I showed up \u2013 at least. Since 16, probably more infrequent than that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: School even counts partly because \u2013 no? Not at all? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: (scoffs) Just kidding. No, it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: They may not be taking attendance, but there is that external pressure of showing up to class and handing in your paper.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: There has been that time and, I guess, when I think about it, as far as having a job and having a career and moving forward in something, I saw school as something of a lateral jump to something that was, for me \u2013 not necessarily a career or a developing move. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not as though <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">I wasn\u2019t even working then. I did have a job here for that part of the time, but I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that taking this time \u2013 however long it will be or is or has been \u2013 I don\u2019t need to feel bad about it. I don\u2019t need to feel bad that I\u2019m not learning lessons even from this downtime. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F2\">Everyone I work with is moving up and when I look back, when I worked with them, I was a different person. I was a much more emotionally fraught person.  I wonder how people dealt with me (sniggers), not that other people aren\u2019t, but for me to be able to take the time to work through these things and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F3\">have the space . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve been moving up in your personal development while they\u2019re moving up in their career.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I have to acknowledge that my health is buoyed by this and not stuck in some fearful shell that I think I used to live in. So idle time, as it is or as it has been, is not wasted.  But again, I think you\u2019re right as far as how do I want to spend it and what activities make me feel worse? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">What activities make me feel better? (pause) That, layered with the dangers of expectations and applying too many, layered with the belief that I don\u2019t need to produce something with every single activity I do, layered with the belief that I can finish something \u2013 all those things, all those layers, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200932\">are kind of like the opportunity that\u2019s in front of me is to have parsed out all those things with things I choose to do and the ways I choose to live.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: How hard is it to choose what you want to do? Do you have opportunities in front of you? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: In any moment you have lots of opportunities \u2013 pick up your guitar, scroll Facebook, go to the gym, work on your website. How hard do you find it to pick what you want to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: It depends on the day, but it can be really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What could make it easier on the hard days? (pause) Actually \u2013 erase that question. What makes it easier on the easier days? Maybe there are clues here that we could use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: There are. There are. I think the linchpin is that I actually feel like I\u2019m progressing \u2013 like this website. It\u2019s like what\u2019s the point? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: What is the point for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: The point is to have something I could actually point to and say that I did this and it\u2019s complete. It has everything I did when I was involved, things that are going to be visible to somebody. For example, interviews, perspectives [on putting up on this site] (ph?) that aren\u2019t really out there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">necessarily. (scoffs) Probably at the most basic level, it\u2019s to finish something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Those are all things to answer your own question: \u201c Here is why I work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: Sometimes I feel like there is no expectation. I don\u2019t have any expectations. I don\u2019t have any goals set for it.  I don\u2019t have anyone looking over my shoulder saying, \u201cHow is this coming?\u201d Even the value is somewhat questionable. I don\u2019t know if anybody is going to get into the habit. I hope, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A71\">but it\u2019s not a guarantee. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m doing it, but those days when it is easier is when I feel like . . . And it\u2019s like anything for me that when something lingers, like a song, for example, it just kind of sits back there. It\u2019s just kind of molding now. I\u2019m not sure you really want to touch <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A72\">it. I\u2019m not ready for it, but what am I going to do? I\u2019m stuck on it, I think \u2013 and with the website, even more. All the information on there is not as current as it was when I was updating it more frequently and I was jazzed about it.  I\u2019m not sure if that answers your question, but I think it does <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A73\">come down to whether I feel like what I\u2019m doing has meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It has value, meaning, and momentum, it sounds like \u2013 an early phase of starting a song. We feel like there is this momentum, the energy of a new idea in a website that makes it easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">CLIENT: (pause)  I guess as I think about gym, going to the gym. I might go this afternoon. I might go tonight. I don\u2019t know. I want to. I haven\u2019t been feeling well enough to do it in the past two-and-a-half weeks or been out of town or whatever, but I still know that I can do that and get back into <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB1\">it without thought or dread. (pause) I\u2019m still working through this song in my head that I recorded two weeks ago. They\u2019re a little fresher. I just spent a lot of time on my website Monday, so things are there. For me, I just want to be able to touch things a little more frequently.  I\u2019m trying to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB2\">out why it is that I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What gets in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. It doesn\u2019t keep me up at night, but that\u2019s not how I want to live. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: When you said you wanted to sort of touch these things or delve into each of them, what are you doing when you\u2019re not doing that? What gets in the way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: Facebook is the problem. (chuckling) I think I get down and I say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to do that. What\u2019s the point of doing that? I\u2019m not getting paid to do it and no one is going to know it\u2019s me. My name isn\u2019t on the website, so I don\u2019t have to.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And \u201cit\u2019s important to me to finish\u201d doesn\u2019t come up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, it doesn\u2019t, but there is this vague assumption that I will finish it someday, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">THERAPIST: But spending today doing this won\u2019t get in the way that much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">CLIENT: Exactly. Or doing this until something else is depressing, like having dinner. \u201cAh, I\u2019ve got to do that.\u201d I have an out. But I know that even having that out doesn\u2019t necessarily exonerate me. I still feel like I\u2019ve wasted time, that I would feel better if I had chosen other activities; and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB1\">the key.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And that you deserve to feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.  (pause) Here is what I\u2019m thinking: I would like to, if you can do this, every other week. Is that possible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: Okay. I don\u2019t want to throw a wrench into your schedule, but if you have someone else who is coming in every other week, I could try to offset it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">THERAPIST: You can keep your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">CLIENT: Okay. I\u2019m flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Keep your normal time. What is the impetus to moving to every other week? I\u2019m going to let you do it, I just want to hear your process.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561875\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: I feel like, in some ways, I want to spend a little time talking to myself and reflecting on things that I can do at home.  I think I come in here and I do those things, but I think I want to try to put some of these things into practice. I also have a [DBT] (ph?) group coming up, starting in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB1\">a couple of weeks. That wasn\u2019t part of my thinking about this, though. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll stay at every other week, but I want to give it a try for a few weeks just to see how it is. (pause) Just test the waters, in a way, and decide if it\u2019s working for me. If it\u2019s not working, I want to come back <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB2\">to weekly, if that\u2019s all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that sounds really reasonable. Do the experiment to see how that goes for you and what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working. Do what works best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s certainly not like I\u2019m doing it for financial reasons, but I\u2019m looking forward to (both chuckle) having to pay less frequently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Sounds like a plan. Let\u2019s check days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">CLIENT: If you have a pen over there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">THERAPIST: What color would you like, Bryce?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: Orange. (chuckles) Any color you choose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Learn to live with disappointment because that was one of the few colors I don\u2019t have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: An exercise in tolerating frustration. Today is Wednesday. Let\u2019s do Friday, the 9th, because that\u2019s like a week-and-a-half.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">THERAPIST: There is a week in summer that I\u2019m out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">CLIENT: There is one for me, too. It\u2019s late June.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m going to be gone August 1st. I feel like there is a sooner one than that, but it\u2019s not in my calendar. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">CLIENT: Definitely the 27th of June I will not be here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Would that fall on \u2013 it would? Okay. No, because we would be the 6th and then the 20th, if we\u2019re doing every other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: But the 27th is the date that I can\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: If we stick with every other, we wouldn\u2019t be on the 27th. We would be on the 6th and the 20th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t do the 4th of July either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: We can deal with July. If you want to pick another day that week, we can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: The 6th and 20th. The 23rd, 9th. Okay, great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
