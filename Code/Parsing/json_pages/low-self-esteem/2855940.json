Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s on your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I guess a few things. Overall, things have been going pretty well and we had a productive, helpful couple of sessions last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Some things are going really well. I spent most of Saturday with my friends and that was nice. Ivan, in fact, went over with me and hung out with them.  My really good girlfriend from grad school\u2019s boyfriend lives with her, and he and Ivan got together to play games and one of their other friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">joined, so that was good for him. Thursday and Friday, Ivan was having a pretty rough time saying he felt really down and he felt like he was thinking about hurting himself and just felt really disappointed in himself. Thursday, that took kind of a different shape that was difficult for me to respond <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">to, but good maybe. A lot of times, Ivan has slept most of the day or coped in different ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: When he\u2019s feeling like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: But on Thursday, he went to the gym, he watched a couple of documentaries, he got out. It sounds bizarre and is bizarre, but his uncle has wire to make chain mail, something to do with your hands.  He did that and that\u2019s kind of how he spent a good portion of the day while I was away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: A much healthier coping method than sleeping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t know if I did a great job of responding to that because, on the one hand, I told him it sounded like a much better way to cope than curling up and sleeping all day. On the other hand, I felt a little frustrated because I had a super long day on Thursday. I was gone for over 13 hours. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">The one thing Ivan was supposed to be doing this week was faxing his loan forms because he got behind on renewing his payment plan and has been making payments, so he really needed to do that and he didn\u2019t do it on Thursday because he did these other things. It was tough because I wanted to be encouraging <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">that he found more adaptive or healthy ways to deal with feeling like that during the day.  But on the other hand, I felt like that was a long day, a long time that he had and I didn\u2019t quite know how to find room to also say, \u201cI get that and it sounds like it was tough and you dealt with it well. At <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">the same time, you still really need to take care of this one thing that\u2019s been put off for a really long time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: How about that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Because I kind of said that to some extent. Ivan knows that to some extent. It\u2019s just hard because, maybe it\u2019s just my perception, but it feels like if I say anything negative about him just taking the day to relax and do fun things and go to the gym and do all these really great <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">things \u2013 that sounds like a good day, in general, and a good way to cope \u2013 it feels like I\u2019m saying how dare you relax? You are so overdue on this form that you\u2019ve got to do this.  I don\u2019t want to do that and I\u2019ve told Ivan I don\u2019t want to actually talk about his form with him at all. It\u2019s his form <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">and he should just be doing it. I don\u2019t want to slip back into the pattern where I mom him and he resents it and both of us are angry and it\u2019s still not done. On Friday, I got home and he was kind of down. I asked if he had faxed the form and he was like, \u201cThey asked me to stay late at work. I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">needed to stay late to do the deposits, but I did call.\u201d He showed me his phone and he called at like 4:15 or 4:30. Eventually, what came out was because I had said, \u201cWait a minute. I thought you said you called them the other days and it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re here.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell . . .\u201d Eventually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200274\">he came forward and I tried to tell him it\u2019s always better to tell me the truth and we\u2019ll deal with it, rather than avoiding it or hiding it.  That\u2019s always going to be a worse outcome, no matter what the truth is. He was like, \u201cWell, I did call. When I told you that I called a couple of times earlier <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200275\">in the week, I really did, but I got put on hold,\u201d which is what happens when you call a loan company. You do get put on hold. It\u2019s a painful process. He was like, \u201cI hung up because I was seventh in line.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, there is a very big difference between saying \u2018I called.\u2019\u201d Obviously the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200276\">person would believe that you spoke to someone and actually had a call versus saying I called and, basically, you dialed. (scoffs) So I told him that I was really glad that he told me the truth. I tried to go back over our steps. I was really glad that you told me the truth, that I really appreciated <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200277\">that, that I understood that it was difficult.  I have spent a very long time on the phone with a loan \u2013 it\u2019s very aggravating that you do have to wait a long time; that I sympathized. Then I also did just say, \u201cBut I\u2019m really disappointed that you lied because I would have much rather that you had <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200278\">told me. Even the day it happened, instead of just saying \u2018I called,\u2019 just tell me.\u201d \u201cRight. I know I can\u2019t just hang up, but that\u2019s what I did.\u201d So we talked about that and I told him that I sensed that there was maybe more and he was staring at the floor and, obviously, struggling. Eventually he said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200279\">\u201cI lied. I wasn\u2019t asked to stay late. I volunteered to stay late. I found myself feeling really, really down and I was thinking of hurting myself so I called my dad from the store and he said that I should stay with people and do whatever I needed to do to feel a little better; so I volunteered to stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002710\">late.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: And you were still working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I was at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You weren\u2019t at home anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny that he would like about that. That\u2019s a really adaptive thing he did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I even said, \u201cYou could have called me at work.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to worry you. I didn\u2019t want to make a problem for you and for you to be disappointed. I didn\u2019t want to bother you at work.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s true. Maybe I don\u2019t know. It depends on the day. I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">necessarily drop everything and leave or drop everything and spend a lot of time on the phone, but I could have at least suggested that you stay late at work or I could have \u2013 anything.\u201d I think he\u2019s definitely doing some things that are a lot more healthy to cope with it, but I am sad that he\u2019s still <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">feeling that down sometimes.  Ironically, it\u2019s just kind of hard because the things that he\u2019s feeling down about seem to largely be he realized the loans were pretty disappointing. He\u2019s put it off for so long that they started withdrawing from his account a huge amount because he just didn\u2019t do the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">income-based repayment plan; so they will just eventually start charging you. He was overdrawn on his account. It\u2019s hard because I think he feels really terrible about that and he feels really down about it. But then it\u2019s hard because it kind of feeds itself maybe? I will say I gave him a lot of credit <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200334\">then on Friday because I sat with him and hugged him and just put my arms around him. I told him I loved him. I told him I was really sorry that he was having such a rough day and feeling so down, but that maybe he should just shoot Dr. Bourd an e-mail telling him he\u2019s feeling really down, even if it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200335\">not going to do anything until he sees him on Tuesday. Just to be able to do that.  I was really proud because after that, I sat with him for a while and then after that he was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go online and do some of this form and get some of the numbers from our tax return.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: So he really did Friday and I even offered \u2013 we didn\u2019t do our taxes yet, but we have most of our forms. \u201cDo you want me to sit down? We can do the numbers like we did last year.\u201d He was like, \u201cNo, this is really my responsibility. If I need this number for my form, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d I was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">impressed. I eventually fell asleep in the chair (chuckles) in the living room and when I woke up, he had come back from printing off more of his form and preparing it and he brought pizza home.  It was later in the evening, but we were going to have a date on Friday and then it kind of got taken over <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">by him finally doing some of this. But that was really nice. To my knowledge, he finished the form over the weekend and now he is going to fax it and that\u2019s great. It\u2019s just hard because I want to really, really acknowledge when he is making huge changes like going to the gym and doing that type of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200373\">stuff, as opposed to sleeping all day. That\u2019s really huge, but I guess I don\u2019t want to always be looking for a place to critique or always be critiquing, but I also want a place to say, \u201cIf you feel really down about doing the form or if not doing it is causing consequences like you being overdrawn, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200374\">this really needs to happen; and I\u2019m disappointed that you lied.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: And yet, Ramona, the way you\u2019re describing it to me \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if this is how you were feeling it and expressing it to him in the heat of the moment \u2013 but you really sound like you genuinely feel both sides. In other words, a year ago, in the beginning of our starting to work together, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">what I think would have happened in this kind of circumstance is that you might have known intellectually \u201cI should make sure he knows I\u2019m happy he did not fall asleep all day.\u201d But the thing that would have been most alive for you emotionally would have been rage and frustration and disappointment, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">so that the thing that he would feel from you is that. The way you\u2019re talking about it right now, it just doesn\u2019t feel that way. I feel that you feel disappointed and that you are frustrated, but I don\u2019t feel like as you\u2019re talking about it, that that is the only thing you\u2019re feeling. I think you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200393\">also feeling excited and proud of him that he would pick some of these more adaptive things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You actually feel that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really huge. It\u2019s a big, big, big change for Ivan and I, at least, feel good about the part of me that was able to do that. \u201cThank you for telling me the truth. I want you to keep understanding that whatever it is, it\u2019s always going to work out better if you just come to me and tell me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">the truth and then we work on it and deal with it together.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a big, big, big change for you. It\u2019s not just that you\u2019re saying that and giving lip service, Ramona. You sound like you get it and you feel it. You do know it\u2019s so much better that he told you the truth. You do know that what he did was so much better than sleeping, and that\u2019s enormous <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">for him and you can also feel really disappointed that he still didn\u2019t get to the form. And you can say to him, Ivan, this is a place where it becomes a self-fulfilling snowballing prophesy because if you just get to that form, the very thing that\u2019s creating you feeling down would go away.\u201d  I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">hear you holding the complexity of his action and not just seeing it as black or white. If I see that and feel that, I\u2019m absolutely imagining he must, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: I hope so. I do wonder. I say how I really appreciate it and I\u2019m glad that he told me the truth and I understand that he\u2019s having such a tough time and I\u2019m sorry that he\u2019s feeling that way and, of course, I want to be there to support and encourage him doing healthy things for it and getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">help for it. And then following it with \u201cI am disappointed that you lied to me. I wish you would have told me the truth in the beginning.\u201d Or even, \u201cI am disappointed that it\u2019s not done yet. It really needs to get done.\u201d What I said to him last night was, \u201cHow do you want to take care of dealing with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">it? Because I don\u2019t want us to get back into that cycle.\u201d  It feels good for me. I don\u2019t know how it feels for him to still hear the \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d but for me I feel a lot better about saying it crystal clear; just \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed that it doesn\u2019t happen\u201d versus getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200433\">really angry or expressing inappropriate criticism. And I don\u2019t feel like I need to when it\u2019s so clear. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m really disappointed in that. It\u2019s not a big, drawn out thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s another way of putting it, I think. You\u2019re also not as drawn deeply into a kind of [transfer instinct] (ph?) towards Ivan, where he is your parents disappointing you once again exactly, so that the only thing you can see is red towards him.  You\u2019re holding onto who he is as Ivan, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">which is actually really disappointing, in some ways, and making huge changes that are really hard for people to make and some people go through their whole lives without making. I think you\u2019re seeing him more just for him, with his complexity. The reason I think he must hear this change in you is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">he responded by doing his forms. In other words, it isn\u2019t good for him or you if the only thing you did was cheerlead the changes he made. That\u2019s what his parents have done and it actually has not served him at all to have no one saying \u201cawesome on these fronts; here are the parts you still need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200453\">work on.\u201d Right? They never did that part for him and it has destroyed his capacity to face difficult things. It\u2019s known that he\u2019s become extremely avoidant and you\u2019re trying to say \u201cI\u2019m not going to avoid the fact that this is still here, but I\u2019m also not going to trash you because of the fact this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200454\">is still here,\u201d because there is so much more going on than just that, too.  I think the fact that you held compassionately and lovingly both sides \u2013 even the criticism was held with love. The way you\u2019re saying it right now is really very constructive. You\u2019re trying to say, \u201cHere is my reaction to it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200455\">and I really think [that we\u2019re seeing a good step] (ph?) to get to this; and me, too. I\u2019m in this, too. It\u2019s our money.\u201d He goes and does it \u2013 on his own, without being mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">CLIENT: No, he is making a lot of big changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">THERAPIST: And so are you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">CLIENT: I hope so. The fact that he did fun stuff or the gym \u2013 that\u2019s not necessarily fun \u2013 but he did that type of stuff instead of sleeping, I realize part of my reaction was, \u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ve been working. I worked a long day today and you\u2019re doing this.\u201d  But then the other part of it was that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">it did feel different, what he actually did during the day. Even though he didn\u2019t do the form, it was different than sleeping all day and I was reminded of . . . I guess with my mom it could sometimes feel really, really tough because I would be really angry if I was the one doing all the work and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">would usually spend the day in bed or spend the whole day in her PJs or whatever; because at some point you get angry, even if it\u2019s genuine that your parent has depression and really doesn\u2019t feel like seeing anyone or doing anything. You feel some compassion around that, but I guess to a point, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B3\">most of my growing up I didn\u2019t understand what depression was and that it was a legitimate thing because she would never speak about it or acknowledge that it wasn\u2019t just \u201cI don\u2019t feel like doing anything.\u201d  It was a lot more serious than that. I guess that\u2019s how it would feel or look to me as a child. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B4\">It would feel like \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. I just know I\u2019m doing all the stuff and my mom is in bed.\u201d It makes me angry eventually. I told Ivan I think I\u2019ve been triggered by that sometimes because it doesn\u2019t sound compassionate, but I guess I don\u2019t like the way my mom\u2019s depression has affected <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B5\">me or her. Of course, I don\u2019t like seeing her live that lifestyle, but I also have hated a lot of the impacts it has made on me and I wish, again, when I think of it, it seems very non-compassionate, but I wish she wasn\u2019t.  I wish she wasn\u2019t depressed. I\u2019m kind of angry, but it\u2019s taken that form. A <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B6\">lot of times I wish that Ivan wasn\u2019t or I wish I never was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re hard on yourself. You keep saying \u201cI know this isn\u2019t compassionate, but I wish she weren\u2019t depressed or she did get out of bed.\u201d I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s not a compassionate thing to say, Ramona. It would have been good for her and you if she got out of bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">CLIENT: I know, but it\u2019s just hard sometimes because (pause) I guess it\u2019s hard to say I\u2019m really worried about someone for having this medical condition, mental health state. I\u2019m really compassionate and worried and supportive, but at the same time I hate everything about it because it affects me in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">such a way.  Even in my mind I could draw an analogy to if both your legs were in casts and you had to lay in bed all the time, your significant other or your family wouldn\u2019t be angry that you had both your legs in casts, but they could eventually be angry that they picked up all the slack and did all <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">your stuff for you. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair or not, but I definitely felt that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it doesn\u2019t just break down like that. Here\u2019s what I want to say about it: if both your legs were in casts, they would eventually heal, right? And it\u2019s time-limited. If she had a severe form of diabetes and, therefore, couldn\u2019t move around much and she would get very hypoglycemic <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">very quickly, so she sat.  Yes, it\u2019s a medical issue, but there are things you can do to help it so that you can live a more functional life. Do you know what I mean? The same goes for any mental illness, including schizophrenia, a very, very 100% biological condition. You can go get treatment if it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200512\">is so interfering that you can\u2019t take care of your children or your home. For medical issues, for mental health issues, there are things you can do to help yourself and to make it better and there are ways of not doing anything so that it stays exactly the same. In other words, let\u2019s say the cast example <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200513\">and you do have to have your family, for the time being, pick up the slack because, even if it\u2019s six months or three months, even, you\u2019re in casts. If your mother were then saying, \u201cRamona, I so realize you guys are having to do more. I can\u2019t do my share and I\u2019m sorry for that.  Let\u2019s see what I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200514\">do from a sitting position. Maybe there are things I can help out with that are stationary activities.\u201d So she was demonstrating an awareness of what she wasn\u2019t able to do and knew she was going to physical therapy to help get her legs healed as quickly as possible; you would have such a different experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">CLIENT: I know, but it\u2019s really, really, really hard to approach. At least for me, it\u2019s been really hard to approach her about any feeling, any impact that it\u2019s had on me. Really hard to approach her about her getting any type of help or support, even if it\u2019s completely well intentioned, even if it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">as small as seeing a neighbor down the street so that she\u2019s not completely isolated all the time. It\u2019s not well received. It\u2019s received as a criticism. It does not go well and it\u2019s really difficult because I think a part of being depressed is not even wanting to get help, necessarily.  That can be a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200532\">part of it, so it\u2019s just really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:12) A lot of people with depression seek help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t; I\u2019m just saying sometimes for me . . . It seems to clearly be for my mom. It can affect motivation and can affect something as simple as finally picking up the phone and going and doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but look what you\u2019ve done with your depression. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: I had help. My mom actually took me to my first appointment ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You got yourself here. You got yourself to Dr. Paulaner?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not trying to make Ivan all about my mom, but I just think sometimes I\u2019m aware that I can be reactive towards that because that would be scary.  I can be reactive, in my mind. I didn\u2019t get really upset with Ivan, but in my mind I did get scared that he lied, even though he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">technically called. But he knew as well as I did that that was a half-truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">THERAPIST: I know that it seems like it\u2019s splitting hairs, but it\u2019s a little bit important that it was actually not a lie. It\u2019s misleading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s intentionally misleading. It\u2019s dishonest. It is different from saying he called and not having called at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">THERAPIST: As far as the range of offenses, it\u2019s a little bit less than having overtly lied that he did something that he actually didn\u2019t do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">CLIENT: It is, and it\u2019s not a big betrayal and it\u2019s not even something that I would categorize as \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s not okay, but within a marriage of what you\u2019ve tried to describe as normal disappointments that will happen inevitably, I could live.  I could live with something that small. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">I\u2019m not saying I should or I want to or that it\u2019s okay for Ivan to lie in any capacity, but it does trigger a little bit the emotions from the other lies; but I am aware that it\u2019s not the same and that he\u2019s working on it and that it\u2019s not a linear change. Anyway, that process that we went through felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200672\">good. Sunday he was pretty organized. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to church. I really want us to do that.\u201d And that was great. We had lunch together. He went over and played video games with the guys and then we had dinner together and we had our scheduled conversation. In the afternoon, we had spent some time <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200673\">sitting together before he was getting ready to leave and it was nice.  I asked him how he would feel about kissing for a little while, and it was really nice. And then in our conversation in the evening, he said, \u201cI feel bad. I worry that even if you\u2019re initiating or that you\u2019re agreeing, I feel a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200674\">little like you\u2019re just doing it because you think it\u2019s important to me or that I need it or you\u2019re worried what I will do if you don\u2019t.\u201d That felt like a really important conversation and we got into it some and I admitted to him that it could be scary for me and that I actually do worry, to some extent, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200675\">if I don\u2019t do certain things, what will happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">THERAPIST: One of the things you can say to him [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:48) that side of it is your responsibility. For example, if you are doing it because you\u2019re only agreeing to it or only initiating because you\u2019re worried, that\u2019s not his problem as much, Ramona.  That\u2019s actually your choice and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">your thing to work on, then, here with me; and he doesn\u2019t have to feel guilty for your choices. That\u2019s your part. So to just be able to say, \u201cIf I do that, Ivan, I\u2019m going to work on that and I\u2019ll talk to you about it, but it\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s what I\u2019m bringing to the table then. It\u2019s not your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200692\">responsibility to take care of that part of things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">CLIENT: He has expressed that he feels really bad for wanting that, for expressing any interest in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Why? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">CLIENT: I told him I think we\u2019ve both had some negative experiences, but that he does never have to feel guilty or ashamed or embarrassed or like he\u2019s done something wrong or immoral because he wants physical contact with me.  That\u2019s actually really healthy and it could be a really great, healthy part <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">of our relationship and I\u2019d like us to work towards that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20071\">THERAPIST: How about in you, Ramona? Your own guilt; your own discomfort?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">CLIENT: I think part of it comes from . . . I don\u2019t know. I guess I don\u2019t know, but I know I grew up with absolutely zero discussion about physical intimacy. Emma and I came from the stork, (scoffs) which is absolutely just none; which is bizarre considering my dad is a veterinary surgeon and my mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200731\">was a nurse. I was never comfortable discussing anything like that, very conservative, conservative people. I\u2019m sure they grew up never discussing it either, but it was never discussed until the affair and then I learned and heard more about the affair than I ever would have wanted to know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s the first time that the idea of sexual context came into your relationship with your parents with words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">CLIENT: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">THERAPIST: Ahh. Which is really difficult. Think about the first time it gets acknowledged is in a context where it actually is something that was destructive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">CLIENT: Right. It is immoral. It is something you feel guilty and ashamed about. It is disgusting. It is destructive. It is this horrible, horrible thing. Then I also grew up watching my mom sleep in different rooms of the house and refused to sleep in the bedroom with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Anyway? Before the affair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. On different occasions, she would sleep on the couch. That was a long period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">THERAPIST: How come? Because they were fighting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t know all the details, but I know sometimes he would try to bargain and try to get her to sleep in the bed again and they would have discussions about that, arguments about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">THERAPIST: You would hear these conversations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, I heard some. (chuckles)  Obviously, when she was sleeping in the den, library, sleeping on the couch, sleeping in other places, I guess it didn\u2019t occur to me to worry. My parents don\u2019t sleep together; something is really wrong. I knew things were wrong with the relationship, but it also <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200871\">never occurred to me that that part was healthy or important or completely without guilt or shame. And it didn\u2019t help that I, I guess, was that type of person who would sit in the back of health class and be like none of this really matters to me and I\u2019m not planning on having sex for years. I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200872\">interested. Some of my other girlfriends would do that, too. We were in high school and we weren\u2019t planning on having sex in high school, which might be unusual today, but I had no interest. So I obviously didn\u2019t discuss it with my friends. Same thing in college. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">THERAPIST: How about if we forget sex, formal sex for a time? What about other parts of boys, crushes, kissing \u2013 did that come up in friendships or with your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">CLIENT: In my friendships, yes. I had boyfriends and we would make out and that was fine and good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:16) And that was good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">THERAPIST: That didn\u2019t feel like you were doing something wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">CLIENT: Sometimes it did. Sometimes it did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">THERAPIST: But sometimes it didn\u2019t \u2013 or it always did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">CLIENT: It always felt like something to be just a little embarrassed about or guilty about or something very private that you wouldn\u2019t acknowledge in public necessarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s so sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B\">CLIENT: It is what it is, but I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t know as I ever saw it as something that could be really embraced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think if it\u2019s a taboo subject for a really long time and it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t even be crossing your mind and shouldn\u2019t even be something you discuss, let alone do, obviously, you don\u2019t flip a switch when you get married and it\u2019s now this wonderful, healthy thing that we <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F1\">can do.  It doesn\u2019t. And then Ivan and I had a pretty strange experience on our honeymoon and we just never really, I guess, had gotten good at incorporating that into our marriage. Part of it could be just natural. When we were dating we would date, even if it was renting a movie. We would naturally <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F2\">end up making out or kissing or holding hands or snuggling or whatever. But it would stem from having a positive experience, getting to talk a lot and, also, the absence of all the responsibilities that now we share.  So when we were dating, we never would have argued about Ivan\u2019s loan form. So many <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F3\">of these things just wouldn\u2019t have ever been on the radar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And in the beginning \u2013 dating and making out on the couch \u2013 even though there might have been a slight voice of this being something not to talk about or that has some uncertain feelings about it, did it feel good? Would you enjoy it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">THERAPIST: It didn\u2019t feel like it was what you were supposed to be doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">CLIENT: No. It didn\u2019t feel like an obligation. No. It was mutual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">THERAPIST: How far did it go physically before sex? In other words, before getting married? Was it only making out? Did you ever take your clothes off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">CLIENT: (laughs) No, we never took our clothes off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">THERAPIST: All the bases \u2013 touching each other\u2019s bodies? No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">CLIENT: Ivan would touch my breasts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">THERAPIST: On the inside?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">CLIENT: Sometimes. Actually, did that ever happen? I guess very, very, very rarely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">THERAPIST: How was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">CLIENT: It was nice. It was great. I mean, Ivan and I have enjoyed having physical contact with each other. It didn\u2019t go further than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really important, even going back to that point, because that\u2019s the start of sexual intimacy, right? Kissing, touching breasts, just touching alone before you\u2019re getting to [ ] (inaudible at 00:34:30). Up to that point, you were both experiencing it as a fun thing to do. It felt good, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B91\">right? So something about bringing in intercourse or that somehow it turns uncomfortable or was there a point after your [ ], which I know was really difficult, then in the next year did it get better? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">CLIENT: It didn\u2019t, and I always hoped that it could. But then with the stress \u2013 in that winter, Ivan stopped his construction job and started his restaurant job. And then there was a period where he didn\u2019t have a job and wasn\u2019t working 40 hours a week, wasn\u2019t helping with the stuff around the apartment; <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB1\">and then eventually finding out about seminary and it just felt like so much was going on. I\u2019ve never figured out how to \u2013 I guess now I\u2019m starting to \u2013 but how to integrate something like . . . I don\u2019t know. It always felt like having physical intimacy or even agreeing to a date or suggesting something <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB2\">like that would have been pretty much saying, not that it\u2019s black and white, but yeah oh, you just told me you lied about grad school for years? Oh, okay. Let\u2019s go . . .  That just never would have worked and we might now be at a place where I hope it\u2019s all in our past and we can keep talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB3\">it and working on it, but that we can also keep moving forward. I\u2019m not completely sure. Something I\u2019ve talked about with Ivan was that I would really like for him to be able to sleep in the bed and that would be great. But I\u2019m also really scared. I don\u2019t want that to happen again, so what do we do? <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB4\">Does he even think of something with Dr. Bourd If he starts to feel that again, does he get up and walk around? Does he go write about it in his journal? Does he go sleep on the couch for the rest of the night? What do we do just so that doesn\u2019t happen again? Something I guess I wanted to ask you: it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB5\">is bizarre, probably.  What would happen if Ivan and I continue to do what we did before it happened the last time and continue to build up having positive time and build up levels of having some physical contact? What would happen if then we continued having more physical contact or even started having <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB6\">sex again? Would Ivan still feel tempted to do that? Or does it come out of almost a desperation that he\u2019s ashamed of, like he\u2019s ashamed of even wanting or thinking about wanting that or halfway about it and it\u2019s really, truly never happening? If that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s my fault or <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB7\">his fault . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a good question because I hope I can respond in a way that I\u2019m going to convey what I\u2019m thinking.  If you were to reach the point in your relationship where the two of you were having regular sexual intimate contact that you were both enjoying and felt healthy and integrated, even alongside <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD1\">being annoyed at each other for things and disappointed in each other for things, but having enough positive that it feels like sex is something that you want to do with each other part of the time, I would think that the part of him that was doing it the way it\u2019s come out, in a more assaultive way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD2\">that would have already been taken care of anyway. How do I explain this? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that okay, Ramona, if you finally get comfortable and you say, \u201cOkay, we can have sex twice a week\u201d or something, that that means that it\u2019s all in your court to change this part of him. I think it\u2019s as <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD3\">much if not more his responsibility that there is something in him that is conflicted about getting to have a good sexual relationship with you.  That has nothing to do with you. You can be saying yes and doing it and if he still feels like \u201cI\u2019m bad. This is bad for me to want.\u201d That part of him would <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD4\">still make him avoidant of doing it in the aboveground way, whether you want it or not. So that\u2019s the part that I think is more actually more important for both of you is how you keep working individually on understanding why this got such a bad rap and how to continue and allow this to feel like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD5\">really good thing that couples share with each other that is just a further, the most intimate extension of feeling close to someone. It\u2019s sharing your bodies. It\u2019s as close as you can get and shouldn\u2019t be happening if you\u2019re not feeling close and all there is, is anger, but if there are moments of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD6\">a close, intimate evening that land in getting even closer like that.  So that\u2019s what I think is the thing that is probably generating it, more than just simply saying . . . I guess I\u2019m just trying to say to you it\u2019s not just \u201coh, if he would only come around, then he would stop doing that.\u201d Do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD7\">know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I\u2019m trying to continually think of how to move forward and move towards that. I think maybe it\u2019s something that he and I should discuss with Dr. Farrow. We both feel bad and ashamed of this and really it\u2019s something healthy that we have nothing to feel bad about. What do we do about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s a great topic, even just by bringing it up with each other. You are implicitly saying when you bring it up \u201cI don\u2019t think this has to be so bad.\u201d So if he starts hearing you say \u201cwhat\u2019s our hang-up about this?\u201d that that alone can start helping him ease this punitive, very critical <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C11\">voice in both of you about this part of being in emotional contact.  I think just talking about it would start to help that part of him lessen, too. (pause) Even if you ask him [jokingly, \u201cWhat do you think it\u2019s so wrong?\u201d] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C3\">CLIENT: I think we both kind of have a grasp on that. His dad is a pastor, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything, but his dad, before we got married, asked him, \u201cIs it getting hard for you and Ramona to not have sex? Is it hard to wait? All of our friends, including the bishop, had sex before they <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C31\">got married and they really regretted it; and we waited.\u201d And I\u2019m glad that Ivan and I waited and I don\u2019t think that, in itself, has to be a shaming thing but it felt like . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the thing about it, I don\u2019t think waiting has to be shaming or has to make sex a bad thing. I mean it can, but it doesn\u2019t have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C7\">CLIENT: It did for us somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C9\">THERAPIST: And it did for you. And that\u2019s the thing I think you both have to get more at because a parent can talk about waiting or encourage waiting in a way that really upholds the sexual encounter as a really beautiful, miraculous and special thing that you could be so excited to share with someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C91\">when you\u2019re married. But there is a way that you somehow didn\u2019t get that message. Something is going awry in the waiting part, as though it\u2019s something so shameful that you just have to put it off as long as possible or something. (pause) In your family, did your parents talk about waiting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CB\">CLIENT: No. It was assumed, understood. So many things were assumed and understood.  They also never talked to us about not drinking underage. They also never talked to us about not smoking or not doing drugs. At one point, my mom told me about a story. She was engaged and was so sure that they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200CB1\">getting married and had sex with him. And then she found out that he was writing to someone else and broke it off and it was devastating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CD\">THERAPIST: When did she tell you this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF\">CLIENT: Maybe I was in high school. But never \u201csex is really a healthy, wonderful part of a relationship\u201d or that physical contact is. These are things that are really okay and good to do as a high-schooler dating and these are things that are really special to wait for. Again, my parents just never <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF1\">would talk about that in any way, shape or form.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855940\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D1\">THERAPIST: They only talk about it as something they regretted. This is the other side of it. I think there is a really different side of it.  There is the angle of what you\u2019re being taught about it; but there is also the angle of how, then, is sex quietly being conceived of and dealt with in the family? <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D11\">For example, the fact that Ivan\u2019s parents are talking so much about it with him or the story that your mother is telling you. I know you\u2019re in high school, but your mother, still, at that age telling you the story about having sex with someone and then regretting it; it\u2019s a little inappropriate. I say <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D12\">that because that can also give you kind of \u201cugh.\u201d If you\u2019re the adolescent girl hearing your mom talking about having sex with someone . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like she mentioned anything. She just said it happens. But it also is kind of bizarre because, for example, she was 41 when she had me and she and my dad miscarried between Emma and me and she tried to get pregnant for like a year and a half.  She was like, \u201cI tried everything. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D31\">so determined. We wanted another baby so badly.\u201d Ironically, even then it\u2019s not acknowledged that sex is part of trying to have a baby and a normal, healthy, wonderful thing for two people to do. I guess I haven\u2019t heard it in a positive context and certainly, even now, I have a co-worker who will openly <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D32\">at lunch talk about sex with her boyfriend. She\u2019s worried that they\u2019re no longer having sex like 20 times a week and is that bad? And I\u2019m like oh, my gosh. (both chuckle) None of my close friends outside of her would ever talk about it or acknowledge it and I was just kind of like you don\u2019t do that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D33\">It\u2019s a private thing. So I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D5\">THERAPIST: So even just any attempt at being so taboo can\u2019t be spoken about at all. There is some hidden message that it is shameful [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:59) into words; instead of that it\u2019s private and that you can choose to share private parts of yourself when you\u2019re comfortable. Some of these <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D51\">most special parts of a person \u2013 like bodies. It\u2019s a really complicated a development teaching kids, for example, that you don\u2019t go around naked. How do you teach that message without making a child then feel ashamed of her vagina or her butt or that these are very special parts, instead of so bad that <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D52\">we must hide them from society. Do you know what I mean? It sounds like a really [helpful] (ph?) conversation for the two of you. That, alone, is starting a new kind of intimacy, to start talking about it together. You\u2019re breaking old patterns. Have a nice weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D7\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
