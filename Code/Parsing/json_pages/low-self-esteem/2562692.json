Come on in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">(pause 00:04:42 to 00:06:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to remember what we talked about on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(pause 00:06:46 to 00:07:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So, on Monday... my mom asked me if I was going to this... you know, get-together for this girl that I had a fight with on Thanksgiving. So was like, \u201cShe\u2019s going away and she\u2019s giving, you know, she\u2019s having a get-together, are you coming?\u201d And I was like, \u201cI wasn\u2019t invited.\u201d (sneezes, therapist blesses) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">Apparently, she sent an e-mail to everyone except me, and then... so I was like, \u201cWhy did you have to tell me this, mom? You know, make me more upset.\u201d (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So like, she said, she couldn\u2019t sleep all that night. Then the next morning, she called this girl (chuckles)... and then this girl was like... \u201cSo yeah, is Cecilia coming? Like my mom was like, \u201cDo you want her to?\u201d (chuckles) So she was like, \u201cYeah, it would be good to see her.\u201d So then she, this woman, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">sent this, sent me the e-mail. (chuckles) So then I sent her a nice note, \u201cOh, are you going away? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very successful in your project, and thank you for inviting me, and I\u2019ll see you... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So I went to the thing last night. I was just like really, you know like, I was observing myself and trying to understand like, the different things that I feel (chuckles), you know... and why do I feel them. (chuckles) So, I mean, obviously, it was nice of her to like, welcome me back, you know, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">we, our like, the little community, our little group, we always see each other and... You know, she\u2019s all about how she feels very loved and supported by all these people. (chuckles) I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Like, I wonder if I...\u201d I mean, I do feel that sometimes, obviously. But then when things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">go bad, it\u2019s awf , you know, it\u2019s like, I could throw it all away. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I was very, very upset on Monday. What is this like, the constant like... you know like... throwing me under the bus (chuckles) like, constant pinpricks, you know? \u201cOh, you know, we\u2019re having another party and you\u2019re not invited.\u201d And then another, the next week, the same thing. It was like, \u201cHow many <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">times are we going to do (chuckles) this?\u201d David was like, \u201cYeah, I know; just forget it. You know like, this is incredible, this is... I have an even... My opinion of your women\u2019s group is getting lower and lower,\u201d and this and that. He was just like... dragging me down and like, \u201cOh, poor you,\u201d this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">and that. (sighs) But I only saw him for like, an hour so that was good. (chuckles) So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Then, yeah, I don\u2019t know what went through this woman\u2019s mind, you know, but... But it was a little awkward, but... there were so many people there, and I kept asking her questions about her trip and like... So you know, I tried to be nice. (pause) So I just like, was watching myself like... I feel so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">insecure like, still and like, competitive and... and this need to prove that I am good, or I\u2019m better, or I won\u2019t be, you know, loved or something, you know. It was a good like... time, but obviously, because of things that have happened, I wasn\u2019t like, 100% in it, but just felt a little ironic about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">the situation, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562692\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">You know, there... You know like, my mom and like, another woman her age... and her husband and... and then people our age. So it\u2019s like a family, right? It\u2019s like parents and like, siblings. (chuckles) And like, she was the center of attention yesterday, which is, you know, all right, it\u2019s fine. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">I guess like, it makes me feel... insecure and like... competitive and... neglected. (chuckles) You know? Like, \u201cOh, she\u2019s going over to do this thing,\u201d you know like... When was the last time I won anything (chuckles), you know like... You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Sometimes when you say things that are especially painful, you giggle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Oh, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s painful. Is it painful? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Feeling neglected... Usually feeling neglected doesn\u2019t come with warm, happy thoughts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: (chuckles) No, I just feel silly. I feel like, \u201cWhy am I feeling this way? It\u2019s silly!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: There is no rationality for it. I mean, it\u2019s irrational, so... That\u2019s why I\u2019m giggling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Because you feel silly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Because you feel silly for having these feelings? (client affirms) (pause) What\u2019s silly about those feelings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: They\u2019re irrational. There is no need to feel neglected at that moment, you know. In fact, I was invited and like, like you say, you know like, I am wanted, so I should... feel that. (chuckles) instead of... an outsider. I could even take it a step further in a positive direction and be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">\u201cI am the prodigal son!\u201d How much more like, joy does the father bring to the prodigal son? I always like, rooted for the son who was around, in that story. (chuckles) Like, what... I\u2019ll bet that guy feels so bitter. (chuckles) He\u2019s been around and he\u2019s done everything, and the dad is all about like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">the son who runs away, didn\u2019t, you know, didn\u2019t give a fuck, you know? But, you know, people are like, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point of the story. The point of the story... is, you know like, the dad\u2019s love for... (chuckles) (sighs) Yeah. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like, intense like, those feelings, but... maybe because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">I was cognizant of them, and I was trying to question them. Like, \u201cWhy do I feel weird and...\u201d You know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(pause 00:14:17 to 00:14:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Feeling competitive and feeling like... I know more, or better, even though I don\u2019t. (chuckles) (pause) It\u2019s like, no wonder people don\u2019t want to hang out with me if I show that side (chuckles) of myself, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(pause 00:15:05 to 00:15:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Yeah, I definitely feel more insecure in such a setting than like... maybe like, a room full of strangers or, I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s a different thing. I have no like... objective opinion, I\u2019m just trying to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(pause 00:16:15 to 00:17:57)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I mean, I really have no, I don\u2019t have siblings, so I don\u2019t really know like, how that dynamic is supposed to work like, in a family. How do you win your parents\u2019 love when there is like... so many other... people to compete with, you know? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Does it feel like only one person gets it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Well like, at one time. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know what that means. Someone can only love one child at a time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) No, only one person can talk at one time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Okay. Is that what love is?

I\u2019ve lost you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve lost you. I\u2019m not sure I follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: But I mean like... yeah, love.

I don\u2019t know. (pause) But like you know like... like affection. Like, David is affectionate when, you know, when he finds me cute. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re so cute and you\u2019re...\u201d Then he might, maybe, give me a hug. So that\u2019s something I\u2019m doing, I feel (chuckles), <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">I\u2019m being cute. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: When he... when he gives you a hug, are you aware of consciously being cute, so you get a hug?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Well, no, there is a rationality behind that hug, you know. Like, I\u2019ve earned it because I\u2019m being cute. (pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know. And like Nelson might hug me, because I\u2019m sexy or I\u2019m being sexy at that moment. You know so that\u2019s like... there is (chuckles), you know, that... yeah. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And when they\u2019re not hugging you, then they\u2019re not, they don\u2019t have feelings for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Hmm, well... they\u2019re just busy. (chuckles) Or ignoring me, I guess... to get stuff done. (chuckles), which is okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: But does that... I guess I\u2019m... you\u2019re equating feelings and behavior. So I\u2019m trying to understand; if they\u2019re not behaving a particular way towards you, their feelings have gone, in your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: (affirms) Like you\u2019ve fallen off their radar. (client affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">(pause 00:21:50 to 00:23:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I think like... in a group setting like, that and like... I guess everyone does that, but you know, you\u2019re constantly trying to think of something funny to say, or something interesting... so people, you know like, you\u2019re on the radar, you know like... so... (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">I don\u2019t know, at least I\u2019ll be helpful, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(pause) But you know, another thing that I have to add to my list (chuckles) now, that I never used to be there, is not to be nasty or snarky, to take responsibility for what I say. (pause) Yeah, like... these people, you know, take a long time to recover from hurts. You know like, if I hurt them... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">I will (chuckles) get hurt back, and it won\u2019t just be like, you know, one time. They, it could be a repeated thing like, you know? I mean, every week they\u2019ll have a party, and I\u2019ll hear about it, and I won\u2019t be invited, so... Certainly don\u2019t want that kind of treatment, you know? So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: (pause) But it also makes me think about how it\u2019s so important for you to get reactions from people, and as you said, getting a negative reaction is better than no reaction. I\u2019m thinking about why that is, and how it\u2019s hard in the absence of immediate feedback or reaction or behavior, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">feel very unloved and uncared for. (client responds) Like you\u2019re not even registering for the other person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know why that is.

(pause) You know like, if they\u2019re interacting with you, and even if the interaction is negative, at least... you know if (yawns) they\u2019re thinking about you. (pause) I mean, I don\u2019t know if I have a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">constant need for interaction. I\u2019m trying not to be that way. (chuckles) Like, I feel like maybe like, spending alone time will teach me how to not be needy like that. (pause) Like to find... interaction with myself fulfilling, you know? Like, staying inside myself.

Like, if a parent were focused on, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">your sibling and whatever they were doing, you know that somehow you would not be loved anymore, that they would be the one who would be winning the love. (client responds) And it\u2019s very hard to function in that experience. (client responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, I mean, I\u2019m trying to replace that by thinking that my turn will come. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s one way. I mean, certainly that\u2019s one way of thinking about it. (client affirms) But it still leaves some insecurity, because you\u2019re waiting for your turn, versus just feeling that... it\u2019s always your turn, in a sense. It\u2019s not your turn to always be the focus, but it\u2019s your <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">turn, because you\u2019re present in someone\u2019s mind, even if you\u2019re not, you know, physically present with them or have their attention. (client responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">(pause 00:29:59 to 00:30:36)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">I mean, one way of thinking about this, in a particular way, is that, I mean, you (from your mother to some extent in some ways, but you certainly from your parents), did not sort of feel sufficiently and adequately loved and cared for. So you essentially developed theories as to, \u201cOkay, well maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">I can do this to make it happen.\u201d You know, in the absence of that, \u201cOh, well, then, if I do this or if I did this, then I can make that happen.\u201d That is sort of what you do. (client affirms) You take it upon yourself to have to do something... even though you think your childhood is far from ideal, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">you don\u2019t think about the deficits in it, in that respect. (client responds) I mean, you could say, you didn\u2019t have any siblings, so you should have felt so loved, you had no competition! (client chuckles) But you didn\u2019t feel that way. (client affirms) because that wasn\u2019t the point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I should have, but (chuckles)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You should feel that way if your hypothesis is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: (responds) (pause) I mean, it was performance driven. Like, my dad would be (inaudible) just say, you know, \u201cStudy hard, that\u2019s all we want from you.\u201d You know just like, \u201cGet the highest marks,\u201d and stuff and like... And I couldn\u2019t, because (chuckles) I guess I was, you know, sad as a child <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">and you know like... I didn\u2019t want to study and... you know, I just wanted to read novels. (pause) Yeah. So... then I just, I guess I reasoned that, you know, \u201cOkay, so I\u2019m not loved, because I didn\u2019t study hard.\u201d (chuckles) So... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562692\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s locating the problem inside you and not inside (ph) him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. My mom did love me, she does love me, but she didn\u2019t have the training to be like... overtly affectionate or like, you know like, vocalize her love. But she was herself, you know like... troubled (chuckles) with, you know, all the things that were going on. So she didn\u2019t have the wherewithal <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">to be effusive and, you know like, positive and loving, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s very true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: (pause) So I guess I do have like, a performance-driven idea of love, that... you know, the brighter you shine, the better you do something, the more love you\u2019re going to get, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: You have a performance-driven idea of a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: A lot of things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Self-esteem, too. You know, you feel good about yourself when you accomplish the sentence and this... (client affirms) You are very much, you\u2019re very organized around being performance driven (client chuckles), which I guess, you know, is adaptive to the extent that it gives you the feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">of having control. (client affirms) (pause) But it also chronically leaves you feeling frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: (responds) (pause) Yeah, and it\u2019s like incredible to me when that doesn\u2019t work and makes me fucking frustrated (chuckles) so frustrated. Like, last night like, they were talking about movies. This woman, you know, who I feel is so loved, is just like, naming all these movies that are like shit! <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">I\u2019m like... And I\u2019m not, I\u2019m being nice, I\u2019m smiling and nodding, but in my head, I\u2019m rolling my eyes! I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you seri , like... You have no taste!\u201d (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">I\u2019m like, \u201cHow is this possible? I\u2019ve seen... You know like, I have such good taste in this and that, you know like... but why is it that... yeah, you know? Why am I not winning?\u201d (therapist affirms) But then I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d (chuckles) And it\u2019s just like it\u2019s... it\u2019s the person, it\u2019s not performance, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">but then maybe a person has performance too. It\u2019s like, she\u2019s just, she just gives the impression of being so filled with love and like... that people don\u2019t like... People are just attracted to that. Like, I would be attracted to that. I am, you know? No one wants to be... for a very extended period <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">of time, with someone who is crying constantly and trying to prove something. You know? So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">She was talking about her vacation with her family and her siblings. Like, she was happy and she was, you know, telling us all these stories and like... in a, you know like... Yeah, so it\u2019s just... And you want to hear that. She has a loud voice and a loud laugh and like, you want to like... constantly <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">be looking at it, you know? It doesn\u2019t matter that she was wearing a brown, dull brown sweater and I was wearing a bright red sweater, you know? (chuckles) Like, yeah... It\u2019s like, it\u2019s like there is a tap inside of her that\u2019s constantly on, so... (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">But then, what do I do about it, how do I qualitatively, quantitatively feel about this, you know? Like, she spent her vacation with her family and her siblings. I spent my vacation, you know like, helping my friend apply for a PhD program, feeling anxious and frustrated and like, you know... (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">affirms) (pause) Yeah, so I mean, you know like (chuckles)... What do we, how do we... what do you do about it? I don\u2019t have a family or siblings, I didn\u2019t like... yeah. I didn\u2019t have... days off where I... could just, you know, chill with people I\u2019ve known all my life. (chuckles) And cook with them <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">and like... yeah. Once like, I had. I cooked dinner with... with my mom. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562692\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, you\u2019re in a group, and you think about what some of these people in the group have that you don\u2019t have (client affirms), in terms of people in your life, and you miss the fact that you\u2019re with a group of people (client chuckles), and you\u2019re in that group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: (responds) (pause) I try to not miss it, I mean like... I know that like, you have to build stuff, I\u2019ve learned that. Instead of looking out constantly, I\u2019m starting to think about looking in. (chuckles) And maybe also looking in... I mean, I was only going to stay there for an hour, but I ended <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">up staying there for... you know, two hours and a half, so it\u2019s like... so I must have felt invested, I wasn\u2019t just like, there for like... \u201cOh, this is going to be pinpricks all along. Let\u2019s just, you know, get tortured.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like that (therapist affirms), you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">It was like, you know like, there was food. I mean, even if you didn\u2019t cook it or serve it, you appreciate it and like, you know, you make sure everyone has had enough, you know. So it\u2019s like, everyone does that, so... I try to do that (chuckles), you know and like... talk to people and... and try and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">do things together, make plans for doing certain things together. But along with that, there is also like... you know, all that baggage that\u2019s there with me constantly. You know like, feeling small or (inaudible) or insecure or thinking about stuff that they have that I don\u2019t have. (chuckles) (therapist affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">(pause) Yeah, of course I\u2019m jealous that, you know, she has a family to go home to for holidays, but then, you know, there are other people like me, too. Like, this other woman, she had a much worse vacation. Like, she like me, was here and she was going through some emotional shit and she didn\u2019t do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">anything, so... At least mine wasn\u2019t as bad as hers, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">(pause) But there is something that happens in me that makes me feel like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m superior, because I helped someone, or I did something, and I worked,\u201d you know. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of a family, so, you know, you\u2019re you know like, simple-minded to enjoy that and I\u2019m more superior because I... <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">did something more complex (chuckles) you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Because you feel it needs to be a competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t like that. I want to change that but, you know... (therapist affirms) I mean, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be like that where, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, yay, you have a family, yes! Good for you!\u201d That\u2019s fake! (chuckles) You know. I\u2019ll still feel sad and I think that\u2019s legitimate, that I\u2019ll feel sad <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">that I don\u2019t have that, because everyone should want it, or have it, or something, you know? (therapist affirms) But it shouldn\u2019t be like, a hierarchy or you know like, I shouldn\u2019t (inaudible) like, find a high horse pronto and climb on it! (chuckles) you know? (therapist affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562692\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, you feel that there are some things in finite quantities, like love. There is only so much love, and the more a sibling gets, the less another sibling gets. (client affirms) And there is only so much good feeling and someone gets, you know, the positive feelings, then there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">is none leftover. So it\u2019s kind of a way of thinking that\u2019s sort of organized around scarcity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Why is that? (pause) I don\u2019t know. I feel like, because there was like, scarcity when I was growing up, you know? (therapist affirms) Like, I could count the number of days when my dad was positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But the scarcity had much more to do with what was inside or not inside him, not about what other people were or weren\u2019t getting. (client responds) But it sort of morphed, for you, into sort of feeling like... a distribution of resources or mis-distribution rather than just sort of a lack. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: (responds) (pause) I mean, I feel the same way about David also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Maybe there was a scarcity of love. There was only a little bit to be had, so like, I\u2019ll do something you know like, whatever to like, get it. (therapist responds) Then it wasn\u2019t like, this like, long... unending like... you know, expanse of time and togetherness that could be, you know, enjoyed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD1\">no matter when or where. (chuckles) Obviously not, because (chuckles) you know, yeah, that will mean that we were happy together and we were, we are still together. (chuckles) But I feel that way with like...
