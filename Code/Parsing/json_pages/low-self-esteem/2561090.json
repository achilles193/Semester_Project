I don\u2019t know. I guess I mean I felt like I had all the [inaudible] resolved in my head earlier [inaudible] how kids can be mean and this and that, but I guess the emotional impact is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">else. And I can rationalize it and say kids can be mean and they were insecure or whatever, that\u2019s why they treated me that way. [00:02:05.19] But I mean I was aware of that even as I was going through it, to the extent that I could have been when I was 11. My mom saw it I guess. She was like yes, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">girl\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t really love her so that\u2019s why she\u2019s troubled. So I understood that rationally but like the emotional impact of it just kind of it was resided with me somewhere. And now when I do certain things or feel a certain way I think the power imbalance that I feel may be some part of me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">I feel like is reaching out to that experience and kind of, I don\u2019t know, feeling badly. Does that happen or even when you rationalize something and you accept it and you see it in a rational way, there\u2019s still the negative it affects you negatively despite that. [00:03:16.02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like that happened is happening to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: So I\u2019m very I always get a little confused when this happens. You said you\u2019ll say this is what\u2019s happening to me; does that happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I mean yes, the answer\u2019s yes, but I don\u2019t really understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: What do you mean you don\u2019t understand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Well you\u2019ll say that this is how I feel, do people feel that way. Well you feel that way, so I guess there\u2019s like the question is probably more complicated than it seems. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m looking for feedback. [00:04:16.26] Am I making sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Is it more than that? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Or guidance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Somehow you\u2019re checking in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, the need for approval. I don\u2019t know. Maybe not. Yeah. I mean yeah. (pause) And then [inaudible] I feel the need for approval, or if not approval, then maybe like acceptance. [00:06:14.03] Acceptance might be more level [ph] I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t interact with my mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">in this manner as much. Maybe I should more. So I don\u2019t turn other people into sources of approval. I guess it\u2019s happened before, the emotional [inaudible] certain thing remains despite me having rationalized it and said okay, that\u2019s taken care of. [00:07:12.29] That\u2019s not going to bother me, is I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">know the rational [inaudible] but that doesn\u2019t really work out that way I guess. (pause) It\u2019s more like power by association thing is not it\u2019s going to be it\u2019s going to take me a while to understand it, I think, and come to terms with it and feel it in a healthy way. Power can be abused so much. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">[00:08:00.22] Maybe in itself it\u2019s not bad, but then if you are insecure then [inaudible] abuse it. Yeah, I mean that\u2019s been like the hardest thing, I guess, with Chris, [ph] and I guess that ties into the other piece we were talking about me [inaudible] people who put me down. And that\u2019s not necessarily <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200254\">like I guess that\u2019s like a gray zone right now in my head because I don\u2019t know if I like [inaudible] accept consciously but I think other people put me down. I\u2019m thinking of people who are smarter. Not necessarily smarter than me, but are smart or have more than me, whatever it is. [00:09:06.27] More <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200255\">confidence and whatever. But I guess that\u2019s been my mode since I graduated college. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t thought about it in this way at all so now I have to think. I think that\u2019s where I we ended last time, was it? On Wednesday. Wasn\u2019t I thinking of how I met Chris and stuff? I mean I had this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200256\">gigantic fear that I just cannot learn otherwise or get better or improve, specifically in the area of intellectual growth. [00:10:12.09] I don\u2019t really well I don\u2019t I mean in wanting to be an artist and trying to be an artist I mean and obviously there\u2019s I feel like there\u2019s so much that I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200257\">to do, and when I decided to pursue that I was reading a lot because I wasn\u2019t an English major. I didn\u2019t read. I didn\u2019t have as much reading then as I feel like an English major would have, so I\u2019m still catching up with that. And in terms of being socially conscious and being political, now I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200258\">I have more of like a community that\u2019ll help me be this way. [00:11:07.14] But I feel like it\u2019s really it really has been being with Chris has really had a deep impact on in this area, in developing my thinking and learning how to be curious about everything and but since he wasn\u2019t just a friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200259\">there were all these other emotions attached. So I guess I felt the power in that, and then at some point I learned to rebel. And I felt better at some other point and so I desperately wanted to be my own person, do my own thinking in my own way. But I mean so yeah, I feel like I would say I sought <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002510\">him out because he was very intelligent and very curious, always thinking and always thinking in a unique way. [00:12:20.19] I used to think like when I first met him I used to think and definitely remember thinking I could be I could go anywhere with this guy and I would no longer feel depressed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002511\">That wasn\u2019t that didn\u2019t hold true for even a year though. I remember thinking I could go we could be sitting in McDonald\u2019s and it would be fine. And then I moved to a completely new town with him. [00:13:03.02] We moved from Virginia to Cambridge and lived together, and I was very depressed because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002512\">I didn\u2019t have anything to do. Like he was starting a PhD program and I didn\u2019t have anything to do there in that town. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been to Cambridge but...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561090\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like a college town. There are five colleges there. And unless you\u2019re part of that, [inaudible] thing to do there. So I was like working at a bookstore for a little bit and then little things like that. I applied to like graduate school and then got in, but I deferred so I could go <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">stay with him. And then I was like this is this sucks. [00:14:07.14] So then I went and accepted my admission and I moved to Ohio and [inaudible] my own study. But that was a weird time. That decision to move with him came about like in a weird way, I feel like, because the summer before his parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">had were visiting from India, and I met them for the first time here in the U.S. And at that time they were going through some financial difficulties and I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why this wasn\u2019t up for debate but I was telling them yeah, I want to be an artist and I just got accepted to Columbia <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">and I\u2019m going to go and study there. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with the degree. It\u2019s very expensive and I have to take out loans. And his mom was like very well she\u2019d just met me, so I feel like I guess she wasn\u2019t very, I don\u2019t want to say, supportive, but she was probably like confused. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200294\">[00:15:20.02] So she said to me, art is a luxury. And I don\u2019t know why I took it in a negative way, but I did, and it remained with me. And I hated her for saying that. So I felt very discouraged. And I guess I\u2019ve had some distance from that time now so I can kind of say or rationalize, you know. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200295\">were going through a tough time. They didn\u2019t know me. They\u2019re not very emotional. They\u2019re very stable people, like staid almost. But at that time I was very upset by that and it affected me so much that I had to forward my aggression, and I moved with their son to live with him. [00:16:12.11] I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200296\">I guess they scared me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561090\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t really with it. I didn\u2019t really have like a path or anything. I had graduated college and I was actually thinking of getting a masters in computer science. That was my background so I thought I\u2019d get a masters. I think I had I mean I got in to school and but then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">deferred that admission too. I think that was right when my parents were splitting up so that was a very traumatic time anyway. And then my ex-boyfriend had moved out of state for a job and I got a job myself, which I was terrified of. [00:17:09.23] I had such panic attacks just sitting at the desk <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">there and really not wanting to go to work and [inaudible] were intense. But I don\u2019t know. Somehow I kept with it for a year. And I think it was during that time I met Chris. And we would have such intellectual conversations. And I wanted to be an artist so I applied and he was applying to graduate <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D3\">schools, too, and so I guess I also applied with him to [inaudible] I mean I didn\u2019t really clearly know what I was doing in that sense but I guess I had a vague idea. [00:18:06.03] I think it was that and that I was also getting therapy. But it didn\u2019t really work out. I think they put me on medicine <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D4\">too. I can\u2019t remember which medicine it was. Zoloft or Prozac or something. For a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It didn\u2019t work out in what sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: The woman said nothing. I was with her for, I don\u2019t know, a few months, maybe a year. She never said anything. And I just was I can\u2019t even remember the therapy sessions now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s too bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, it really didn\u2019t do anything. [00:19:02.10] Confused me more, I feel like. Plus, maybe I was too young or inexperienced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Why would you take that on yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to say anything bad about therapists. I feel like it\u2019s growth, part of growth, right, to take responsibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I guess there\u2019s responsibility and then there\u2019s blame.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I feel like I\u2019ve been blaming a lot. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of blaming the past few years. [00:20:03.18] So I am conscious of that. Yeah, even in the scenario where Chris\u2019s parents scared me, whatever, I do feel like I could\u2019ve done something about it. I could\u2019ve been stronger <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">but I wasn\u2019t so plus I really wanted them to like me, especially his mom, and she\u2019s a very, very strong personality. So I guess I just got, I don\u2019t know, weirdly dominated without even me knowing it. So I yeah, that\u2019s what I ended up doing that year. And then really being very miserable. [00:21:02.26] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">It\u2019s like it\u2019s funny, this thing I do this thing, and I\u2019m becoming conscious of it, and I think it\u2019s very helpful to be conscious of it, that I look back on a certain time and I hate it. And I hate everything about it. But only recently now that I\u2019m aware that I do this I\u2019m like okay, so that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D3\">year, just because I was miserable and that whole thing was bad doesn\u2019t mean that Chris is bad, and my relationship with him was always bad, and I should never be with him. Because even though I was sad and depressed and had nothing to do, I think we had a decent time together doing certain things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D4\">But when I feel badly about it, I think back and I just hate everything about it. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it or think about it. [00:22:10.10] But I feel like I should take ownership of that and be like well, that was my decision to move with him. I had just met him and I really I felt so <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D5\">intensely for him and he was I felt like I could get a lot out of being with him and perhaps I guess I did. I don\u2019t truly know how to measure that. Maybe it\u2019s not important to measure it, (pause) but I don\u2019t know. [00:23:12.27] I guess sometimes I think that what if I hadn\u2019t followed him. What if <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D6\">I was a stronger person or could\u2019ve become stronger? Would I have how what would I be like right now? Maybe it\u2019s pointless to think that way, but I think sometimes of feeling more confident about myself and having my own thinking. I guess that\u2019s what I feel, like do I when I give up my independence <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D7\">and lean on him, do I become a better person? Do I learn more? Or is that like a tradeoff? Like being with him equals learning more versus not being with him but being confident but not learning as much. [00:24:13.02] You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561090\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re putting them in the same category?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m like I feel like there\u2019s that dichotomy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Right. But is learning more meaning being less confident?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, because then it would be through him that I learned it not on my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: What does learning something on your own look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Going to school, learning it through anywhere but him.

It\u2019s [inaudible] I\u2019ll try. I don\u2019t know. [00:26:04.09] I feel like I was so raw, so green, like so uncultured before I met him. Maybe I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: But it seems like there\u2019s something almost embarrassing about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: There is, there is. I don\u2019t know what or why. I almost want to make a list now, like how much should I really know on my own and before I met him. I mean I have picked up French literature on my own. I picked up Proust. I bought a lot of books on my own. I had read a lot of the stuff that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">near and dear to me now. [00:27:04.27] But oh God, this is so bad. I don\u2019t want to do this. It\u2019s like divorce or I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s something like that. I remember one moment he was talking about Borges and I was like yeah, I had no idea if I had actually even heard of Borges\u2019 name before Chris. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">I remember clearly going to Barnes and Noble on my lunch break, buying a copy of his collected poems, and roughing it up a bit and putting it into my on my bookshelf so that that evening when he came over he could see that I already read Borges.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561090\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You wanted to impress him? [00:28:09.22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean I think he\u2019s my favorite poet but Chris likes him [inaudible] so there is this exchange but it wasn\u2019t so much mutual. I don\u2019t know. I feel like maybe I was never able to hold my own or I was just I lacked confidence and maybe kept losing it because of not being assertive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">And I understand that we have very different modes of understanding. I\u2019m very emotional and I understand things through emotion, through empathy. And he\u2019s very cerebral so but there is already, because of forces beyond our control, there\u2019s the power and balance. And even that, it\u2019s considered loftier <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">to be cerebral than to be emotional. [00:29:11.28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Says you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: Says me? Yeah, but I don\u2019t know. I feel like that, and other people say it too. Anyway, so and we were hanging out and I\u2019ve met his friends. This is like the first year we were going out. And then I met Victor. [ph] I mean that year, way back when. And the three of us would watch all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">really interesting all this really interesting cinema together. And that was also that opened my eyes to good art. So I feel like I give Chris a lot of credit for my intellectual growth. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s really embarrassing. [00:30:04.12] I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s embarrassing but it is. Maybe it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">like asking a child to I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you feel small.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel very small, I feel like, because I didn\u2019t do all of this myself. He listens to so much better music than me. And that really scares you, freaks me out. So this weekend I spent with this other guy and I just I mean I\u2019m having a good time with him and his friends, but then I\u2019m checking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">my phone and Chris is posting stuff on Facebook and I\u2019m like he\u2019s lonely and I feel guilty about that. [00:31:03.23] But then I\u2019m like, you know, I am so scared of losing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: Of losing Chris?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, of his of the intellectual stimulation I get from him. I\u2019m more afraid of losing that. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m more afraid of losing, that or the life we have [inaudible] together. Or had together. I think how am I going to I feel like I\u2019m just going to stop growing intellectually without <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">him, even though I\u2019m in school, even though I have teachers, even though I know where the going gets tough from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you feel you\u2019re a kid who needs a parent. [00:32:04.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I don\u2019t want to give my parent up. I could give up sex; I don\u2019t think I can give up my parent. Are we done? Do you think I should give up my parent if I have to become an adult?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561090\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s a parent in your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: He shouldn\u2019t have been, huh, if our relationship was to work out. No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Am I supposed to be the parent now? [00:33:05.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: You\u2019re just an expert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: But maybe I have confidence that you can hear these things out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose. It\u2019s weird. So I\u2019m hanging out with this guy\u2019s friends. I cooked them dinner and it was and we were drunk, so maybe that had something to do with it, but it was like such a level playing field I found. And obviously the more level playing field is also my feeling but I felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">like it felt kind of calm and with it and I was myself, my boisterous opinionated self. [00:34:09.19] But I didn\u2019t feel uneasy, which is what I feel most of the time, or all the time with Chris\u2019s friends, because they tend to be academics, professors or post docs. [ph] Maybe it\u2019s not just me feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200792\">small but it\u2019s also the aura that they have. [inaudible] it\u2019s just the dynamic. But I guess I\u2019m just bringing this up just because [inaudible] saying that I seek out higher ground. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the way of putting it. But seeking people who have more or seeking people who put you down [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel they put you down? [00:35:08.21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: Hmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Do you feel they put you down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Or I feel put down. I don\u2019t know if they do it or if it\u2019s me. Maybe it\u2019s mutual. Maybe it\u2019s in some context it\u2019s mutual but in some context it\u2019s just me, I\u2019m feeling. But that\u2019s what I mean. That\u2019s the uneasiness. Yeah, I\u2019m having a good time with these people who are probably my age and they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">they have more money, but hey, [ph] I don\u2019t feel as threatened by them having more money as I feel threatened by people who have more knowledge, who have more purpose. So I\u2019m having a good time but then at the end of the evening the thought that there are these groups out there, or even thought that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200812\">I could\u2019ve been with Chris that night and cooked for his friends. [00:36:04.14] And what was my loss that evening? The all the great intellectual conversations that I missed out on and I\u2019m going to keep missing out on if I\u2019m not with him and I\u2019m with someone who\u2019s not intellectual. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: Does it make sense how you\u2019re thinking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. Am I still thinking in terms of categories and strict [inaudible] categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: I keep wanting to say, what do you think? Who cares what I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Do we have time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You\u2019re sort of aware of the clock time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m always [ph]. I don\u2019t know really [inaudible] this out [ph]. I really do. [00:37:08.22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: This thing that I feel. I\u2019m feeling cranky about it because I\u2019ve been struggling with it for a while now. Even like the I think I realized this the morning after the gathering. It was like what were you guys talking about? I have no idea. You guys were so inarticulate. I said that to this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200911\">guy. And he didn\u2019t take it personally, I think, but I was just thinking yeah, these guys are so much fun and they didn\u2019t put me down and we were just chilling. And I think we were trying to talk about Indian cities and the mentality of people there, but these guys not being intellectuals or not having <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200912\">done hard thinking about their experiences, this was what it was. [00:38:24.09] But if I compare it to any other evening I\u2019ve had with Chris and his friends, the intellectual quotient [ph] of that conversation is so high I come away with learning so much. I feel threatened, I feel kind of small, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200913\">I come away with knowledge that I feel like I could use, I could write about. And so just in terms of that, just plainly, very selfishly thinking of wanting to be a writer and wanting to have wanting intellectual stimulation, valuing that over everything else, I feel very scared. [00:39:11.23] I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200914\">lost now. It\u2019s not that I will never be a part of those of that group. It\u2019s just what I identify myself with and having been and realizing that okay, hanging out with people who know way more than me all the time maybe is having a negative psychological impact on me, making me feel less confident <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200915\">about myself, even though it shouldn\u2019t. But it has. Is that a fair statement that it has or I feel like it is. I mean yeah, that\u2019s all, figuring this piece out. [00:40:09.09]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561090\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a catch-22 because if I don\u2019t say anything it seems like you feel anxious and maybe that I\u2019m not present in some way, but if I do say something, like give you the answer answer, that somehow I\u2019m undermining your ability to feel that you can think for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. I put you in a catch-22.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t a complaint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Seeing these \u201cintellectuals\u201d as on a higher plain is your only construction. [00:41:06.09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And I\u2019m aware of how that construction happened. I hadn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t a part of that world. I desperately wanted to be a part of that world. And I was a part. And then I became a part of that world and that\u2019s all that I knew. But I never forgot that I came from nothing, or like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">I didn\u2019t come from a background that they did. Although they all have very different backgrounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure. You tend to sort of homogenize people, and then when you think about it, they seem far less homogenous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I should be aware of that. [00:42:02.27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s a way of maintaining this feeling of being an outsider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I have to work on that. I remember so clearly you saying it sounds like you said it sounds like this guy really wants you, and that really freaked me out when you said that because I cling so steadfastly to my position of an outsider that it really messes with my head when I realize <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">that people want me in. I have to work on that. Even Chris, he will say he will agree that he wants me in. [00:43:00.11] He might not know how to say it or show it. In spite of his mom being as harsh as she is, even she would say that she wants me in. (pause) This will take we\u2019ll have to we should <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A52\">talk about this on Wednesday, the origins of my feeling like an outsider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: That is part of the story of what you\u2019re describing [inaudible] room with all these kids who had more money. [00:44:05.23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: Mm-hm. That really that\u2019s where it started I\u2019m sure. I wasn\u2019t aware of being an outsider before that. There was no inside or outside, there was just an inside I think. It was just me and my mom. (pause) Yeah, I guess just like the previous thing about intellectuals versus nonintellectuals. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A91\">I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s part of my identity or what it is that I yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m like grappling with. [00:45:02.18] Should I distance myself from them so I can do my own thinking and feel more confident, or am I running away from them because I\u2019ve been hurt or but then I shouldn\u2019t be running <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A92\">away.
