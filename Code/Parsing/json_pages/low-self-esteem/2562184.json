Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Nah. I\u2019ve had a rough couple days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it\u2019s, you know\u2014I want to say, you know, a lot of it\u2019s like most things is\u2014there\u2019s a very small part of it where I\u2019m a victim of circumstance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: (laughter) That was very candid. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t try to (crosstalk 00:00:39) those instances. But I think the rest of it was, you know. So, I wasn\u2019t feeling good on Saturday and Marcia was throwing a 50th birthday party for her sister. But her brother-in-law and a friend of her sister\u2019s. And it was very stressful, you know. Bands breaking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">up and cancelling and, you know. Does she know? You know all the shit that goes along with it, you know. And I had taken Ian rock climbing. Of course, I did the rock climbing. I got belaying burn from the rope there. But I think I just kind of overdid it. I really didn\u2019t feel well. I was nauseous. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">was just exhausted. I was just like, you know. And then it was any other thing I was just blowing it off, you know. Like I can\u2019t blow this off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So, I rallied. And went ahead, you know, a fun time, you know. I didn\u2019t see Marcia very much but didn\u2019t expect to, you know. And, of course, she says afterwards, \u201cYou know I like the,\u201d\u2014or, \u201cI love the fact that, you know, you can just go off on your own and I,\u201d\u2014whatever. You know, that\u2019s fine. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">funny because it used to bother me with Jess. But Jess would always dump me in a room with people I don\u2019t know and just never even like check back in, you now. You know, where Marcia doesn\u2019t do that in an instance where I know people who are there. At least introduces me to people or\u2014so, you know, have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">a good time. Party is over. You know, you go home. And I don\u2019t know how we got on the subject. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">You know, I think I brought up, you know, the time that maybe it was about\u2014because she is on this thing about me not taking her phone calls. I was just doing this thing where it\u2019s like when people phone call me\u2014I don\u2019t care who it is it\u2019s an interruption. So, I\u2019m doing something, you know, like just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">trying to get out the door of my apartment, I\u2019m not going to take the phone call, you know. I can call you back in five minutes. 20, whatever it is, you know. And, you know, it was a while ago, she got upset with me because she called. I never saw that she called. I texted her like a moment later or <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">a moment before and, you know, she basically stood me up that night. Didn\u2019t want to go to a show we\u2019re supposed to go to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And, you know, for awhile I thought, you know, we had this conversation where I thought we were joking and she was pissed off. And somehow that night I brought that up, you know. And it turns out there was something else going on which now, you know, makes sense. And, you know, she has this like really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">(chuckles) bizarre which you probably find no problem with. But she\u2019s very self-conscious about her hair. And not being about to deal with it. You know, I really don\u2019t even comprehend. You know, does she have the most beautiful head of hair? No. But, you know. But I understand, you know, it\u2019s a chick, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">you know. How it really can bother her. You know, to the point of being something, you know. (telephone rings) (inaudible 00:04:11), you know, I mean she may have said it. But, you know, I wasn\u2019t aware this was like the deepest, darkest secret she has which I know it\u2019s not. But that\u2019s how she\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">of treating it or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562184\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">And, you know, I\u2019m drunk. It\u2019s, you know, late in the morning. You know, later whatever. And this part I really don\u2019t remember because I had kind of gone, take off my clothes, and like hop into bed. Figured that we were going to bed. And she says that she said, \u201cSorry for putting this on you.\u201d And that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">my response was, \u201cDon\u2019t bother putting it on me,\u201d or some response like that. And, you know, it took me a couple\u2014this was Saturday. It took me until like late yesterday to figure out that all the time she\u2019s saying sorry for stuff that she doesn\u2019t need to say sorry for. And what I most likely said and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">mumbled and slurred and with her poor hearing, you know, I probably said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say sorry for putting this on me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: And she, of course, heard the exact opposite. Well, you know, I didn\u2019t realize this until I woke up at about a quarter to four and the light is on in the bedroom. She\u2019s not there. And I get up. I\u2019m half asleep. I\u2019m half drunk. I walk out. I see her. You know, and I don\u2019t know why, but whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">the encounter was I got angry. You know, just, you know\u2014I don\u2019t know what she\u2014I didn\u2019t even know what she said to me. I went to the bathroom and I\u2019m stewing as I\u2019m in the bathroom. Like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I don\u2019t even know what I was upset about. I really don\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">So, I go and I, you know, go back into the bedroom and for some reason, I slam the door. I didn\u2019t know she was right behind me. So, I slam door in her face. So, she comes in. \u201cWhy\u2019d you slam the door in my face?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know you were behind me.\u201d \u201cWell, why are you slamming the door? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">You have no reason to be slamming the door.\u201d Because, you know, she\u2019s the pissed off one, you know. And then proceeds to tell me that I broke her heart. And this whole thing about, you know, what I had said. And I\u2019m just like, you know\u2014I have no responses or, you know. This is like I\u2019m fucking back <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">in Vietnam now where it\u2019s like I had no response to anything. I had no\u2014I just can\u2019t think. I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m like how did I get myself in this situation? You know. You know, she ends up leaving the room. And I\u2019m just sitting there and I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">almost 4:00 in the morning.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">I don\u2019t even know what I was thinking, but I got up. I got dressed and I left which apparently ripped her heart out. She called a friend, who lives a half away at 4:00 in the morning. And she came and consoled her. And now I\u2019m not the person that she thought I was or our relationship wasn\u2019t where she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">thought it was. And so, I\u2019ve just been sleeping for the last few days, you know. It\u2019s like okay. She won\u2019t call me, you know. She started texting me a little more yesterday. And, you know, I had this box where I was like saving things from, you know, ticket stubs and notes she wrote me and things like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">that. And, you know, part of me felt that maybe this would be a great little way to show, you know, ten years from now, 15 years from now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562184\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">And, you know, I\u2019m a lawyer so always, you know, in the back of my mind that this thing could be pulled out at a moment of (laughter) this breaking place emergency. And I really didn\u2019t think\u2014I really didn\u2019t comprehend sort of\u2014you know, how bad this was going when\u2014you know, because she gets hot headed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">She, you know, goes, you know, months without speaking to some of her best friends. You know it\u2019s\u2014you know, they\u2019re stuck in this high school world, you know. And so part of me\u2014I know I fucked up and I wasn\u2019t denying it. I was apologizing. But I tried to explain that, you know, this may have been what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">the misinterpretation was. And her response is, \u201cWell, why did you slam the door in my face?\u201d And I was just like, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">So, I went in and pulled out the box. And I made a video, you know. Here\u2019s the Christmas card you gave me. Here\u2019s the note when I stayed over and took care of the dog. And, you know, on down the line, you know, which I finally got a response of, \u201cYou know, that was thoughtful,\u201d whatever. And because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">the thing that was pissing me off the most is it\u2019s like, you know, 99.9% of the time, you know, I\u2019m superman. And then there\u2019s this one thing happens and I know it\u2019s not like a small thing, but, you know, there\u2019s no concern for all the other stuff. It\u2019s just to be able to just turn on a dime like that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B2\">you know, just is\u2014I don\u2019t understand it. I understand getting mad at someone, but I don\u2019t understand this, you know\u2014all the sudden from one thing you said when you\u2019re drunk, half asleep at 4:00 in the morning changes a relationship or how you feel about someone. It still doesn\u2019t make sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">But I\u2019m going to try to make sense of it because men are from Mars and women are from Venus. And luckily, I read something on Facebook where I\u2019m not supposed to try and fix stuff. So, I\u2019ve been trying to do anything to fix it, you know. But I thought that, you know, the video was, you know. And, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">know, I think it kind of brought her back a little bit. And because I had asked her earlier in the day, \u201cAm I going to see you tonight?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what my plans are,\u201d you know. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to see her, but, you know, it just pisses me off that she wouldn\u2019t just say, \u201cI <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">don\u2019t want to see you tonight,\u201d you know. I don\u2019t think whatever. So, you know, I\u2019m just having a miserable day. I got to work I had to get done done and just, you know, the kids came over. I\u2019m like all snappy with the kids. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">And just, you know. I don\u2019t know. You know, it seemed like, you know, she said she was going to work. And, you know, I asked, you know, once again I\u2019m with the kid, you know. \u201cDo you want me to come over afterwards?\u201d And the next text was, \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d which was like well that\u2019s a fucking non sequitur <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">if I ever heard one, you know. Are you home just to say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m home,\u201d when you\u2019ve not been communicating to me all of last 48 hours or is it, \u201cHome. Yeah. Come on over.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what it meant. And so, I just ignored it. And, you know, and it ultimately turned out that she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">not in the mood for company tonight,\u201d you know. Something like that. \u201cMaybe tomorrow or whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562184\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">And I was like, you know\u2014I\u2019ve been trying to like hold back and, you know, blame her for anything or, you know, try and make her feel bad or anything like that because I know I\u2019m not going to get anywhere with any of that. But, you know, I said\u2014I didn\u2019t say anything. You know, I didn\u2019t respond. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">so, like 20 minutes later, she goes, \u201cTomorrow maybe?\u201d And I said, \u201cYou tell me\u2026I\u2019m dying over here.\u201d That\u2019s what I put. I\u2019m just, you know, beside myself. I don\u2019t\u2014you know. Just, you know, and then she says, you know, \u201cI will text tomorrow.\u201d And then, you know, later that night she goes, \u201cI hope you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200312\">okay.\u201d And then proceeds to write the, you know, one long text explaining all of what happened and calling Maureen and whatever. And I gave a long, long text back, you know, saying I\u2019m crazy. And she said, \u201cCome over tomorrow. Love you. Good night.\u201d Blah, blah, blah, you know. This is fucking, you know\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s funny because I\u2019m like trying to predict like the next thing that\u2019s just going to knock me down. And I was like, \u201cOh, you know, it\u2019s probably going to be Marcia dumping me for something stupid,\u201d you know. Not to say this was something stupid, but, you know. And then, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">the reality is it\u2019s like\u2014I mean you could say in some respect I was a coward. I just didn\u2019t want to deal with whatever was there and left, you know. But I was just, you know\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have been driving home. That\u2019s for damn sure. I was all fucking, you know, Watertown cop\u2014Watertown cop, Framingham <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200352\">cop. (inaudible) people in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">So, at least I know I can drive drunk. But, you know, I can\u2019t get her to call me back. I can\u2019t, you know\u2014because trying to explain yourself in a paragraph on a Facebook message, you know. And I started realizing that, you know, I\u2019m just\u2014you know, and I just told her. I said, \u201cListen. I\u2019m like in this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">downward spiral. I\u2019m miserable,\u201d you know. I mean this isn\u2019t an excuse, but this, you know who I am. I didn\u2019t want to bring up the fact\u2014you know how she poo poos everything. She poo poos therapy. She poo poos the drugs, you know. She\u2019s doctor done. She\u2019s going to fix everything, you know. Her nephew\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200372\">got bipolar. She\u2019s checked him into all these places, so she knows everything there is to know, you know. And so, I\u2019m trying to relay a very, you know, non-blamatory fashion that maybe you don\u2019t know, you know, exactly what I said, but, you know, just\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you\u2019ve been rolling with this pretty well since it happened actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: (laughter) I\u2019ve been obsessed with it, you know. You know, I don\u2019t know what happened. I was wrong. I\u2019m sorry from the bottom of my heart. What hurts me the most is that it hurt you. You did nothing to deserve this and it shouldn\u2019t happen to someone as sweet as you. And that\u2019s all true, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">know. You know, and, you know, then I\u2019m like I\u2019m not making excuses. Life\u2019s been difficult, you know. I struggle every day, you know. You\u2019re a bright, shining star, you know. I\u2019m much happier when I\u2019m with her, you know. I don\u2019t feel bad, you know. I forgot that, you know. The IRS. You know, we owe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">them instead of thinking it\u2019s going to be about two grand, it was four grand. And I got a 1099, which is going to make it another five to a thousand dollars, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562184\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">And, you know, said, you know, my family sucks. You know, I don\u2019t have a friend I can call at 4:00 a.m. and have them drive over, you know, when I\u2019m wailing, you know. Blah, blah, blah. And, you know, I\u2019m bothered by me here\u2014by my behavior, you know. It\u2019s not me. You know, it\u2019s not me. But it was me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D1\">you know. I miss you and your dog. So, and that\u2019s when I got the, \u201cCome over tonight. Love you. Good night.\u201d And I didn\u2019t even put in one lyric from one song which was pretty amazing on my part. But I\u2019m actually kind of glad there\u2019s going to be a storm tomorrow because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D2\">over there until late tonight. I would have had to go out tonight and I would have had to go out in the morning to court. And, you know, (inaudible 00:16:28) court, you know, it\u2019s my lawyer of the day. Not driving from Watertown to Concord. A blizzard, you know, for tenants who aren\u2019t going to show <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D3\">up for their court date because they\u2019re not going to walk across the street in a blizzard, you know. Oh, man. So, I\u2019m pretty preoccupied with that. I like Klonopin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You seem to have rolled with it. Like I said, I understand you\u2019re preoccupied. You\u2019ve been really upset about it. You\u2019ve been feeling down. You\u2019ve been feeling kind of helpless. But you haven\u2019t really lost your shit. You haven\u2019t, you know, gotten all pissed off and basically stormed out again <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">as far as I can tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: Again. Yeah. Again. You haven\u2019t, you know\u2014or like gotten all pissed off and let her have it. You know you say some stuff you meant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019ve learned my lessons. Some of them, you know. And, you know, I kind of\u2014I learned it from my clients, who are unwilling to settle on principle, you know. And that principle gets you nowhere. It costs you. You know, it costs you. For these people, it might be money, you know. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: I have a piece of it\u2014you know, I never advise\u2014I have a piece of advice. Which is like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Get her flowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: No. That\u2019s not like a bad idea, but that wasn\u2019t what I had in mind. (laughter) I would try like\u2014it seems to me pretty legit and probably a good idea if it\u2014after whatever 11? 12:00 at night or if you\u2019re pretty trashed to just not have conversations about heavy things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I agree, you know. And that was\u2014you know, and I don\u2019t know how to\u2014you know, because we usually don\u2019t, you know. And I don\u2019t know what happened here because, you know, (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: If you were in your right mind, I don\u2019t think it would have gone that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, clearly, she was, you know\u2014but I think what it was is she was really drunk and emotional. You know, that\u2019s the same thing that happened at the wedding, you know. She was drunk and emotional, you know. And\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: Right. I guess you need a way of dealing where of that where it deescalates things rather than\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: You know, and I\u2019ve got, you know\u2014I mean there\u2019s parts where, you know, where I can see, you know, it used to happen like with Jess. You know, it\u2019s here. Have a couple of drinks too many. And, you know, I would take the approach of, \u201cHey, you know, why don\u2019t you slow down. You\u2019re having too drink,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">you know. And which is no good, but with Marcia I just point out her behavior towards me that\u2019s unacceptable. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, okay,\u201d you know and she gets it, you know. But I was caught off guard here, you know. I didn\u2019t even\u2014I was\u2014you know, and\u2014you know, it\u2019s not just that I\u2019ve been drinking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200552\">but, you know, I\u2019m kind of taking a (inaudible 00:20:05), you know. So, I\u2019m exhausted. It\u2019s the staying awake. I\u2019m just so tired, you know. That\u2019s all the meds are doing is making me more tired and more tired, you know.

Is (crosstalk) judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s almost what I did to her. Like I don\u2019t give a shit.

(pause 00:20:51 00:20:59) and I feel like, you know, I\u2019ve got a\u2014can\u2019t change people. This is not going to be an anomaly. At least, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It happens every once in a while with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: And you know it was funny because when I called her and she was setting up for the party, you know\u2014because it\u2019s at the BFW, so they\u2019re giving the, you know\u2014like give him a quarter and they give you seven drinks or whatever, you know. You know, you know, I could already tell she was getting tipsy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">She was like, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d And I\u2019m like\u2014and so, I\u2019m thinking to myself, you know, I was here. You know, is this going to be one of those nights where, you know, she\u2019s just going to be giving shit or getting mad at me? Or, you know, and I said, \u201cWhatever you do, you know, this is her night. This is her <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">party. She\u2019s been very stressed out.

I don\u2019t even remember what time it was when this thing went down. You know, the first start, you know. (pause 00:22:15 00:22:22) So, and there\u2019s one thing, you know\u2014and I don\u2019t know if this plays into it, but, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">know, but I\u2019ve done things many times in my life and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve done them, you know. And I\u2019ve read some literature on depression and that seems to be consistent. And now is not the time to be throwing that up as an excuse. But, you know, I don\u2019t know how to convey to her that, you know, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200672\">is the kind of stuff that I\u2014you can\u2019t ask me why I did something. And, you know\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: What was it that you did to the\u2014I\u2019m a little confused of what you did that was so awful. According to her, I know\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: I think if I stayed everything would have been okay. (pause 00:23:15 00:23:19) But I got up and left because I\u2019m just like, \u201cShe\u2019s out on the couch. I\u2019m fucking in here.\u201d I\u2019m like, you know, super anxious, mad, you know, panoply of emotions. And just I don\u2019t know. I felt like I had to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">out of there, you know. And, you know, I\u2019ve gotten the feeling before, but it\u2019s never really\u2014it\u2019s passing and fleeting, you know. (pause 00:23:48 00:23:55) And I felt, you know\u2014I was glad she finally sent that long text last night because it\u2019s like, you know, this is something I wish you would have\u2014I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B2\">would have known Sunday morning, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562184\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">And I know what I should have done is gotten up Sunday morning, go to the fucking flower shop, (laughter) hop in the car, and drive to Watertown is what I should have done, you know. But instead I just stayed in bed all day. Slept through the Super Bowl. I watched like the first five, ten minutes. A <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">new CI, you know\u2014I knew I was crazy. But I was like, \u201cListen, Seattle\u2019s defense is too good. Defense wins Super Bowls,\u201d you know. They\u2019re going to win this game. I didn\u2019t think they were going to kill them. But, and then I just started seeing that\u2014once that safety hat then I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my god. Peyton.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D2\">You could see the look on Peyton\u2019s face as the ball is going by. It\u2019s just like, \u201cOh, we,\u201d\u2014Peyton has lost. He\u2019s gone, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">But I fell asleep. And I\u2019m just\u2014so, you know, I woke up this morning. I was like, you know, I always send her a good morning text. And I was like, you know, I don\u2019t even feel sending her a good morning text, you know. I even had it preprogrammed in. I hit G M. I text good morning comma. So, I typed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">in G M, erased the comma, and just set the good morning. I don\u2019t know. (pause 00:25:21 00:25:39) And then I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cYou know, she didn\u2019t pay me back the 900 bucks for my car.\u201d (laughter) (coughing) Do I say here? You know, here\u2019s the nonrefundable night. You can take any of your friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F2\">to spend in Hartford and you at least had a reservation. And the meal is not paid for, but, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">(pause 00:26:04 00:26:13) Because like I didn\u2019t know, you know, she would make some statements. \u201cDo you still love me?\u201d \u201cYes. I love you,\u201d you know. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it. I don\u2019t know how I feel any more,\u201d you know. I thought we were at the level or whatever that I could tell you something like this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200711\">you know. And I\u2019ll never be able to convey to her that this has nothing to do with what she said, you know. (pause 00:26:37 00:26:46) And I\u2019m stupid if I ever try. (pause 00:26:47 00:27:04) This is one of those things she\u2019s going to have to figure out on her own, but I\u2019m not going to change her <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200712\">mind about what happened or what she said or what I said or I didn\u2019t know she was behind me when I slammed the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: I mean yea.

That\u2019s her personality. I\u2019ve accepted that, you know. (pause 00:27:27 00:27:56) And I could never, never bring that up, you know. She doesn\u2019t make it easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: No. You never can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: (pause 00:28:04 00:28:16) I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve done everything right, you know.

And, you know, I\u2019m not looking for credit. You know, I enjoy <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">doing it, you know. But, you know, I would think that she would do the same thing for me. But it\u2019s times like this where, you know, I\u2019m looking for a little\u2014built up a little something, you know. The box is done. I can\u2019t use that one again.

And Jess\u2019 all, \u201cI\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200851\">paying the money,\u201d you know. (pause 00:33:38 00:33:50) What happened was is last year we were allowed to take a $40,000 loss for losses in previous years that were disallowed for whatever reason. Well, for some reason last year, we were allowed to take them. And, you know, remove that $40,000 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200852\">we went from, you know, a loss from the rentals to a gain. You know, and that means higher estimated taxes this year. Probably have to pay some state taxes this year which means we\u2019re going to have to pay state estimated taxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">I think we had to pay a dollar in taxes last year.

I was like, \u201cI\u2019ll start paying you child support if you\u2019ll just start working <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200871\">on the separation agreement.\u201d I was like maybe I just have to go ahead and file the fucking, you know, divorce so we got a timeline. (pause 00:35:4100:35:53) I just want to get it over with. I mean Jesus Christ, you know. (pause 00:35:55 00:36:13) I got my mailer that\u2019s going out. I told you about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200872\">my mailer. And, you know, the woman came up with some language in there. And she said things like, you know, prominent changes in the real estate market. And I showed it to Jess and Jess would change it like significant changes. And, you know, and she gave it this sort of editorial, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">THERAPIST: Jess did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I was like oh, you know\u2014and then I look back and I said, \u201cWell, you know, who\u2019s going to be reading this,\u201d you know? A judge, you know. A law school professor. I said no. These are people who are going to read it, boom, you know. And there needs to be words that are going to jump out. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">(coughing) And prominent though definitionally doesn\u2019t\u2014you know, they are prominent changes. Everybody\u2019s seen them. I mean, you know. But I think the word just is more kind of jumps out at you. So, I disregarded all her changes. Left a copy as is. We\u2019ll see how it goes.
