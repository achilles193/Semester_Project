So we went to my parents, first of all, this weekend, and they kind of, like, at one point, they had me come down and talk to me and, basically, it felt like an intervention, like, that they worried about my weight and stuff. And I just sort of like was\u2026I guess felt like they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">were pushing boundaries. Like because they were saying like I should come home at first, and then it was like I\u2019m not doing that. And they were like, okay, you can say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: When you say they were concerned about your weight and stuff, what\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: The pre-diabetic thing and the fact that I haven\u2019t been getting any exercise and that I\u2019ve been depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What feels like the boundary crossing type\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I guess the suggestion they felt that they needed to completely take care of me and stuff. And I\u2019m, I\u2019m like no, I\u2019m an adult. And you know, they can\u2019t be responsible for my weight. Like I\u2019m the only one who can be responsible for my weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[01:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yet in some ways, you\u2019ve been echoing what they\u2019re saying. You have used those same words in here, that you don\u2019t feel like you can take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not disagreeing with you that it felt like a boundary crossing, but I guess I do want to kind of sort out what\u2019s true for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I guess I feel like it should be my call to make and not theirs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Is that what they said, that they want to make the decisions or that they\u2019re worried about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: No, they were like, that sort of went back and then they were like oh no, we don\u2019t actually want you living with us; we\u2019d rather have you living in New Haven. But the fact that they originally proposed me moving back home, like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Because they are worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I think their concerns make sense. You\u2019re worried too. I don\u2019t know what the solution is, but you have certainly expressed that you\u2019re worried about your weight and the impact that that could have on diabetes or developing into that. And you\u2019ve also worried about your ability to make good <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">decisions about taking care of yourself; your ability to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I guess. And then they want me to never go out to eat; like only go out to eat once a week. And I\u2019m like that would mean I\u2019d have to cook the rest of the time and I don\u2019t think I can cook that much. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">[02:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Like I don\u2019t [inaudible \u2013 02:46] trying to cook in a really tiny kitchen. Having to do the dishes with cold water because the hot water runs out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Has that been a repeated problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I\u2026even when I first started out and I can\u2019t get full pressure with the hot water. So maybe there\u2019s just a really small tank and other people are using it. But I have yet to get full pressure with hot water. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">And I\u2019m like I was planning on going country dancing this week and like starting now that I don\u2019t have work and it\u2019s like why did they have to bring stuff up and make me feel worse? Because that\u2019s what it ended up doing. And now I\u2019m like, okay, I\u2019m not going to talk to them ever again. Or if not ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">again, I\u2019m not going to tell them about any weight issues or something I shouldn\u2019t have told them that I was pre-diabetic. I regret it now because they\u2019re just going to use that information against me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561889\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">[03:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: How are they using it against you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: In their campaign to possibly make me come home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. I wonder how we can get you guys on the same team, because in a lot of ways you are. You\u2019re worried about you, they\u2019re worried about you. Your goal is the same. It sounds like your parents want you to be able to make choices that lead to a healthier you, which is also what you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">expressed countless times in here, wanting to be able to make choices that are healthier, but you feel like there are a lot hurdles to doing that. So how can we get them, instead of feeling like it\u2019s a competition, or a battle against each other, how can we get your parents to be something that lower <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">some of those hurdles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean they\u2019re willing to pay for like a gym or something like that, but that\u2019s not going to solve the eating healthily issue, which is\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s not going to solve that one, but one of the things we talked about on Wednesday was how difficult the weather has made it to walk and a gym does solve that problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: If there\u2019s a gym, that\u2019s sort of convenient to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">[05:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Is that something that you could let them be helpful with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I guess. I mean I think I\u2019m going to try the country dancing instead, because it would be more fun that going to the gym.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: In which case I can let them pay for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Sure. If they\u2019re willing to pay for something to give you more activity and you found something that feels more enticing, that sounds like a good solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: If I exercise more, can I not have to do the whole eating healthy thing to like will it be enough to lower my weight? Because I can just, right now it feels like eating healthy isn\u2019t really sustainable. Like it requires more\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: More work than you\u2019re willing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Or like the things that they do, and they\u2019re like, oh yeah, you should like never have sweets ever. I mean just give it up. I mean that\u2019s not sustainable. You know, as soon as I lose the weight I\u2019d go back to eating ice cream and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s too extreme for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">[06:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Or too extreme for anybody to manage long term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just like I guess they\u2019re being really lecturing and like I\u2026 [Tearful.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: So they\u2019re tone makes it really hard to hear the useful parts of their message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s just like you don\u2019t know what\u2019s sustainable for me. Like I know me, myself, you know. I\u2019ve lost weight before. And then as soon as I finish it like, when I was doing Weight Watchers in middle school, high school, like as soon as I stop losing the weight, I stop doing all the measuring <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">the food stuff and you know, not eating junk food and everything not snacking and stuff. And then it all came back over a few years. Like it\u2019s not sustainable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so something that drastic is not sustainable. Something like giving up sweets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I really don\u2019t want to do that if I don\u2019t have to. Because like if that\u2019s the only reason why I lose weight, like as soon as it goes away, which is when I\u2019m like, maybe if I\u2019m exercising more, I can continue to not have to go to the extreme of like calorie counting and stuff. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">if it will work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561889\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: It sounds like really paying attention to finding what are some of the smaller changes that are more sustainable that you\u2019re willing to make. So, you know, eating out only once a week isn\u2019t\u2026is too extreme for you because the idea of having to cook on the other six days is too much. So where <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">is room between what you you\u2019re doing now and that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">[08:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Maybe like trying to eat out like only like three days a week. That\u2019s still a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: How many days a week do you typically eat out now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: At least, almost, every day, for at least one meal. There are many days I be like [inaudible \u2013 08:49].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So there\u2019s a lot of room to cut down, right. So even just making that two days a week that you cook at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot of space for a change; making a change from eating out almost every day to eating out one day is huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to make quite such a leap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, just they were telling me what to do and I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that doesn\u2019t feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: No. [Tearful.] But I didn\u2019t really have a good counter argument at the time. My argument against not eating out is like Sydney won\u2019t like that. It\u2019s like, oh well, we don\u2019t care. You should care about yourself more. Like it took me to later to think wait a second. No. The reason why I\u2019m really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">against that is because then I\u2019ll have to cook all the time and do all the dishes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it feels like too much work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Which is why they are concerned about you being able to live on your own, because those things feel like too much work, and those are basic necessities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: And now I\u2019m just kicking myself for getting an apartment without a dishwasher. And I think if I had a dishwasher it would be a lot easier and it wouldn\u2019t be as much of a hurdle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well it certainly makes dishes easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t change the cooking. And it doesn\u2019t really change the prep, the time, which is another hurdle, I think, that we\u2019ve identified is having to go to the grocery store, think ahead about what to make or buy. Having that stuff on hand; that felt like a big challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">[10:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah. It still does. My kitchen still is not really set up for like buying lots of groceries in advance and having them there. I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m like, maybe I should have [inaudible \u2013 11:05] problems. I guess, I don\u2019t know. Like I don\u2019t know how I could have avoided all this. I don\u2019t, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">like, you know, living on my own and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t seem like looking backwards is going to help. Let\u2019s figure out sort of you are here now, making good decisions going forward. You know, you can\u2019t change what\u2019s already happened, but you are in a place, in terms of what you\u2019re eating, what your daily habits are, that isn\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">working for you. So what decisions can we make now to have that be healthier for you; feel better mentally and physically? You don\u2019t have to make the same choices that have been problematic in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

That\u2019s how, like, well, we have on the Wiki, usually a document that like lists all the rehearsals for the semester and then people write their name if they\u2019re like not going to be there for that rehearsal. So I told them that I\u2019d be missing a few rehearsals, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">but I didn\u2019t have the actual dates for those yet.

A part of me is afraid that like maybe all my love for him is completely gone. Like I want to stay with him, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my depression or what, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">but I\u2019m starting to get really scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Scared?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: That maybe I shouldn\u2019t be in the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: What do you feel for him?

What do you feel for him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: I enjoy being around him and stuff, but like I don\u2019t feel that deep passion and I don\u2019t feel like, you know, complete like when he\u2019s upset, I don\u2019t feel like, usually I\u2019m annoyed at him for doing something and, you know, like I don\u2019t rush in to comfort him like I should. Like that\u2019s how I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">be feeling. It\u2019s just been so long that like, you know, and like we haven\u2019t a functional sex life for like a year, more than a year. And so I think I like retreated when that happened and I don\u2019t know. Like I know the like warm and fuzzy feelings that like starts off a relationship fades, but I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D32\">know what love is anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">[16:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: You guys have been in a challenging position for a really long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just afraid that it\u2019s not going to work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s kept you together this long?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess the fact that we think we\u2019re good for each other. Like each other\u2019s company and are good companions and stuff. Possibly in our shadow or the fact that he really loves me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re not sure you really love him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">[17:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: When did you start questioning that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: A few days ago. Like I guess last week. I guess on my birthday when I got really upset, because I came back from therapy and we were going to go out to dinner and like he\u2019d been panicking all day because I guess it was my fault for starting off the day with like getting annoyed with him, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">the night before, that it was like staying up all night. And I\u2019m like tomorrow is my birthday. We need to go to sleep. And I was going to sleep and like, and he was still up at like 3:00 a.m. or something. And so that he was panicking later in the day and like I had\u2026and after therapy I came back and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E72\">ended up getting the car. Like I thought it was like shoveled out enough to be [inaudible \u2013 17:48] and it was just no way and I couldn\u2019t get out and he didn\u2019t help me. And like he wouldn\u2019t, because he was panicking. And at that point I was just like really frustrated and I\u2019m like, okay, well if I break <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E73\">up with you, then I don\u2019t have this problem anymore because it\u2019s your car and I don\u2019t have to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561889\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You were thinking that or you said that out loud to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: I was thinking it and then I said it. Which is really cruel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I was only asking to understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: He eventually did come down and help me. Like it felt like I had to go back to the apartment to like get him and the car was like half out and I couldn\u2019t. It was like I can\u2019t leave the car like this. And just the fact that he didn\u2019t come down to help me just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">[18:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you felt abandoned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, and like it\u2019s my birthday. And then like that night, like I had a glass of water on the night stand that I knocked over onto the bed and like he\u2026I was having trouble falling asleep and like was keeping him up out of spite. I was just so pissed off at him. Then the water. And I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F51\">well, if I break up with you, then how then you couldn\u2019t go home and then I could use the other side of the bed. I was just, you know\u2026which also was really really cruel. I mean we didn\u2019t end up breaking up, but then the next day he broke down and we talked and I apologized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: When you said those things, did you really want to break up with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: Like I wasn\u2019t panicking and feeling like, oh no, I\u2019m going to lose him. I was thinking that this was a better solution and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Because you wanted to end the relationship or because you wanted to use the other side of the bed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: Because I wanted to use the other side of the bed but apparently didn\u2019t care enough about the relationship to think, you know, that I thought it was worth sacrificing in order to use the other side of the bed and\/or not have to deal with the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">[20:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: It seems like, you know, making a decision about whether or not you want to end the relationship is a decision you want to make based on whether or not you want to be in the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: Rather than using the relationship to solve another problem. And what I\u2019m hearing is, you know, I don\u2019t know whether or not you want to end the relationship. That\u2019s, I think, hat is a big question that you need to figure out. You know, and it\u2019s based more on whether or not you love him than <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201051\">on whether or not there\u2019s an immediate problem. So both of those situations in the past couple of days were immediate problems that, yeah, it would be solved by breaking up with him, but then what happens after that. It\u2019s similar to wanting to kill yourself to end the panic. Yeah, that would work. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201052\">would stop the panic. But then it also has a host of other consequences. It ends everything else, too, right. It sounds like similar types of thinking kind of like overly dramatic solutions to an immediate problem. The question of whether or not you want to be in the relationship is an important question. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201053\">But it\u2019s not about whether or not there\u2019s spilled water on the bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561889\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: No, but the fact that I\u2019ve cared so little about the relationship enough to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: Do you really care so little about the relationship, or did you care so little about the relationship in that moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">[21:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: I guess, possibly.

And I guess my question is the fact that you\u2019re getting there, is that about the relationship or is that your general thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean I haven\u2019t thought of it before today. I guess it could be my general thinking style\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: Applied to a new content area. When I think about your responses to other problems, the line of thinking sounds similar to me, right. Like it\u2019s a similar line of thinking to the kitchen is too small and it\u2019s hard to cook, so I should move to my parent\u2019s house. Right. The big, big changes <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">for a smaller\u2026that does solve a smaller problem, but it\u2019s like a big response to a more contained issue. It\u2019s hard to separate and now you\u2019re thinking about the relationship and it\u2019s hard to separate, well, is this because you\u2019re tending to think about these big solutions to more contained issues, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201132\">is it really an indicator about the relationship and the health of the relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">[23:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s think about it. I mean removed from, there\u2019s no immediate crisis right now, like a car or being stuck or birthday plans being canceled. So this is sort of a time to really explore what the relationship means to you and what you feel for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: And how much, like what does stuff feel like? How do I know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: What does it feel\u2026does it feel different than before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just it happened so gradually that I don\u2019t know. [Tearful.] The very beginning, I was all really excited to like, you know, there was this wonderful new guy and we\u2019re going to do all these fun things together and he\u2019s, you know, we get along really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: Are those things still true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: We get along when we\u2019re not fighting. Like he\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: How often is that? What\u2019s the ratio of getting along well to fighting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: We fight at least a couple of times a week. And then just all of his panic and inability to deal with life just makes it so much harder. And then I feel like sometimes I\u2019ve depending on him when I shouldn\u2019t be. And then he doesn\u2019t follow through. And like, you know. Or he creates problems for <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201271\">me. Even like last night, like he had a salad while I was at rehersal and like he never did the dishes from it. And then he didn\u2019t do the dishes again today. And then I was like, I don\u2019t want to have like all the dishes in the sink after everyone\u2019s\u2026I ended up going out to eat. But I had been planning <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201272\">on having, making pasta for lunch, but I was like I can\u2019t do this until the dishes are done, and you know, which meant that either he couldn\u2019t do the dishes and he was panicking and then it was like I was going to have to do his dishes like [inaudible \u2013 25:25] and then. Just feels, you know, but I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201273\">not like, oh, this is like, you know, he\u2019s doing really badly. I\u2019m going to do the dishes for him because I care about him so much.

And that\u2019s not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">CLIENT: But I shouldn\u2019t get mad at him because the panic is just the way he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">[28:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really hard not to have a response when you feel continually disappointed or thwarted in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: I can certainly see why it feels bad on both ends for you to be angry when he\u2019s hurting in some way. But I also feel that it\u2019s unfair to say that you\u2019re poisonous or toxic because of a response that you\u2019re having that seems pretty normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: But then he gets like really sad when I\u2019m mad at him and it just makes it worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yes, he does get really upset when you\u2019re angry.

You both bear responsibility for the reactions that you both have and the behaviors that you have in response to one another. It can\u2019t be all your responsibility <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D1\">or all his. And dealing with illness in a relationship is a really challenging thing.

You can\u2019t; you can\u2019t be given responsibility for how he responds to things, or the choices that he makes. He has to have responsibility for that in the same way that you have to take responsibility for your choices. So when you say something like, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t eat\u2026I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F1\">cook dinner because he did this.\u201d That\u2019s placing unfair responsibility on him. That\u2019s you making a choice based on, you know, something else. And to say that you\u2019re not responsible for him missing his session. He\u2019s the one that didn\u2019t go. That\u2019s him being responsible for missing his session. He may <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F2\">be upset about something that happened, but his choice is to say, \u201cI\u2019m upset.

I can\u2019t stop your panic. You can\u2019t stop his. If I could stop, if somebody could stop another person\u2019s panic, they would just fix it. But it\u2019s not that easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: But people can induce other people\u2019s panic.

And you\u2019re right. There are\u2026having a fight with you, for sure, is going to be something that makes him more <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201951\">susceptible to panicking. It might be a trigger for a panic attack. But it\u2019s not your sole responsibility to avoid those things. He has to also take responsibility in the same way that I ask you to take responsibility for taking care of your health in thinking about thinking in ways that are adaptive <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201952\">for you and avoiding thought patterns that elicit more panic. But he can\u2019t control your thoughts. You have to control them.

I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not completely convinced. I still think it\u2019s my fault. Even if it wasn\u2019t, I mean he still missed the appointment and there was nothing I could do about it at that point. And\u2026he <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A51\">was panicking and then he wanted like\u2026and I was at work and I was doing something. I didn\u2019t say something until like another 15 minutes and then it was like too late for him to leave, so I couldn\u2019t try to calm him down over talking on the Internet. And so I don\u2019t know if me trying to calm him down would <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A52\">have made it so he could have gone to the appointment, but he didn\u2019t go and it just bothers me so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019re angry for not going.

Then he told himself that I was angry at him for it and I was like, oh, you\u2019re making it all about you. But like I\u2019ve been dealing with the consequences of his panic for the past two years. That\u2019s really exhausting. I think he needs a new psychiatrist who actually will get [inaudible \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A91\">37:15] and stuff and that would be even more panic inducing for him having to find a new psychiatrist while being this upset.

And if you can try to separate those, so not making yourself dependent\u2026not <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF1\">making it dependent on whether he can follow through on something for you to go do something. And you want to get up and leave the house and get out, not feeling like you have to wait for him to be ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\">THERAPIST: If he can\u2019t be ready at the time that you planned, then go on your own. It\u2019s not the same experience as having done something with him, but it might be a little bit less limiting and that might help with the resentment that you feel. If you don\u2019t feel like all of your choices are tied to <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201F31\">him, some of the resentment that you feel might come down a bit. And if you can give that a go, maybe that will help decrease the sort of the negative cycle that you guys are in; that more resentful you feel, the less empathic you can be to him. The more he limits you, the more resentful you feel. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201F32\">you see how it goes around?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">CLIENT: Uh huh. That means he doesn\u2019t like it when I feel like, you know, his panic is tied to what I can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">THERAPIST: He doesn\u2019t like that either?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">CLIENT: He doesn\u2019t like it either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">THERAPIST: So what, maybe you can untie that a little bit. You can be independent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">[46:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">THERAPIST: And it might not be your wish, but it might be better than being resentful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think I need to like get in tuned to a group or something like that. I asked today about there is something, you know, last night about volunteering\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">THERAPIST: Oh you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t heard back yet. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll take her a few days or if she\u2019s waiting because the answer is no or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">THERAPIST: Well, let\u2019s see what the answer is before you guess. It sounds like you\u2019ve taken a couple of really good steps to get yourself more involved with other things that would be enjoyable. Yeah. Going back to music. I hope you will go take advantage of the dancing tonight. See what you get back <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202091\">in response about that e-mail you just sent. Those are all really healthy steps, I think. So let\u2019s see\u2026let\u2019s see if those take hold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t we wrap up there for today. We\u2019re on for our regular time next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020F\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20211\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll see you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20213\">[END OF AUDIO.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20215\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
