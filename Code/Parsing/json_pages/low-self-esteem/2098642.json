No, I just realized that was right. I've got what I thought was going to be a crazy day Thursday. I've got small claims in the morning. God knows when I'm going to get out of there. I'm supposed to have a closing and another closing; but the second closing, I'm just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">showing up and taking the buyer his documents. I don't really have to prep for anything. As it turns out, the closing they want to close first thing Thursday morning so they can send a wire out. It's a short sale. Now they're asking if we can come in late on Wednesday to sign, which is fine with me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">Then I got the closing instructions finally for the closing on Thursday, and they want 72 hours to schedule, which pushes it to Friday. I think my clients would wind up moving trucks and all this crap.  I'm kind of hoping that we close on Friday. I would hate to get the documents Thursday morning and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">try and scramble. I need to at least ask if there's something we can do, that way I can tell my client in advance. It makes me feel like I'm busy because I have a busy Thursday, but I'm really not that busy. I got in the office yesterday and did work and putzed around a bit. I'm still being productive <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">at least.  I got a text from Dr. Grace on Friday that this other woman is going and am I still going? I'm like, \"Sure.\" Later I get another text that she is not going. \"Are you still going?\" I'm like, \"Sure.\" Her response was, \"Awesome.\" I got up there and she asked me if I wanted a beer or something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">and she offered me some crappy beer like Shock Top. Have you ever heard of Shock Top? It's like one of these big-brewery micro-brews and it's awful. I stated how I thought it was awful and she was like, \"Yeah. This is my boyfriend's.\" She had been dating a guy, but broke up. Apparently, they're back <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">together. At least we had fun. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) I don't know. I got jury duty in [error.] (ph?) I just feel like I'm being punished for something, beating my son. I don't beat him, I just make him cry every so often. I'm a little \u2013 you know? He's fragile. He wants to roughhouse. If he gets smacked, then he gets upset. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">The worst part was that I had a good time. She's actually cooler than I thought she was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Why \"good?\" It was funny because. (bell tone) That could be an Amber Alert. No \u2013 my team is full rested. They're getting out. (chuckles) I said that I was old and she's 34. I'm going to be 43. She was like, \"Oh, no. We're the same age.\" So every time I would say anything negative, she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">say, \"No, you're normal,\" or whatever. Then she never referred to her boyfriend by name. She would just say, \"My boyfriend,\" which I thought was odd.  I don't know if there's some psychological thing there. (sighs) So... back to the drawing board. I was feeling less anxious when I heard Maureen was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">going, then she was like, \"Maureen is not going.\" Then I wasn't as anxious as before, for some reason. What did I have? Oh, yeah, vodka tonic, whatever, took care of that pretty much. (pause)  You're speechless? You don't know what to think of it. You're trying to find some positive in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098642\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: No. (pause) I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: You're rapidly blinking your eyes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I do that when I'm thinking a lot, usually without realizing it until somebody points it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: If you get everything to me today, we can close on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I think you're feeling kind of on the spot here, as well as with Dr. Grace \u2013 here because you have kind of mixed feelings about how you did. In a way I think you feel sort of \u2013 I kind of have a sense you feel you sort of screwed up or were a loser because you didn't hook up with her, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">neither of us thinks is realistically true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: No, it's just another one of these \"victim of circumstance\" sort of things where it's totally beyond my control, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: One curious thing to me is that I think it went fine. It was nice to hang out, you guys had a good time, it could have been awkward, you know? She could have canceled, you could have bailed, there could have been a bunch of people; but it wasn't. It was just the two of you and it actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">went pretty well and you had a pretty good time together. And given that you, I think, worry that you're going to crash and burn in a situation like that, it actually went pretty well. It wasn't actually dating somebody and you guys didn't hook up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I wasn't expecting to hook up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Given that and that she's dating somebody, how could it have gone better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: She wouldn't be dating someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That's not about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: No, but I feel...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's not like I was devastated or anything like that. It just surprised me that something like that \u2013 you know. At least I avoided any further rejection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: \"Further?\" When was there initial rejection? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Any rejection, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I guess what is striking me is how you seem kind of anxious and self-conscious and as though you feel on the spot talking about it when, in fact, your performance was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I'm not worried about my performance, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: What are you worried about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: It's not worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: You seem anxious. Maybe I'm misreading it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I don't know. To me it's like it went wrong. That's how I feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I see. How did it go wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Because she's dating someone, the boyfriend who has no name. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Beer, but no name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he drinks crappy beer. Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So can you explain that to me? How her having a boyfriend means it went wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I didn't even get an opportunity to \u2013 I don't know what one says in these situations \u2013 ask her out again or follow up; that whole like of action was made moot. I can go out on a Friday night and drink and have fun all the time. I don't have to drive there to get rejected \u2013 not that I was rejected, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">but there's no difference in my opinion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see. So you're saying that you're much more focused on the outcome than what you did. Like what you care about is that, in a way, she's off the market, it's not going to happen, and you were hoping otherwise. And your anxiety maybe has more to do with excitement, disappointment, your expectations...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: It would have been better if there were things that she did that bothered me or things she said that bothered me or I had found some little... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098642\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Right but, actually, you were kind of into her, so it's terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. (both chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Maybe you're a little self-conscious about being into her, knowing that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: It's not self-consciousness, it's just that \u2013 I don't know \u2013 I'm waiting for something to happen to me or for me or whatever, and it doesn't seem to be moving in that direction. I don't know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And that's kind of your life \u2013 that things aren't moving in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's frustrating, depressing; but I have all these meds, so I'm not really depressed. Were I not on the meds, I would feel depressed. (sighs) I forgot to mention that Micah upped my Prozac. I'm now taking 40 mg a day. (pause)  What's on your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I've heard that somewhere before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: (pause)  There's one woman who was going out with a guy, had a boyfriend who lived with her, a total dork. It just seemed weird that she was going out with this guy who was a dork; it was just strange. The last I spoke with her it seemed like they were breaking up but, you know... Nothing. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">I don't think I would ask her out or anything like that. (pause)  Other than that, yeah, I don't have any prospects \u2013 realistic prospects. (pause)  You've got to be thinking about something. Something like a question to move the conversation along.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: I wonder why you're stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I don't know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I wonder if the dating thing has maybe got you down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Or lack, thereof. (pause)  It's the same. I'm just alone, bored out of my mind sometimes. I've actually done a slight amount of cleaning. I took down some recyclables yesterday. I've got a long way to go. (pause)  Ian had a birthday party on Saturday. Someone gave him a poker set. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: To which Jess said, \"That's age inappropriate.\" He always wants to play the Texas Hold \u2018em game on my phone, but I'm like \u2013 you know. I didn't want to get into explaining it to him. I texted on Sunday, \"What are the kids up to?' She was like, \"We're going out to my parents.\" I was like, \"That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">too bad. I wanted to teach Ian how to play poker.\" To which, once again, she replied that it's age inappropriate. I was like, \"What if he's a child prodigy?\" (chuckles) I didn't get a response to that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) Your financial woes could be ended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: There's big money in the World Series of Poker. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're in over your head with dating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: (sniggers) Not really because I'm not doing it. (both chuckle) (pause) I'm thinking that you'd agree that poker is age inappropriate for a seven year old. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I think that's something that is what you and Jess are comfortable with. I would say that online poker or betting real money poker is age inappropriate; but insofar as a card game, I don't think it's necessarily bad. I think it's most importantly what you guys feel comfortable with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: (pause)  It was weird. Last night there were five episodes of Criminal Minds on back-to-back. In the midnight episode, Jason Alexander was the serial killer, but I was so tired I just went to sleep. I had convinced myself earlier that out of all the episodes shown, that was the one I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">to see. I feel that at some point I'll get to see it. I didn't know if that was losing interest in things I enjoy or just being tired. I was up at like 6:00. I'm sleeping like six hours. I don't know if that's bad or good. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098642\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It's not a lot.

I'm staying up relatively late.

But I wasn't completely surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I think you did know it was going to be something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

With other things, like with work, it's not like you sound triumphant, but you usually sound kind of ambiguous \"It feels like I'm busy, but I'm not really busy.\" You know. That's not real positive, but not real negative either. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">dating, I think, you feel much more pessimistic about. That's my impression. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: It reminds me of a joke. You know the Little Johnny jokes? The little kid in the back of the classroom that the teacher is always calling on? She tells the class that tomorrow she'd like everyone to dress up as their favorite emotion. The next day comes and she asks people if they want to share <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">their emotion. Little Billy stands up and he's dressed as a blueberry. He says, \"It's blue and I'm sad.\" \"Very good, Billy. I'm sorry you're sad, but that's very good.\" By the way, it's supposed to be a fruit. It's supposed to be your favorite fruit emotion. (both laugh) So Sally dresses as a banana <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A12\">\u2013 yellow \u2013 lack of courage. You know \u2013 that kind of vehicle. The green, he's horny. The red, cheery \u2013 you know how it goes. So they go through all the kids in the classroom and here's little Johnny in the back of the classroom. The teacher is just like, \"(sigh) All right, Johnny. What have you got?\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A13\">So Johnny stands up and takes off his trench coat and he's naked. He has a pear on his penis. \"Johnny, what emotion is that?\" (both chuckle) He goes, \"Isn't it obvious? Fucking despair.\" (both laugh)  That's what I think of when the word \"despair\" comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Little Johnny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right. Fucking despair. Freud wrote a paper about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098642\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Did he? What was the name used?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: That jokes are funny because they provide social outlet for forbidden wishes and thoughts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: So that allows me to work \"fucking despair\" into the conversation without just saying, \"Fucking despair;\" and people thinking, \"That's inappropriate,\" as opposed to, \"Oh, that's part of the joke.\" On Criminal Minds they claim that Freud's view or theories or whatever on dream analysis are bunk, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">that they've been disproven somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: No, not really. The evidence from studies is actually pretty consistent. It doesn't validate all the elements of Freud's study of dreams, but it's actually pretty consistent with most of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: I don't often remember my dreams. I assume I am dreaming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, most people dream. (pause) I think there is something quite poignant and quite particular about the \"fucking despair\" joke relates to you. I actually think it's very sad. I think there are ways you feel like that's often what you've come to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: I thought you were going to say you thought it was funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I did also think it was funny. I did think it was funny; but I also thought it was sad. And I think for you it's probably a lot like a dream. That's a pretty good joke, actually. I mean it's got the three elements \u2013 the feeling of hopelessness, the lack of confidence and making a joke out <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">of the whole thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Some self-deprecating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: (sighs) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Remember in a hospital a while ago somebody made a fuss about self-esteem and how you thought that was sort of a narcissistic issue like self-esteem? Getting pretty close to the root of the depression trouble you were having?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: If you say so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: You asked me about it at the time, like, \"Here it is, right there in the joke.\" (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: The name of the band eludes me right now, but there is a song about low self-esteem. You know \u2013 \"I'm just a sucker with low self-esteem.\" His girlfriend, who is sleeping with all of his friends, is just using him for sex and then I'm like, \"Well, at least he's getting used for sex.\" Offspring <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">is the band. (sighs) I feel a little more anxious than when I came in here. I wasn't feeling very anxious when I came in here. I don't know if I should blame you or \u2013 you don't care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, I imagine you do.
