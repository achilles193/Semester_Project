And the plan had been for him to drive back and drop me off at therapy, so I had to drive all the way back to drop him off since he was so panicky that even if I had dropped him off at the subway that wouldn\u2019t have worked for him and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">I\u2019d come back through the Square. So that\u2019s why I thought I was going to be late because I wasn\u2019t sure how long that drive would take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Well I appreciate the heads up and glad you\u2019re here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Take (ph) a couple deep breaths. I mean, it sounds like you ran from your parking spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t that bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Or walked fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And also I chose to walk up the stairs. That\u2019s probably why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a healthy choice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I finally ended up going dancing two out of the three nights last week because Monday after therapy I hit a really bad pot hole and it gave me a flat tire. And the tires were all worn down anyways so I was like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll replace them all.\u201d And then waiting for all that work to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">done ended up \u2013 like I had a little bit of time I could have gone to dancing but it would have required missing dinner and I was just so worn out I\u2019m like, \u201cScrew it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you went twice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: But I went Wednesday and Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: How was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: It was good. I realized I actually forgot a lot about dancing and so felt a little bit self-conscious about my lack of dancing skills, but yeah. It was good. The other problem with dancing is just it\u2019s like kind of awkward asking people to dance or waiting for them to ask you to dance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s partnered. So did you do dancing both nights?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Well, Wednesday was swing and Thursday was Contra. Monday is also Contra because the swing dancing is once a week (inaudible at 00:02:21) for free. But I think it\u2019s definitely helping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Helping in what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: In like, my mental health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay. Hoping that the activity would sort of serve that purpose as well as helping you kind of expend some calories for the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I\u2019m getting a little bit better about walking and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: This weekend was a little less brutally cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, when I danced on Wednesday\u2014well, even after the first dance my legs started hurting and I sort of did maybe every two out of three dances and then I walked back to the car. And it took forever for me to get back to the car because I was walking so slowly because my legs had hurt <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">so much and I realized when I got to my car that I had forgotten my hat. I could go back and try to get it but it would have been really really painful to do that walk again and by the time I got back everything would have been over anyways and I might not have been able to get into the room. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">So the fact that I wasn\u2019t really that bothered by losing my hat, even though it was one that I knitted myself. The fact that I was fine with that is a good sign that my mental health is improving. So now I\u2019m just making myself a new hat instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Have you called to see if maybe it was there?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I e-mailed the person who organized the dance, who never got back to me, and I also e-mailed my friend at Stanford, like asked if the student center had a lost and found and she wasn\u2019t sure. There\u2019s apparently a police office in the basement but apparently it\u2019s not open that often and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">know if they would handle lost and found or what. So it seems like it might be a little more effort than it\u2019s worth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re able to sort of put it in perspective and problem-solve it and move on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I was going to have to knit a new hat anyways because that one wasn\u2019t going to last more than one winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: So it made it almost the whole season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I had it for like five years or something (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow. So lots of seasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Basically, last winter my scarves were all wearing away and this year it\u2019s the hat. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be cold for that much longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Hopefully not. And you have the skills to make another one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, I\u2019m feeling better. I mean, I think just not having the job. So it probably was the commute that was doing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. The commute was difficult for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. Now I still need to find a new job and I did apply to two jobs last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Good for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t have much of a chance because I\u2019m sort of over-qualified for both of them. One of them I was way more over-qualified for than the other and the one I liked better was the one that I was less over-qualified for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: What were these opportunities?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: They were both at Yale. One was an assistant and that was the one that I think\u2014I forget if that was the one I was over-qualified for more or not. Like one of them was part-time, like 17.5 hours a week and the other one was full time and that one was helping with running the reading room and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">stuff like that. Definitely something I\u2019m capable of doing. I don\u2019t know whether or not they\u2019ll write me back since it\u2019s Yale and sometimes they never get back to you ever. Or only at the very end, like several months later to tell you that you didn\u2019t get the job. So, I\u2019m not expecting too much from it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: But I think it\u2019s a good sign that you felt motivated enough to apply because you had felt really panicky and really stuck the last few times I had seen you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: And I even did it from my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been in the apartment for the past week and I\u2019m no longer freaking out about how small my apartment is and stuff. So it wasn\u2019t the apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you\u2019re feeling much more upbeat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: So how are you managing in your apartment? If you\u2019re spending more time there this past week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:07:07) We\u2019re still eating out a lot of the time just because we don\u2019t have the energy to cook and do dishes all the time, which isn\u2019t great but it is what it is. I\u2019ve still been putting off doing things like laundry and stuff until the last minute, but I feel able to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So it feels less like you can\u2019t and more like you don\u2019t want to right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or I don\u2019t have time today. I\u2019ve been making it out of the house almost every day. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad to hear that things feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Sort of heard that if I do get a job my social life will disappear again and I won\u2019t be able to continue dancing and (inaudible at 00:08:01) I\u2019m not going to apply to anything with an unreasonable commute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well, (inaudible at 00:08:06) down the commute certainly would make it more possible to fit work and something social in the evening. Especially a part-time position. Maybe there would be some days you would feel too taxed, but it would give you time on other days. It seems like that\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">of a bridge to cross when you get interviews and offers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which might not be for a really long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come of these positions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve got a (inaudible at 00:08:37) volunteering at the zoo again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Doing (ph) what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: I\u2019d e-mailed last week and it took her a couple days to get back to me and first she was like, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Her assistant had been out sick and she was also hiring a new student worker, so she had a bunch of other things to do and wasn\u2019t sure that there would be time and space for me to volunteer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">And then I think it was even the next day that she wrote me back and was like, \u201cOh, you actually know how to do the (inaudible at 00:09:07) programing thing. How about working on this project?\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, that sounds awesome.\u201d So I need to e-mail her and figure out what day of the week I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">going to be working, but I might be starting as early as this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Wow. So how much time is that commitment for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s going to be\u2014if it\u2019s anything like the previous times I\u2019ve volunteered there like one day a week for a four hour block or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Okay. So pretty minimal, but it does keep you connected and gives you another project of experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: And it won\u2019t leave the gap on my resume. So yeah, that\u2019s a (ph) big thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you\u2019ve taken some really good steps, Georgia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just still not living as up to the healthy eating as much as I might like to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Okay. It sounds like you\u2019ve got some momentum going here by taking some good healthy steps. Maybe not specifically focused on the eating, but some other ways of taking care of yourself. I think being able to get some applications out there, being able to make the contact about volunteering, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">being able to get out and go dancing again, and you reach back out to a community that you enjoy being a part of. Those are all really good ways of taking care of yourself because you are more than just calories in calories out. Taking care of your mental health and your emotional well-being is important <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B2\">too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">So now that you\u2019ve got some momentum going, and doing those things it sounds like is reinforcing because you enjoyed the dancing and you got a good response from the person at the zoo. So maybe that will give you some motivation to make another kind of healthy choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: I guess with the food I\u2019m just doing it in small steps because my parents were sort of ridiculous with that. They wanted me to cut out all soda. Well, not just soda. Soda I could cut out, but they didn\u2019t even want me to drink juice, and I\u2019m like, \u201cJuice has fruits in it and I know it has calories <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">in it, but I\u2019m not going to only drink water.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well it sounds like your parents\u2019 expectation was coming from a good place. They\u2019re concerned about you, but it feels too extreme for you. Too controlling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Like okay. I can understand not having real ice cream, but they didn\u2019t even want me to be eating the Weight Watchers low calorie ice cream bars. And I\u2019m just like, \u201cNo.(Chuckles) I am not giving up all sweets like you guys do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Is that what they do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Well, they\u2019ve given up all pastries and cookies and cakes. Once a week they\u2019ll have, lunch with everybody else. They\u2019ll have (inaudible at 00:12:02) ice cream, which is made of soy or something like that. Or possibly coconut milk. Other times for dessert they\u2019ll just have clementines or pistachio <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">nuts or something like that. They don\u2019t eat sweets now and I\u2019m just like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t fit for you. And certainly making a move toward heathier eating doesn\u2019t need to be quite so extreme. It doesn\u2019t need to be under their rule. I can see you reacting to them kind of wanting to step in\u2014in a couple of ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">One, it feels like an unrealistic expectation, but also when you talked about it last week, just having them kind of step in and express their concern and give you some ideas without crossing a boundary. What you decide to do needs to be your decision. We can certainly talk about options in here, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">anything you choose to do really needs to be your choice or it\u2019s not going to be something you\u2019ll stick with if you feel like it\u2019s somebody imposing something on you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And what I\u2019m trying to do is maybe every other time that I would be getting soda, not get soda so I won\u2019t be having soda half as much as I would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: When you get a soda, what size do you usually get?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Like, it\u2019s at a restaurant so it\u2019ll be like a can of soda or sometimes it\u2019s a 20 oz. bottle and sometimes a glass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I mean, one way of cutting back is sort of making things smaller, serving sizes. But that\u2019s hard to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. You can\u2019t do that at restaurants. Yeah. I have no clue what size those sodas are and there wasn\u2019t an order (inaudible at 00:13:51).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Sometimes if you get a small or large, but that\u2019s not available every place. Yeah. So maybe that idea of kind of thinking about what you would typically do and making another choice some of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess I could go back to drinking diet soda. It\u2019s just that usually I like Root Beer or Orange Soda. They don\u2019t usually have diet Root Beer or diet Orange Soda in restaurants. Most of the time at home I\u2019m not drinking soda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s one place where you can cut back a little bit. Where are other places that feel reasonable to you to make small changes that are sustainable? I know a long time ago we had kind of looked at what your typical week of eating was like and I don\u2019t know how much that\u2019s the same or different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Well, I guess it\u2019s pretty much the same. I\u2019ve been trying to eat more clementines and stuff. I guess I can cut down, especially at my place the bowls are really small so a bowl of pasta is less than it used to me. And usually I\u2019m not getting seconds on that but sometimes I am when I\u2019m really hungry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Have you ever measured it so you know like what\u2019s a bowl at your house is at a cup, a half a cup?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: It would definitely be more than half a cup. It\u2019s probably a cup. [Even if it\u2019s] (ph) less than a cup. Yeah. I don\u2019t actually know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You know, I think the idea of measuring your food every time you eat is unrealistic. It also sets you up for, rather than paying attention to your physical cues, paying attention to something else to determine how much you want to eat. But doing it now, since you have new dishes, filling <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">your dish the way you typically would and then measuring it just to get a sense of what the serving size is, and then not measuring anymore. Just so you can get a sense of what does my serving of pasta usually look like? How does that correlate to what the suggested serving size is? So that you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B32\">get a sense of how much you\u2019re eating when you serve yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: So stick with what typical is for you and then (inaudible at 00:16:28) getting some information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: I went to the doctor and he said apparently I\u2019ve lost a pound since December. And I think that\u2019s actually more because I think I gained more weight. There was one appointment that I had my snow boots on and I didn\u2019t really feel like getting weighed and asked if I could get out of getting weighed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">and they were like, \u201cOh, sure. That\u2019s fine.\u201d But I think that I had actually gained more weight and so I guess I lost that weight too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So maybe headed in a direction towards health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because even if I\u2019m just like become more in shape, that\u2019ll be fine. And the doctor said I only have to lose five to ten pounds. That would be enough to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: To make a difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then I won\u2019t be pre-diabetic anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And I know that really the goal is to lose weight to take you out of that pre-diabetic area that is scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:17:27) the pre-diabetic thing is going down. Like you want to be 5.6 or below and the first time they measured me was 5.8 and the second time was 5.7.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: But what is that measurement of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Blood sugar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Blood sugar. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it\u2019s the molecules tools (ph) that attach to something. It\u2019s like [not done fasting] (ph) and actually, they want to test me again fasting (ph) but not until May.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a couple months away. So a realistic goal might be to lose, between now and May, being able to lose that five to ten pounds. Ten would be a little much. You know, losing weight slowly is more sustainable than trying to take off a number of pounds at once. So thinking about losing two <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">to three pounds in a month is a nice slow reasonable goal that you can obtain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m not sure whether or not it would be a good idea for breakfast to switch over to doing this (inaudible 00:18:41) shake thing for breakfast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s a typical breakfast now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: A typical breakfast either is wake up at noon and get lunch (chuckles) or if Sydney is also up we might go to Dunkin Donuts and I\u2019ll get a bagel and coffee for the day that it was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Anything on your bagel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Cream Cheese. Usually I use less than half of the container of Cream Cheese that they give me and the container is this big and this tall. And sometimes it\u2019s rice cakes and cream cheese if I\u2019m at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s a big difference between a rice cake and a bagel in terms of how many calories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, (inaudible at 00:19:35) have a lot of rice cakes which will\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean obviously, pay attention to what the serving size is. You know, I think if you were thinking about doing meal replacements, I think that\u2019s a conversation you really need to have with a nutritionist or a dietician. Somebody who really specializes in that. I\u2019d be hesitant to encourage <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">you to replace a meal with something that\u2019s not real food, but sometimes that is a suggestion that people make but I think you really need to sit and talk with somebody who is more of an expert and would be able to do some of the calculations with you about weight and height and body composition factors. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">I think a lot needs to go into big decisions like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I wouldn\u2019t do it for any other meal but breakfast because I like having real food too much and their diet I think is a little bit way \u2013like the one that they have written on their container is way too rigid and involves\u2014I added it up and it\u2019s about 1,200 calories a day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: That seems really low to me. It\u2019s something you\u2019d want to not drop down to without a doctor\u2019s recommendation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which is why I wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean, I guess replacing the not having breakfast at all. Because I was having breakfast most of the time but that was because I had to have breakfast to go to work and now that I\u2019m not going to work\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. If you\u2019re up in the morning eating is important. If you\u2019re sleeping through the morning, well then, you know, your first meal of the day. Call it whatever you want to call it. I\u2019m certainly happy to discuss food options with you because that is something I have a background in but we <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">start talking about meal replacements and things like that, it gets a little bit further out of what I\u2019m comfortable with (pause). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay. Also, even joining music again, I think, adds to the walking that I\u2019ve been doing because I have to, you know, wherever I park the car it\u2019s still at least a five minute walk to rehearsal and back another five minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So those little bits during the day add up to just having a more active day. That all counts in terms of moving your body and using the fuel that you put into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: I just wasn\u2019t getting out of the house besides work that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, which doesn\u2019t feel good in lots of ways. The commute was stressful, and you certainly started to feel isolated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: And I e-mailed a couple of friends and we\u2019ll have to figure out, because the day we originally chose didn\u2019t work but I might be getting together with one of my friends and knitting sometime this week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Good for you. You\u2019re really reaching out. How are things feeling with Sydney?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: Things are okay. The problem with \u2013because I was having all the emotional problems that I was having, it wore (ph) away at him and he\u2019s still in recovery for that. I think things are getting a little bit better and getting better at not fighting with him and trying to not get annoyed when he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F51\">holds up our plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: So he feels like it was your distress that was setting off his panic?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: At least somewhat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: It makes sense that you guys would affect one another. Certainly you do feel affected by his emotions and he might feel affected by yours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: Well the panic today he didn\u2019t actually take his meds (ph) this morning and didn\u2019t realize until we were out at the restaurant, so he was going to take his meds when he got back. Unfortunately, he tried calling again over the weekend his psychiatrist and his psychiatrist still hasn\u2019t gotten <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">back to him yet. So that\u2019s been rather frustrating. But because he\u2019s so depressed I don\u2019t know that he would see a new psychiatrist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether or not his psychiatrist is a good doctor but I think the fact that he is impossible to get a hold of is really really not good. Sydney has missed a bunch of appointments though, but then rescheduling them is really hard. I don\u2019t know if his psychiatrist is possibly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">not getting back to him because he\u2019s skipped meetings at the last minute. Like he cancels day of when he\u2019s in the middle of a panic. You (ph) think so, because I guess they usually schedule them for early afternoon which is a hard time for him and he\u2019s much better off in (ph) morning and can get to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF2\">morning appointments. But yeah, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with the psychiatrist. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Does he see the same person for meds and therapy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Nope. His therapist is actually right over on the street. His psychiatrist is (inaudible at 00:25:35) which is also harder to get to. I mean, at least now I don\u2019t have my job anymore so he can have the car. His problem was also he didn\u2019t have the car so he had to take the T to get there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">Well, there was at least one time that he skipped an appointment when I was actually home from work and was willing to drive him over. So it\u2019s not just the commute, but that\u2019s a factor. But I think he really needs to be on anti-anxiety meds because he\u2019s not on anti-anxiety meds because he has the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">Serotonin syndrome thing that I do. So he can\u2019t take SSRIs so he\u2019s on lomutrin (ph), which is not good for anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting you guys have had some of the same reactions and some of the same med switches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">CLIENT: It took a lot longer for him. Like he had been on SSRIs for at least like a year before the Serotonin syndrome thing popped up. But like ever since the first time that he reacted badly\u2014each time they tried a different drug he reacted badly more quickly again, so yeah. (Pause) I don\u2019t know. (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">at 00:27:00) And I\u2019m trying to get him to come with me to Contra dancing. I\u2019m going to not ask him about tonight anymore because of his panic, but see if I can get him to go either to Swing on Wednesday or the Contra on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Is that something he\u2019s done with you in the past?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: Nope. I mean, I hadn\u2019t gone dancing in the entire time that we were dating until this past week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Oh wow. I didn\u2019t realize it had been that long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the last Contra dance I had been to would have been New Year\u2019s Eve of 2011 going into 2012.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a long time ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: And then I started dating him in like January 2012.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Well, I think it\u2019s important for you to go. It\u2019s definitely something you enjoyed. And if he\u2019s willing to go with you and you have something you can enjoy together that\u2019s great. But not making it dependent on him, because it sounds like you enjoy getting back in touch with this. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m not making it dependent on him, but I do think he needs to also get exercise because I am fine with him and his body and the way he looks but him being out of shape and always needing to lie down after being up for a short period of time is really frustrating to deal with and probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">not good for him. So I asked him if there was some form of exercise that he\u2019d prefer but he didn\u2019t have any ideas for that. He said he wanted to come to Contra with me. I mean that was before he had his panic attack today. I\u2019m going to assume today is out, but hopefully I\u2019ll get him to go with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: I hope he will. If you could both enjoy that would be great. Then you could reinforce each other and go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: And he might be joining music though he\u2019s going to take another week to think about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Do you want to do everything together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">CLIENT: No. Well they only have four guys as compared to eight girls. So it\u2019s really really off balance right now. And they have me singing tenor for pretty much everything, which is fine but just shows how desperately they need men. I guess Contra dancing isn\u2019t as big of a deal. It\u2019d be nice to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201211\">him come Swing dancing with me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Because then you\u2019d have a built-in partner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: And then I wouldn\u2019t have to ask people to dance and it wouldn\u2019t be awkward anymore, but Contra I don\u2019t mind going by myself. I mean I can do Swing by myself. It would just be preferable to have a dance partner with me. I guess the thing about going to Contra by myself is navigating my way to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201251\">Concord when it\u2019s really dark out. Was not the best experience in the world. I ended up going a slightly different way than what they had the directions they had given me, but it ended up going to the same place so I didn\u2019t actually get lost. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you did it.

I\u2019m not a fan of the drive, but I can do it. (Pause) Yeah. I can get out of the house by myself and do things by myself. Maybe it would be better if he didn\u2019t join Tequia. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s important for you to think about that too. Your (ph) decision doesn\u2019t need to be completely up to him. This is something that you have done. This is sort of your territory. In deciding whether or not you want to share all of the activities or if you want something to yourself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">Figure out what feels best for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:31:13) something to myself I could always see if I could get a knitting circle together, because that is not an interest that he shares. Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: Something to just let yourself think about. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: How can I make myself be more willing to cook and do dishes? Or is there no way to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: Well, what would feel like a reward for doing that? The easiest way to motivate yourself to do something is to give yourself a reward for doing it. Is there something you could work toward? What would make it worth it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: The problem is I can\u2019t really just buy any sort of financial reward because I\u2019m not earning any income so I\u2019m trying to only buy things that I need for the most part. And for rewarding myself with like time knitting. I guess I could hold off and like I can\u2019t knit until I wash these dishes. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">guess usually the reward is washing the dishes so that I can be able to have dinner at home, which doesn\u2019t really feel like much of a reward but it does get me to do the dishes. (Pause) I need to go to the grocery store and have just like (inaudible at 00:33:06) do all the things and I don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201392\">want to do all the things so I\u2019m putting the rest (ph) of them off until tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20138-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20138-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: What is it that you really have to do? Instead of thinking about it as all the things, what is it that you really need to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: I need to go grocery shopping, I need to do the dishes, which I realized with my cups, the glasses are kind of long so I need to buy a bottle (ph) brush, so that also means going to the store to get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: [You usually] (ph) can get that in the grocery store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: I mean, I was planning on also going to the hardware store because I also have to get a screw to put something in, so that there\u2019s that errand too. And then there\u2019s laundry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: If they\u2019re all things that feel unappealing to you, you can spread them out. Pick one unappealing thing to tackle per day. You know, that\u2019s one way of maybe getting yourself on a routine of crossing off one chore type of thing a day. Or if it feels like there\u2019s a way to combine them to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201431\">it easier for yourself, thinking about stores that are close together, getting as much done in one place as you can. This screw is going to be a little bit hard to come by not at a separate store. (Chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t get that at the grocery store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: No, I don\u2019t think so. (Chuckles) But you might be able to find a place close by or something like that makes a little bit easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: You know, I\u2019m really not that far from the grocery store or hardware store. It\u2019s just finding the time to do that and originally we were going to at least do the hardware store after we both had our therapy, but now Sydney is probably doing a phone session because of his panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: So your whole plan changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: I mean I guess there\u2019s no reason why I couldn\u2019t stop on the way home and get the screw and the bottle brush by myself. I don\u2019t think we (ph) would also do the grocery shopping today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Well, what about just walking to one of the hardware stores in the square and picking it up before you go home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure if I have enough parking for that. I might, but I don\u2019t want to risk it. I don\u2019t know, I guess I probably do. I guess I can do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Did you park in a two hour spot or an hour?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: I got myself an hour and a half parking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: Because there\u2019s a\u2014right kitty-corner. So that doesn\u2019t require a lot more effort. You\u2019re already out here. It definitely would have a screw. I don\u2019t know about the bottle brush, but that might be one way of checking off a few things with pretty minimal extra effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: I can probably do that. (Pause) That would just leave the dishes and laundry and grocery shopping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Maybe knowing that you\u2019ve tackled something today maybe start off the day when you have maybe more energy and get something checked off right away the next day. (Pause) What is your sleeping schedule been like since you stopped working? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2015A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">CLIENT: So I try to go to bed, problem (ph) was Sydney wanting to stay up and also me getting back from dance so late. You know, Contra is like 7:30 to 10:30 and then a half hour drive back. Swing dance is 9:00 to 11:30. I ended up leaving at 11:15 last time. So getting back late and then Sydney wanting <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D1\">to watch the television and me being like, \u201cOkay. I haven\u2019t gotten to do anything on the Internet and stuff. So like, going to bed at 2:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot of time between getting home at maybe 11:30 and 2:00?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">THERAPIST: Where does all that time slip away to? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">CLIENT: (Pause) I guess waiting for Sydney to finish up whatever video game he\u2019s playing before we watch the show we want to watch. (chuckles) Like Friday night, we were up pretty late but then Sydney couldn\u2019t get back to sleep. We were up until 3:00. And then Sydney woke me up\u2014well, first he work me <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201651\">up at 6:00 and then he woke me up again at 8:00 and we ended up getting an early breakfast and resetting our sleep schedule. Saturday night we went to bed at like 10:30 and last night we went to bed at like 12:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s kind of all over the place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m trying to make it more regular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">THERAPIST: I think maybe you might find that if you are able to have a more regular bedtime, you know, skewing (ph) to the earlier end of the times that you mentioned. You know, getting to bed by 11:00 or even midnight is going to make a big difference between going to bed at 2:00 or 3:00, because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">think when you sleep really late in the morning, kind of sleeping through the whole morning and waking up around noon, it gives you much less time in the day to accomplish some these things on your list. Because even though you might stay up for the same amount of hours, you\u2019re not going shopping at <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B2\">10:00 at night. You\u2019re not going to go do laundry at 10:00 at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">So it shortens the number of hours that you have to do some of these chore type things or errands that you find it hard to approach and if you\u2019re starting your day really late, and then by the time you get breakfast and do something to relax or get ready and get out of the house, a lot of that time <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D1\">is kind of gone for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">So it might be easier to kind of set yourself on a schedule and getting up in the morning time and then using that morning time to tick off one these kinds of chores when stores are open. And if you find that getting to the store\u2019s a really big deterrent, then figuring out what things you can do online <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F1\">and removing one barrier. If getting to a place is the big barrier, then figuring out whether it\u2019s worth it to order groceries or look around the house for the things that you need to pick up and see what you can order from Amazon. You know, those conveniences exist now for almost everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. Just figure getting groceries online would be really expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: Look and see what the cost difference is. If that would make a noticeable difference to making it easier for you to make food at home and make a healthier choice\u2026 Do a true cost comparison rather than assuming what it\u2019s going to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20172-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20172-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561899\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20175\">CLIENT: Okay.

What would you like it to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">CLIENT: (Pause) I guess the continuing to get out more thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Allow yourself to focus on one piece at a time. Getting out more really seems to have made a difference in how you feel. Let\u2019s see if you can repeat some of the things you did last week this week and start to solidify that as a behavior change, making that choice to get out. And these <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B1\">other ideas, we\u2019ll kind of keep them on file to be implemented when the time feels right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Anything else we should have caught up on today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20181\">CLIENT: No, but we should do scheduling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20183\">THERAPIST: Okay.

I\u2019m not sure. Or if I should just cancel it for\u2026 the 10th I\u2019ll be around. The 17th I\u2019ll be around, but the 24th I\u2019m going to be house-sitting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">THERAPIST: Are you gone that whole week or just that day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">CLIENT: I\u2019m gone that whole week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Okay.

I\u2019ll put you in for the 31st for now, and if you find out that you\u2019re not going to be back by then we will pick another date that week so not missing two weeks in a row.
