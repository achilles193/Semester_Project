(inaudible at 00:03:59) I forget about it sometimes because it doesn't seem that important all the time. Or it's not or I just don't really want to talk about it. And I tend to have the idea that \"Well if <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">it's not a crisis then it's not that important to talk about.\" I also tend to have the idea that I know what is a crisis and what isn't.

I was really when I talked to Dr. Vaughn she said that there had been some miscommunication between her and (inaudible at 00:04:50).

Probably. I mean that's certainly a familiar pattern to me. It feels like I just shouldn't bother or it feels like I don't really want to talk about it when it's actually going on inside. I'm just reluctant to tell you some things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

It's there. But it's not that big of a deal.

(sighs) (inaudible at 00:09:44) (pause until 00:10:04) I think part of the stress of yesterday was that I came home and I just could barely stand up. I was so tired. James had made dinner. And he did laundry. Basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">he just really took care of me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: And then Amanda and Jason sent me a care package, which is really lovely. They made cookies and muffin cups. So they're like giant chocolate chip cookies and scones. And a kind of pumpkin loaf thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: So it was clearly something that they had gotten for me. And burned me a (inaudible at 00:10:55) CD and stuff like that. And also just like picked up stuff from the living room and put it in the box. So there is like a little electric car that stopped working like 5 years ago that we used to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">play with. There's a whistle. I don't know why. And it was just a really nice thing. Amanda sent me a dress it was clear that she bought the dress for her and it didn't fit her so she was sending it to me. (laughter) It didn't fit me either but I can alter it I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: It was just a really nice thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: But I just felt bad about myself. Trying to do the thing where I interrogate why I feel these ways. And I don't like having to be taken care of like this. And I don't like I don't know. Maybe it's that I feel really helpless. I think. If James hadn't made me dinner I don't know what I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200811\">have eaten for dinner. (pause at 00:12:29 until 00:12:40) And I don't like being the center attention. I don't like it being about me more than (inaudible at 00:12:52) especially. Actually no. I don't like it being about me when it's like I've done something good either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:13:04) I don't. Because at the same time I really want it to be about me in some ways. One of the reasons that I want to go to couples counseling is because I feel like I can't talk about anything but myself and I want to be taking care of James.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098804\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: And (pause at 00:13:27 until 00:13:35).

Or sees you as being? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Mm. Probably to an immense extent. But yeah.

I think I was trained pretty effectively that it wasn't okay for me to need to be taken care of. For me to need somebody to make dinner for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:16:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: And partly though it was because I didn't really like things that were for dinner partly. Because it wouldn't always be dinner when I was hungry. So if I was hungry I had to make the food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yep.

(pause at 00:16:48 until 00:17:04) (sighs) In some ways when I was a kid that relationship really worked because she would give me everything. And then what she wanted was for me to listen to her about everything. And be the audience. It feels like. I don't know how much of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">is me just being older and bitter but I remember her talking a lot about the guys that she was dating or her (inaudible at 00:17:43) at work.

(pause at 00:19:04 until 00:19:17) But so I wouldn't you know when I was real young I think I wouldn't ask for other things I wanted. If I was hungry I would just fix some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">food. (pause at 00:19:37 until 00:20:09) I don't know (inaudible). Probably a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

You can do that for people! They don't have to walk all the way to the bathroom all the time.\" (chuckles) Of course I still did walk all the way to the bathroom.

And I worry about that.

You start to step back from them. You start to feel like you're not being fair. In other words you're kind of like the version of the story that you have today. But I think as that starts to feel more about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">you, you tend to feel anxious, guilty, worried you're taking up too much space in some way. I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yes. I immediately move to trying to reconstruct how things would've been for my parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Because my point is this is how that's happening in here as you're telling the story.

There was one time it was New Year's Eve. The year after my parents split up. It was the first apartment she lived in after they split up. And I think she was there for like two years. So I was seven or eight. And I really wanted to stay up until midnight because that's what you do when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">you're seven. You want to stay up until midnight because midnight is so far away! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: And we were watching like X-Files or something and I fell asleep. And when I woke up I woke up in the middle of the night. It was like after midnight and everybody else had gone to bed. And I was just like soooo upset. I was crying. And I called for mom. And I don't know what was going on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">with her. I imagine she must have been crying too but she yelled at me. And that's the only time she's ever yelled at me that I remember. And she just said, \"Stop it! Go to sleep!\" And she didn't come in my room. (pause at 00:24:43 until 00:24:51) It's like the only time I remember asking her for something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: That wasn't pretty specific and easy to do.

I was so hurt. I don't know why. I was just crushed. I was just so upset that they hadn't woken me up before the ball dropped. (pause at 00:25:53 until 00:26:24) Did I tell you about -.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:26:26) It's (inaudible) I think is true. What keeps going through my head is that she dropped the ball.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: (chuckles) (inaudible at 00:26:40) (laughing) Yeah. Yeah. Did I tell you about going to Newfoundland the year after my parents separated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: You told me about (inaudible at 00:27:04) Newfoundland . I don't remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098804\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Well this was the year after they separated. We went with a big group of youth group people. I think some youth group kids and some just adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: So this big group of people. And the island that we usually camped on nobody was there. And I think the reason I remember the story is it's a story that my dad used to tell a lot about me. And I hated that he told it. I hated it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: One more thing (inaudible at 00:27:37) drop the ball.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. (inaudible at 00:27:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: So I was going to say the reason I mention this is not so much to be funny. Although it was sort of funny. But because it seems plausible to me that sometimes things can work linguistically that way. Like with (inaudible at 00:28:09) or puns or with plays on words in dreams. Or fantasies <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">where sometimes the symbolism or the reason something takes on the significance that it does is because of the play on words in the way the language works. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Well that makes sense to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: (laughs) (inaudible at 00:28:31)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: And so (inaudible at 00:28:36). I wonder if that was part of it. If you're old enough to know what dropping the ball meant and if that related it's not to hard to imagine in it's own right (inaudible at 00:28:53 excited about what you wanted to do. You needed their help but you feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F31\">it was too much to ask . But I guess I wonder if there is also this linguistic connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Mm. I don't think there was one then. There might have been one later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: It's not something I've thought about before. (inaudible at 00:29:13)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Of course I'm wondering if this relates to a kind of linguistic thing that even at seven was probably a phrase that you knew. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: I don't know. It doesn't feel like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: But realizing she's not coming was the big thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: Like I thought she was going to come and then she didn't come. (inaudible at 00:29:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: Both in terms of keeping you up and (inaudible at 00:29:49).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at 00:29:50 until 00:30:01) Yeah I thought I could ask for that and I couldn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: Anyway so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Sorry yeah there was a story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: So I'm going to Newfoundland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:15) your dad tells the story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's a story that my dad tells.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: And he tells it differently than I remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: And the way he tells it is we're going to Newfoundland. The port or the bay that we put in at is about a couple hour boat ride from the place where we camp usually. Or used to camp every year. And every year we camped there. So it's a long trip. And when we got out there we found out that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D1\">we found that other people were staying on the island that we usually camped at. And that was first time that had ever happened. And so it was like a disaster. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">So we went to like a nearby island that was screened so we couldn't see them. And I think they sent somebody over to talk to them and figure out how long they were going to stay. And it turned out those people were going to leave the next day. And so we had a meeting with everybody and said, \"Well do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F1\">we want to wait here and stay here or go off exploring?\" And my dad kind of said he really had always sort of been thinking about going to the further outreaches. More remote places in the bay that he hadn't really spent much time in. (inaudible at 00:31:34) fishing was good. Basically have an adventure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F2\">So that was what he felt he wanted to do. (inaudible at 00:31:42) wanted to do it too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098804\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">And the way he said it is that I stood up and I said, \"You know there have been a lot of things that have changed in my life this year. I really would like something to stay the same.\" And he said nobody was going to argue after that. Like (inaudible at 00:31:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">And I hate it when he tells this story because what I remember is me I don't remember it that differently. But my emotions are totally different. I'm sure I did not say it as like eloquently as my dad tells it. And what it felt like was I used the fact that my parents were getting divorced to manipulate <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201231\">everybody into doing something that I wanted and they didn't want. And so we did stay. And I just felt really, really guilty about it. And then (inaudible at 00:32:48) kept telling the story about and he was really like-. I think this is a story he tells because he's proud of me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: He's like trying to brag on how I can stand up for myself. And ask for what I need. Or that I'm articulate. Or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:33:16) reflective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: Maybe. Yeah. (inaudible at 00:33:25) feel so guilty. I got what I wanted because I was in pain. That's not a good reason. You know if my parents hadn't been getting divorced it wouldn't have mattered what I wanted. You know? (inaudible at 00:33:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. You mean in that sense you felt like you knew you had to play that card to (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Basically. Or even if I didn't know that I had to play that card I was playing that card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I want to make sure that I'm clear that you're not upset exactly about his reasons for telling it. You're upset because sort of the theme you find in it is very different. And hurtful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (pause at 00:34:47 until 00:34:56) Most of the stories he tells about me I don't like that much. Stories they tell to talk about how I'm really smart or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well the first place they're stories about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: (chuckles) That's true. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: I think what's all over everything (inaudible at 00:35:21).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:28) taking care of you last night. Not wanting to tell me about being suicidal I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: To the stuff you're describing (inaudible at 00:35:43) here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know when James and I got married the toast that he made was and the toasts were kind of rough for me in general. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: But the one he made he read out loud a story that I'd written when I was in fifth grade. And it was just excruciating. I almost started crying. Like legitimately crying not happy crying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like this is suffering crying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It had been like this great day. And it was really joyful. And it was so lovely but I guess I just really don't like hearing my writing out loud. Unless I think it's really very good. And it doesn't matter that I wrote when I was in fifth grade. It's still not my best writing and so I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B1\">don't want it attached to me. (chuckles) Yeah. This was a story that I really liked while I was writing it but it was basically eighty percent ripped off of a novel that I really liked at the time. And so that was fine. It's how kids write. But you know I kind of talked to Amanda about it later. (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B2\">at 00:37:13) \"I think he was just really proud of you.
