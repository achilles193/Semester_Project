Yes, that does make sense. I guess I'm wondering about an additional element that feels like it's sort of those things which are true, they don't sort of point to how things feel for you between you and I. In other words, like (unclear) to each other and I feel like a good actor or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201A51\">a bad actor, not in the sense of like, performance but in the sense of like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know \"actor.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">(Pause): [00:43:50 00:44:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD\">CLIENT: (inaudible) like that principally, all these things are part of that feeling of waiting for the shoe to drop and (unclear) but part of it, I guess, has to do like should actually be reassuring things about it and you're feeling anxious waiting for it. Some of the reassurance is about, 'okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD1\">now we're back in this process that's familiar and that I know.' And you say you know it as a version of like the cultural (unclear) of psychotherapy and a version of what actually happens in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B1\">THERAPIST: And the other piece that I was wondering about is a version of the same thing where you're having trouble and somebody says something that hurts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B3\">(Pause): [00:45:03 00:45:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B5\">CLIENT: I don't, I'm sorry. I don't quite know what you mean by the last one. Like are you saying like it's in tight and I'm not really sure -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Or that you come to someone having a hard time and you're feeling down or so critical or suicidal or whatever it is and maybe they say, 'wait until the (unclear) change,' or maybe they explain logically why it doesn't make sense for you to feel bad. Maybe they say, 'you know, what was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201B71\">that?
