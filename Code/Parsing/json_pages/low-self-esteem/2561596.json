(pause) Like helping my friends who that you know in the hopes that we will be a friend. Thinking I guess another way of other people do maybe is just like, is just be themselves. I don\u2019t know like. I\u2019m just wondering if why do people want to hang out <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">with certain people. Like my other friends with certain people, and it\u2019s seems like maybe it\u2019s you know. The trick is just be yourself and be like a strong person and people are attracted to that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(Sneezes loudly)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I guess I can, I have been that way before, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like be nice and be confident and people are going to get to know me and want to be my friend. But I guess I\u2019m insecure if they don\u2019t, and they don\u2019t just want to be my friend I have to do something extra to be, to make them like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">me or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I guess when I\u2019m feeling insecure is when I feel I think this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: It seems like a piece of you has been decreed as a certain kind of indebtedness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And that indebtedness feels like that, because it kind of formed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Then I\u2019m feeling like it\u2019s gonna go sour so quickly, and in so many ways like people hate that feeling of indebtedness. I guess I would too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s like getting to be a little too much, because I have seen [inaudible] like even today I was just like. I threw my phone when I saw him calling me, like oh my god, you know. Like I was like we\u2019ll meet at 12 and get it done, and he\u2019s like no let\u2019s meet at 3.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Right because one thing that it can create is that kind of resentment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. Not having boundaries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: And another problem is that people who are willing to take a lot may not feel indebted and they feel entitled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not true always, but he does seem like he\u2019s taking a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. No I don\u2019t think he feels entitled. He might feel like hopeless. So. I mean it almost sounds good to be like okay you know what [inaudible] but then he\u2019s like there\u2019s a snow storm coming, and we\u2019ll probably won\u2019t be able next couple days. I\u2019m like fine. And my work is suffering for sure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">I haven\u2019t been able to do much myself, and I had grand plans of doing some [inaudible] but I think about it too much, and I just keep telling myself, I\u2019ll catch up, I\u2019ll catch up, I\u2019ll catch up. So none of this stuff is done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">(1 min 30 sec. pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah I just want to [inaudible] and forget about it, you know like I won\u2019t see him for a bit. I don\u2019t know what that means but I want him to think I\u2019m dead and really so tired now. I will feel for him and scared for him and all that. I\u2019m hopeful for him, and want the best for him so now I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">just like please let\u2019s just get this done so I just have to see him this once a bit. And I can see him socially, and you know I\u2019m at that point. Does that mean I don\u2019t want him to feel indebted? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know I think I\u2019m (pause) Yeah even with like my Mom [inaudible] and she was like thanking me yesterday, and telling people. Yeah she did a lot, and I was just like, no you did most of the work I just kind of sat with you for a few days and put it all together. And that\u2019s I\u2019m not to [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">I\u2019m just trying to like see it the way that it is. You know she put in months and months of effort. So did all the leg work for the research and all, so. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561596\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: So I also go in to see him for a bit either, you know it\u2019s just late. Just want to retreat within myself and focus on my own self. Like time when there\u2019s no need [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s your there\u2019s actually your [inaudible] now? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah it\u2019s like below 50.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Does it not work or did they not turn it on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I have no idea like last night it was below 50 and this morning I was like fine I will go to a caf\u00e9. Gonna have to figure out where I will be during the next couple of days if there\u2019s gonna be no heat obviously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah I mean like I think [inaudible] or I thought about this from my own but I just see that image that you would like of people who have friends who are you know just friends. For the sake of being friends and the reason why these people attract other people as friends is because they have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">confidence and they are strong, and they are function so. You know? That\u2019s why people have. I mean to get at that place, and not to like recruit friends from a place of insecurity, and I mean I\u2019m like, okay I just have to bend over backwards and maybe someone will come by and be my friend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: It shouldn\u2019t from a place to a bad place, or start helping people because I feel if I don\u2019t then they won\u2019t be my friend, you know. (pause) some like anxiety of his. So [inaudible] is also around the holidays it\u2019s just like it gets so much, so confusing. I wanted my mom to invite him for tea, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">and before that I was like you have to clean up your place really well before we can do that. When there\u2019s so much like old furniture there, and just like a mess, but I don\u2019t think we can hire new furniture just for the sake of the tea. But she did invite a few of my friends last night and Chris so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">I was like if you hadn\u2019t invited him I could have invited [inaudible], but so I went to sleep struggling with that. It\u2019s weird. So I was mad that I don\u2019t have any time to spend with one, so I was thinking about that, and like what can I do? You know I have my own work and then Clive comes over, my friend, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200513\">comes over. What do I do? So last night I didn\u2019t [inaudible] and went to sleep like. And then I\u2019m like you know when he\u2019s in Ohio and has a job, he does not even call. You know I\u2019m like he does not call for the whole week and then on Thursday or Friday when he is coming back he\u2019s like I\u2019m gonna be back, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200514\">let\u2019s hang out. I feel weird about that, I\u2019m like why can\u2019t I do the same to you, you know? If I do the same to you you are like you\u2019re ignoring me. Then he\u2019s like I guess I\u2019m more needy than you. When he\u2019s not here I miss him, but you know I\u2019m able to do more work. I\u2019m sad but. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: At least more productive. [inaudible] can be productive while he\u2019s here, it\u2019s not the case with. I just wondering what I\u2019m doing? Am I making like the worst mistake of my life you know. Giving up on [inaudible] like that whole life we built together and all those years that we invested in each <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">other and how we know each other so well. And we have similar likes and dislikes. And yeah we want pretty much the same things, I don\u2019t know about that. I feel like I do, but then you know the whole embarrassment, like social embarrassment especially like telling his parents that it didn\u2019t work out, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">and disappointing them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561596\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: So I just feel like so confused and why can\u2019t I make it work with him? Should I try again? Should I break up with [inaudible] and back to him. This is very, it\u2019s very confusing. Then I\u2019m like maybe this confusion will just [inaudible] itself out. So maybe I feel that I can do it now. (1 min 30 sec. pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: I feel like I don\u2019t need any more to worry about with these two people, these guys, and I just want to be with myself. And be as self-sufficient as I can. But then I think in terms of obligation a lot. You know like yesterday I felt the whole time I was at my Mom\u2019s place hanging out with my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">friends and Chris I was thinking [inaudible] would make being a student but he didn\u2019t respond back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I felt guilty for not hanging out with him, and today like I mean I said yeah tomorrow I will spend with you, but then I realized that I even today I don\u2019t know if that will happen because I have to help my friend again. So I just feel kind of, I feel in terms of obligation a lot. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">I\u2019m obligated to spend time with Nelson (sp), but I\u2019m obligated to worry about Chris and see him, you know? I mean I want too. There\u2019s a part of me that wants to see them, just because you know whatever I get from them, but then there\u2019s like this awful like heavy and a guilty feeling about, I mean I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">guess that makes me feel like [inaudible] lies to them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: And that kind of makes me panic and make mistakes, and fills me with [inaudible] and makes me feel, makes me judge them I think. Then I\u2019m like oh this guy is not right for me because he just does not get it that I need to work or that I have to help out my friend, and you know all that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: I guess I don\u2019t know exactly how to deal with that feeling of feeling obligated. Mostly if I feel obligated, and you make me feel obligated I will just do it, you know? And then I will carry resentment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I was gonna say but not necessarily happily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: No, not at all actually.  (20 sec. pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about these inserted versions or iterations of your relationship with your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: In so many different ways. I mean your mom can make hints to the extent to which she felt obligated. She sort of got through caught in the web of obligations. Being forced to marry your father, and then having you, and sort of the obligations and sort of the resentment. And the creation of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">indebtedness that she tried to create, she did create. Not intentionally but you know to you look what I sacrificed for you, and look what you owe me. And then the way in which it gets replayed in your life. It\u2019s kind of like a repetition, which certainly not all of your relationship with your mom, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">but it\u2019s an important feature of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561596\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: So you mean my other relations are like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Well there seem like features of that, and even in your relationship with Chris, you supporting him for a time then feeling like you want him to take care of you that he sort of owns you, and they are features of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t feel like that now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah it does not seem like that. [inaudible] that\u2019s for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: I mean I wanted to push him away if anything, but then for a little bit I was back with him, and kind of liking that he was supporting me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well these don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think this defines all of your relationships but I do think that it is a feature of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which is why it was nice to kind of go out with Nelson because there is no history there\u2019s no such like feature make obligations don\u2019t feature. Until now. So now I\u2019m like wait why is this nice, fun relationship getting entangled or becoming messy, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what to do except just like call him and tell him I cannot see him [inaudible].

Maybe this time I did a little bit, but I feel like the strategy should be looking at what I need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">get done and then listening if I have time to help her, or even asking her questions of ok what do you need help with? Can you ask someone else? Or you know like think of more resources than just myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: I mean I do what she wants. I\u2019m the one that takes care of like being burdened by that matter overall. Just being conscious of it will help me so. I try. (pause) I guess every time I help someone, or decide to help someone I should really lay down the boundaries and just keep telling myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">you know watch out. Don\u2019t think that they are obligated to you now, you know? I guess stop myself before I feel, before I start to feel resentment.

I also think you want to help people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s only that, but<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: The extent to which you go and then you feel like you\u2019re sacrificing things that are important to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.  (pause) I mean I say no often enough. I mean I\u2019m not very charitable with my money just because I don\u2019t have much of it. But you know I don\u2019t<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Except with your mother historically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, well. There I\u2019m kind of doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s not true actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s easier just to write a check, that\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s different than saying there\u2019s nothing you could do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s a very important [inaudible]  (25 sec. pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: I mean I just I wonder if like feeling like I\u2019m sacrificing. Feeling like a martyr is like a way for me to like I don\u2019t know avoid some things. It\u2019s like a cop out maybe? I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561596\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: What comes to mind about what you\u2019ve been avoiding?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Like I don\u2019t know for not succeeding or something else like I cannot think of concrete examples. But like you know it\u2019s my writing or whatever, I feel like I used Chris and my mom as an excuse earlier. Just to say oh I can\u2019t really take a year off and write because I have obligations, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">have to sacrifice my own life for my mom you know. If I didn\u2019t do that I would just be like nope I don\u2019t have. I don\u2019t have to sacrifice, I don\u2019t have to or even just this matter I could have said. I\u2019m getting confused here, but I guess bad [inaudible] comes after the fact that I have sacrificed. Or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A92\">done something and then I\u2019m calling it sacrifice after its done, because then it\u2019s like, yeah I didn\u2019t succeed that year because I did that you know, because I sacrificed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: I could instead say no. Not just that we needed the money but I was too scared that year to take such a big leap to take such a big decision, and I wanted to make money. Instead of saying I sacrificed, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Taking more ownership for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah! (pause) So by putting the blame on others because (pause) I don\u2019t know like sitting alone at my desk writing is hard. Some days it\u2019s hard and other days it\u2019s not so hard. Some days are hard and I\u2019m like oh yeah might as well let my friend come over and help him. So that I shouldn\u2019t go <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">back and say I didn\u2019t write because of you today.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah I\u2019m working on getting friends just by being myself, or you know not offering any help in return. Because I see and people just don\u2019t do it you know like. I\u2019m trying to be helpful and offered help and then be like she is going to call me back. It\u2019s like okay.

I run away from obligations before anyone else does. So it makes me feel obligating and like no!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: You feel trapped by them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Because they don\u2019t feel voluntary. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve taken on these obligations voluntarily, and they feel imposed and trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Like how much of it is I think genuine affection and interest and love, and how much of it is you feel obligated, you know? I feel like that kind of leads to me to trouble a lot. Is that what you were saying that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">it is like at the core of a lot of my relations because of my relations with my mom and stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s at the core, because I think there are other things too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I mean the core of your relationship with Chris is not just that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: That is an important feature of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the core is like me leaning on him for structure, and stuff. Are we done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: No we still have 6, 7 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah I wonder like sometimes like seeing him I just feel obligated to feel love for him you know?

We all stayed until 1 just talking, and he was talking to people that I thought he would never really talk to. Because in my head, and again you would be like these <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">are your weird categories, but like in my head<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561596\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t say weird!

Or random.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Or self-imposed. I guess random isn\u2019t quite and arbitrary isn\u2019t quite right either because there\u2019s arbitrary mean that there\u2019s no sort of, it kind of has a random quality. But there is a reason you have those categories. And they are not arbitrary in your eyes. They\u2019re not arbitrary from <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">you vantage point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Its some objectives that are arbitrary I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: But not weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) Well you know like I would think he would never really. He is like [inaudible] he only talks to like, oh you know he said it himself several times, so there\u2019s reason for it that would make. If there\u2019s an interesting thought in your head I will like you or I will listen to you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">or something like that. So people yesterday, they are my friends. They are not really intellectuals. They are nice, kind, sweet people that I met in the community and they like me. Me. So Chris was talking to them for hours and listening and enjoying myself, and I was very surprised I was like ah! Why <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F12\">do people change or why are they complex? Because I thought he would never do something like this. Why is he doing this? (chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: And Nelson does like, that\u2019s what Nelson does. Like, so every night that I have helped my friend with an application or every evening we end up going over to Nelson\u2019s place and just hanging out with him. And he is very social, so just talks and like you know makes drinks for people so you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">I feel like that\u2019s what he does. So Chris doing something similar, in his own way of course, you know like confuses me a little bit. I mean he is still not very personable. He is reserved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: He has like his kind of his energy is very different from Nelson\u2019s. So it\u2019s like quieter and like more pointed. It\u2019s all used up in thinking through things instead of expressing emotion or. So. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: I mean there\u2019s a time I found that attractive of course. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t, but too much of it and only that over the years kind of made me feel like I was bored with it. Yeah I guess my categories are getting a little messed up. So that kind of scares me. Yeah it\u2019s unsettling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: How about reframing it as broader?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Broader?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Rather than messed up. Thinking broader.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: I see. More refined? Because now that I now Chris can be social like I can analyze how in different ways these 2 guys are social you know in different ways. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah I think the breakup is helping Chris also. He\u2019s like I have been so social this month than I have ever been in my life. I think that\u2019s a good thing. He\u2019s staying out late, and having a glass of wine and then waking up with a headache.
