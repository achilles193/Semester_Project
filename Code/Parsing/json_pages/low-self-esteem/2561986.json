data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: ...say that to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: You know, being late is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: among, you know, the top cardinal sins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yes, you know, my last name is Norwegian but I am sure my Norwegian heritage, if I have any, goes so far back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: (laughs) That\u2019s a good point. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: But I do have a time issue. So, you know, I mean African American and Norwegian somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: We must be on time. (sound of snapping fingers)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So maybe that is where I get it from. Well how are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I am good. I am good. Yeah, I had a few minutes to kind of re-collect, kind of refocus. It is like where am I at, kind of thing on the drive up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: But, yeah, I think what I feel like I took away from last week was, you know, that sense of The way I kind of reworded it or renamed it was \u201clooking at the fictions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay. Explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: You know? Looking at the fictions of my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: You know? It is like kind of one of a lesson or, you know, a kind of a place where I have been with my meditation practice recently is trying to see in all the different ways that what our minds tell us, moment to moment, is pretty much all fiction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Okay. Explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: That if you really sit and look at the thoughts and the stuff that is going on up here. You know, it is like just being able to kind of walk around the thought, analyze what is going on with the thought. It is like if you analyze that thought as being of the past -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: that in itself is a fiction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Because it is like, well, we have a memory of something -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: but you survey ten people in an automobile accident -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: you are going to have. Not saying that it didn\u2019t happen or was unreal but it was really a fiction. It is a fictionalized version of what happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: And if the memory happens or if what is going on in your mind happens to be (inaudible at 2:31) by the future, then that is pure fiction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: So unless you can just kind of remain in this place of being (laughs), you know, somehow completely in the moment, which I don\u2019t think I have ever actually been there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: I was going to say, \u201cLet me know.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You know, you practice meditation and I haven\u2019t got there yet. So. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: So I am like, you know, maybe that is a goal and maybe some people can get there. But for the most part we spend our day just sifting through this menagerie of fictions that we keep creating for ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">So for me that is kind of my filtering lens that I am kind of coming at when we were talking about that last week and it is like, \u201cAh!\u201d You know? It is like you just keep peeling away the layers of fiction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: And it is like, wow, look at this. Here is a really old fiction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: You know, that has been so prevalent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It is like a narrative and you look at narrative therapy terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It is the powerful narrative. I mean, of course, Gestalt says one thing about it. Existential says another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">THERAPIST: But I think in some ways, I mean, that is really insightful. And it is kind of all the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561986\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: But whether it is a fiction or whether it is a narrative it dominates. The dominant narrative is fiction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Right. But for me what is underlying all of that is that it is not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That is right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: You know, it is like we can call it whatever it is. But the bottom line is it is not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Okay. But you feel like it is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh, of course. And when we grab onto those kind of things and we make those our guiding paradigms of our life then that is where all the suffering is at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: So tell me, how did you then take that insight and emotionally interpret what it means for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was just like sitting with You know, and I think I probably spent the most time and probably spent immediate time kind of just sitting with the whole doctoral piece right now because there is some immediacy involved in that in terms of signing up, blah blah blah. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">it is like looking at where we were at talking about it. It is like, really, can you just look at what is being said without going through the filter of all of the past stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And what did you find?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: I found that I was able to hear it a little bit differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Tell me how you heard it then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Just trying to be with I am obviously not remembering exact wordings. But it is just like being with the experience of, yeah, somebody saw enough of something in you to ask you to consider that. And then when I opened myself up to that then I realize, oh, it wasn\u2019t just you there were two <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">or three other people on this trip that gave you that same message. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">And it is like, \u201cWow, wow!\u201d I had kind of discounted all of that stuff. And it wasn\u2019t until the message from Dr. Peterson actually kind of stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Then it was like disorienting. And then I kind of rewrote it to be something else. You sort of see -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: To fit your narrative of before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So how do you internalize that then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: I spend a lot of time kind of rethinking that and it is like, well, I need to back this up and I need to go talk this out again. So, you know, I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: How did you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: How do I feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Or how did I feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: How did you, how do you? If you embrace that as sort of the new truth, which would be a more balanced truth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: I think that I have internalized that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: How do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: (sigh) Well, I think that I was going to Well it is not a new experience so I think that the experiencing is energizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: You know? It is like, \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d That is what it is then let\u2019s go. So there is sort of this sense of like the old stories just get us stuck in the mud. And it is like, \u201cOh!\u201d That feeling of now because (laughs) we are in the midst of all of this snow but in the morning Never mind. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F1\">what it is like traipsing through the snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: And when you finally get out of the snow and you are on the sidewalk it is like, \u201cOh. oh. Okay. I can walk now.\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Is that what it is kind of like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It is kind of like that experience of, you know, you are trudging around or you are stuck in this not being able to move.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561986\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Not completely stuck but you are slowed down. And now it is like, \u201cOkay. I got this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So you mean sort of this kind of old fiction, as you describe it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: This kind of negative, self-esteem, not feeling good about yourself, not feeling like you belong. Those are the themes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And, you know, kind of coming out of that, looking around and beginning to actually accept, not only is that not necessarily the truth or the dominant narrative but it is part of the past. And it is true about how you felt but that is not the information you are getting from the majority <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B51\">of the environment these days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: You are getting affirming messages about your ability to be successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that Yeah. So it is energizing. I won\u2019t say that it is like It still feels a little tentative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: It is like I just sort of have to put a little trust in this. It is like, no, I am sticking with the trust part of this. It is like I am going to trust the fact that this is the messages that I am hearing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. So you still can\u2019t fully embrace it yet, you think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: Well, more than I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Okay. I will take that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: And it is kind of like, yeah, in that I feel like I am really trying to distinguish, am I putting this through the filter or are you just letting it stand. So it feels like I am in that place. You know? Hopefully, I am not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: What if that is the new normal? I mean what if that is the truth? That is the truth? What if it is? Then what does that mean for you or about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: Then, you know, I take that energy and I start moving forward with it. Into a certain degree I feel like, okay, that is what I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: How would that feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: How would that feel. Hm. Empowering. And there is a sense of self confidence. I have been struggling on a stupid little paper that I was trying to write. And that was a reflection paper on India for Peterson. And it is like I know that all of the garbage that I was dumping on top of this paper <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF1\">was not allowing me to get the paper done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Okay. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">CLIENT: I am not good enough to write this paper. What have I got to say that, you know. Like all of this kind of negative garbage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">THERAPIST: When does that pop up for you most? That script?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">CLIENT: Mm. (pause, sigh) Well, I am just thinking about that case and it is like, wow, that one popped up a lot but, you know, I put Peterson in this position of being somebody that I really respect. You know? And who is somebody who is really respected in his field. So it is like, you know, obviously <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D71\">people that I consider to be whatever, smarter than me, more accomplished than me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">So it is like, yeah. So I am playing this game of trying to impress somebody. Then it is like all of that other stuff comes up. You know, I think, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Okay. So because it is Nick Peterson and he has some pretty significant notoriety in the field, it was difficult for you to write the paper because you wanted to impress him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. And just in terms of that case it is like, mm, how far can I go back and is that the typical pattern?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561986\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: What I find interesting about that is that he was most impressed by you when you were just being you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, that is what I am saying. That it is like I am still You know, so I think that the more I am able to let that go I was able to get the paper done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yes. Okay. And so tell me about your process in terms of letting that go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: You know, there is almost a moment to moment kind of struggle sometimes. It is like, let it go. Let it go. You know, it is like you can feel that stuff coming up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: What is the stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know, the low self-esteem. \u201cI am not good enough.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d All the negative messaging. And it is just like, let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: But you fight through it every time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: But I fight through it every time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: You do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I am just trying to let that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Every time you want to do something or want to change careers or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: That is true, yeah. I do find a way to slog through it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: But you punish yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: You know, what are the, if you don\u2019t succeed in this program, which is highly doubtful, what are the stakes to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT: Well it would (sigh) Well, yeah. The first thought that comes to my mind is, \u201cWell, it is only ego.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT: I mean, what is the worst possible thing that can happen? I don\u2019t make it? Well I am assuming that I would have an LPC and I could, pffft, whatever. Or I can always go back to my woodshop and make bird houses, or You know, I mean I have got other options. If I don\u2019t make it in the program <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201011\">it is only a bruise to my ego.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: Sure. But it is a significant bruise. But the stakes financially, the stakes career path wise, the stakes are not huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: So who do you have to impress?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah, probably me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Tell me about impressing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, it is overcoming that garbage and recognizing that it is like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">THERAPIST: How would you impress you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">CLIENT: (pause) I am not sure because I think that what I recognize is going to happen, you know, the same pattern. It is like, you know. achieve this level wasn\u2019t good enough. Achieve that level, it is not good enough. So it is like I have got to break the pattern. That is not working. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: So I think that I recently read this little article, blog post, I don\u2019t know what it was. But it was something about, we don\u2019t really hate ourselves. And it is impossible for ourselves to really hate ourselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">CLIENT: And it was like, \u201cOh!\u201d It grabbed my attention so I sat with it for a couple of minutes and it was like The premise was that we are engaged in behaviors. When we hate something, when we truly hate something, we do something to try to get that out of our lives. So if there is some element about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201191\">ourselves that we hate or dislike we are trying to get rid of that part, you know, out of our lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">So we engage in behaviors that don\u2019t necessarily work. So instead of changing up the behavior we just do more of it. Thinking that if I do more of it (laughs) it will be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">THERAPIST: So what it is that you are doing more of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">CLIENT: (sigh) Trying to overcome that low self-esteem by, you know, upping the stakes all the time.

There is that sense of, you know, this isn\u2019t quite the right thing or the right job.

You know, and I think that that is kind of what I think the gift of this program is, is that it is like I see that, okay, the degree is great and I am sure the work is great and being able to help people is great. But it is like there is It is just this path of self-discovery <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201571\">right now or deeper self-discovery. It is not that I haven\u2019t done some of this work before. But it is like this is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">THERAPIST: That is not an answer, Seamus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">THERAPIST: That is an intellectualized answer about the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know.

It is like, oh, okay, this is transition time. This is like there is something else going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201671\">on here.

So what would that look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, it is like that challenge in those beginning classes of, you know, authenticity. Am I authentic?

I am just trying to remember. That we have maybe honesty at one level. You know? Kind of like our dealings with people. For me at the underneath level it is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B1\">like, \u201cAre you really honest?\u201d Can you really be honest with yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">Or, you know, is there just so much habitual energy around all of the stories that you have told yourself that you believe your own crap. You know, and it is like that is not honest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Well, is it honest? I mean, you know, you say you believe your own crap. But these are very painful stories -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A3\">THERAPIST: that somehow you picked up as a very young kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">THERAPIST: And a developing adolescent for all the reasons we have talked about. And so, as you see, you can\u2019t just let that go. Right? You can change the narrative and you can accept that that is not your truth, if it was at all. It is certainly not anymore.

And they just don\u2019t have time for bullshit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: They are kind of like, \u201cLook, I have parents, I have got kids, I have got all this stuff going on.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: \u201cI have got issues.

And one of the interesting things that happens is, so whether these are students who have seeing clients awhile or this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C31\">is the first client they will ever see, many of them go through this transformation where they think a professional counselor has to be formal and kind of buttoned up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">And I hear them on their tapes and I say, \u201cWho is that? I don\u2019t want that. Bring you back.\u201d Right? Because clients, we all do therapy in different ways, but clients come back to you because of who you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Some of what you do but they are attracted to the relationship you form with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">THERAPIST: And so when you look at The painful stories that you have lived you will use in your work. Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">THERAPIST: But, you know, also deeply, genuinely who you are. All of that. Your struggles, your joys, your fears goes into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">THERAPIST: So when you say you are not honest or, you know, kind of your struggling with this crap of sort of letting go of the script. You know, I guess I would hope that you would look at it a different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">CLIENT: Alright, well (pause) I think that what I am hearing you say in that or what I am sensing from you in that is that I am sort of wanting to like just drop, cut this off, deny it, it is not here. And for me, if that what I am projecting, that is not exactly where I am at with that. It is more <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201D71\">a sense of a feeling of, yeah, it is never going to go anywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">I mean that is the makeup, that is the fabric of who I am. And I get that. You know? But there is a difference between it being there I am just trying to think of an analogy or a metaphor that kind of sums up how I feel about that. There is a difference between (pause, sigh) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">You know, it is like I see these If I could have a relationship with that part of my life it would be more of one of like a book on a shelf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">CLIENT: It is like, okay. And it is there. It ain\u2019t going anywhere. You know? But this is a chapter and here is what I have learned from this part of my life. And here, if I can open this up for you, let me kind of explain. This kind of explains a little bit about who I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E1\">THERAPIST: So how would this explain it? What would you get from the book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E3\">CLIENT: From?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E5\">THERAPIST: That chapter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E7\">CLIENT: I am sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E9\">THERAPIST: The painful chapters. What would you get from it? What did you learn from it? Who did you become because of it? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561986\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">CLIENT: Mm. I see. I think that probably all of those experiences helped me to be really empathic. You know, I have had, you know, not all of the experiences in the world to have, but I have had some. You know? And it is like I know that feeling and I can feel that feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Which feeling? Which one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">CLIENT: Whatever. Low self-esteem, shame, feeling like you are the outsider, feeling whatever. You know? Not good enough, not smart enough. Whatever. You know, whatever those feelings are I am just saying that I think that all of those experiences, you know, really create the fabric of who I am. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF1\">it is not that I am really trying to cut that off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">But there is a difference between recognizing that and somehow being connected to that. You know? It is like then now you are kind of talking like being hardwired like a computer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST; Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">CLIENT: You know, and it is like it is not that experience. The experience is more of one of like here is a reference book that explains a little bit about who I am. As opposed to being hardwired to the story of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">CLIENT: So I am sorry. I am just I know that I think visually, whatever. And I am just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FB\">THERAPIST: I think it is pretty cool. You know. But whatever it is, whether it is a book or hardwired into a computer, right? It is sort of it is still here. It is still right in front of you. You still look at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">THERAPIST: I wonder if we can move it to the side or to the back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">CLIENT: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">THERAPIST: Right? So, you know, it is still here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">THERAPIST: It is still right in front of you because it is still the natural trigger. It is still your \u201cgo to.\u201d Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20209\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Where you take the compliment and your first reaction is, \u201cNo.\u201d And then you go, \u201cMaybe.\u201d And, I mean, that is still improvement because you go, \u201cWell, maybe.\u201d Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: But I wonder if, you know, you sort of embrace the fact that you are being validated for how bright you are, how capable you are. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">CLIENT: Mm hm.

There are times in your life I would imagine, if you went back, where there are chances to rewrite the script. But it has had a very powerful hold on you.

And so it has made you in some ways a deeply sensitive man. Uniquely qualified in some ways to be doing what you are studying to be doing. But not if you can\u2019t allow it to recede to the background. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20221\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20223\">THERAPIST: So as long as it is still in the forefront that is going to cause not only more pain, but it is going to be very hard for you when you are working with a client with similar issues to say all the right things and not feel them yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20225\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20227\">THERAPIST: But once you And it is in the process. I can see you working through it. But if you allow it to be there. I mean if you look at, you know, I don\u2019t profess to be an Adlerian therapist, okay? But if you look at Adler\u2019s inferiority complex, Right? And sort of taking that and to turning into <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202271\">very productive things. But eventually you have to let that quiet itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20226-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20226-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561986\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20229\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B\">THERAPIST: So eventually, when is And I guess when I say, what would it take to impress you? You know? In some ways, you should already be really impressed. You should be extremely impressed with who you are, what you stand for and how you proceed. Even if you are not always proud of the things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B1\">you have had to go through in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022F\">THERAPIST: You can still be proud of the man that you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20231\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that probably what I was kind of focusing in on when you said that. You know, I mean, maybe a couple of things, you know, initially. There is that one, that deeply German sense of we don\u2019t blow our own horns. We are not late. We don\u2019t blow our own horns. (laughs) So there is that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20233\">Then that I kind of picked up on that notion of, you know, the fiction of the self. And I am like, then I got kind of wrapped up into that whole But if I can put all of that aside and now just what you just said resonates. You know? So I recognize that it is like, well, that wasn\u2019t my first response <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202331\">but what you are saying does trigger something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20235\">THERAPIST: Which part resonates?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20237\">CLIENT: That, yeah, I am completely impressed with me. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20239\">THERAPIST: Oh, well good! (laughs) Wow! Say more about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023B\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I mean part of who I am and where I am kind of is based upon It is like, okay, I have got all of this other garbage over here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023F\">CLIENT: You know? But I do have plenty of success stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20241\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20243\">CLIENT: You know? That I can look at and it is like, \u201cCan I handle the doctoral program? Yeah, you can handle it.\u201d You know? Because I have got all of these other things that I have accomplished and it is like, hmph, it is just another thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20245\">THERAPIST: It is. But that is the part that is not internalized yet.

And it is not about blowing your own horn. I mean sometimes that is appropriate too. But it is really about letting that be the dominant message. Which doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get scared or feel insecure sometimes. But it does mean you spend more of your time feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202511\">good about yourself -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20253\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20255\">THERAPIST: and the things that you are capable of and what you have accomplished than not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20257\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, and I think that that is what allows me to slog through the snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20259\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025B\">CLIENT: In order to be able to keep going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Yes, I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20261\">THERAPIST: But I think that is what you don\u2019t recognize on a consistent level.

You always stand up and take care of your responsibilities and uphold your obligations and do it anyway regardless of if you feel depressed -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028D\">THERAPIST: or scared or insecure. So to me that is the dominant message. Right? And that can\u2019t come through because if this is the dominant core it is like, I guess I am not a visual person but to use a visual. It is like you let the bees come in or birds and peck the shit out of it, okay, until <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2028D1\">it is dominant but it is limping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20291\">THERAPIST: But that is your dominant message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20293\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20295\">THERAPIST: Your whole life that is more of a dominant message than the negative things that you got about yourself, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20297\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20299\">THERAPIST: I mean, how do you take in what I am saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029B\">CLIENT: No. I am on board with that. Yeah. I get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029D\">THERAPIST: So how do you let that be at the center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029F\">CLIENT: Hm. Well. (laughs) I think I am going to start practicing one of these silly things I saw on a Ted Talk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A1\">THERAPIST: Okay. Tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A3\">CLIENT: (laughs) And I don\u2019t know if I can pull up that Ted Talk and send you a copy of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, please do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A7\">CLIENT: But it was directed toward girls and it was that this woman was working with girls who are having self-esteem issues and confidence issues. And it was all in just changing their behavior, their external behavior. You know? And she got girls to take a look at the way they were standing, the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202A71\">they were sitting. And it is like, kind of her premise was that the way that we carry ourselves -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A9\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AB\">CLIENT: you know, has a direct impact on how we think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AF\">CLIENT: And vice versa. So she is like, she did this research study where she just had girls pose in powers of position. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B3\">CLIENT: Confidence. And it is like two minutes a day and it changed up their -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B5\">THERAPIST: How they felt about themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B7\">CLIENT: How they felt about themselves. And it is like, you know, it is like start acting like it. You know, it is just like, look, if this is your dominant feature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202BB\">CLIENT: And we just recently took the strengths finder assessment in the careers class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202BD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202BF\">CLIENT: So it is like having It is like, \u201cOh!

So it is empathy, connectedness. And you have to kind of look at their definitions of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CD\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CF\">CLIENT: Um. (pause) Shoot. (sigh) I am just able to hang on to empathy right now -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D3\">CLIENT: with the number one strength.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D5\">THERAPIST: Was that your number one strength.

It was like, yeah, I felt really comfortable with the assessment. It is like, yeah, that is who I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D9\">THERAPIST: Yes. So I guess my argument would be, you actually don\u2019t strike me as somebody who does not know himself well. You strike me as somebody who is sometimes uncomfortable with some aspects of you or some of the things that you have had to experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202DB\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202DD\">THERAPIST: But you actually don\u2019t strike me as somebody who is completely unaware of who he is, what he wants, what he stands for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202DF\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E1\">THERAPIST: Right? I mean I think is shame clouds the issue from earlier, from those experiences.

Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E5\">THERAPIST: I mean, am I making this up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E7\">CLIENT: No. I think that that is completely accurate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E9\">THERAPIST: So I think if you go back You know, you were the guy who the outside motivation to people please had you engaged to the young woman who was expecting when you were in college. But that is one motivation. Things are much more complicated than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202EB\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202ED\">THERAPIST: Some of that was deep empathy for her circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202EF\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F1\">THERAPIST: And the fact that she was by herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F5\">THERAPIST: And she was a close friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F9\">THERAPIST: Right? So some of it So it is easy to go, well, here you are trying to people please again. You got yourself in this situation. Well, you could buy her flowers and candy or help to pay her bills. Right? But some of it you were moved by your sense of compassion, caring and empathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202FB\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202FD\">THERAPIST: Right?

And your sort of anger at the situation and sort of being closed out, you know, is a struggle for you because you have empathy for her traumatic circumstances. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20303\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20305\">THERAPIST: It just, of course, craps all over you own very real needs. Right? So, you know, I think it is not that simple. Some of it, the outside motivation, the part of you that you might not like about you is the people pleaser part. But the part of you maybe that if you reframe it, the part of you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203051\">that wants to be connected to other people because that is not how you felt growing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20307\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20309\">THERAPIST: You know?

I mean you have to be able to deal with angry students. You have to be able to deal with clients who aren\u2019t necessarily happy with what you are doing to work on the relationship. Right?
