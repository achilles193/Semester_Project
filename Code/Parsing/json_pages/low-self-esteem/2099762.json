I don\u2019t really have anything to talk about this morning. I don\u2019t know. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if you are but I would kind of feel annoyed I\u2019m so late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: No. Okay. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: It gave me time to catch up on twitter out in the waiting room. Actually no, I was lying. I have a whole list of things to talk about. So this yarn store business. Did I tell you about it? So Caitlin pulled out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: It was you and Daria, and Caitlin and Lark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Caitlin pulled out because she got a job that she applied for months ago, a start-up publishing company. Their senior editor, and she just does not have time for anything else. I realized that, like I had a moment of panic when I had read her e-mail saying she was pulling out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So talked to her to impact that, this was yesterday morning. I thought about it all during my lunch break. I realized, as much as I love Daria, she\u2019s a wonderful woman and has many fine qualities. I don\u2019t trust her to be able to run a business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Like, I was really counting on Caitlin, because Caitlin is very together, very on top of things, has fantastic administrative skills. Daria, kind of a flake. I hate saying that, it sounds really harsh. Especially because I\u2019m kind of a flake too. I didn\u2019t see any way the two of us could make this work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">and not have it destroy our friendship. So I pulled out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">Daria hasn\u2019t responded to my e-mail saying that I was pulling out. Nor has she responded to an e-mail I sent to a mailing list that we\u2019re both on trying to organize that groups next social meet up. So I\u2019m getting awfully anxious and neurotic. Like, what if she\u2019s mad at me and not speaking to me because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I pulled out. And not, you know, it could just be that she\u2019s busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">Because she\u2019s writing a novel and has deadlines for her job that actually pays money. Is planning to take her kid to visit colleges this weekend. So she\u2019s probably very busy and just didn\u2019t have time. But I\u2019m still feeling terribly anxious and borderline neurotic about it. You know, \u201cWhy won\u2019t she answer <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">me?\u201d (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">But yeah, I finally made the decision. I talked it out with Dave and with a very close friend of mine who\u2019s known me from well, since we were 18, and they both confirmed that this was probably the right call. That, you know, there\u2019s\u2014by continuing to stubborn my way through would have just ended in disaster <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">for everyone. I still feel really guilty about leaving Daria to twist in the wind on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It was clearly the right decision. I feel it was the right decision. People whose advice I respect told me it was the right decision, but I still feel guilty and that\u2019s deeply upsetting to me. Like, is it normal to feel guilty over things that are the right thing to do? It is? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">Okay. It\u2019s not pleasant. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It is normal. It can also involve anxiety neuroses, all sorts of stuff. But many people, most people, I mean,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(Pause from  to ) I think you feel a bit like, I\u2019m letting you twist in the wind if I\u2019m not kind of more reassuring about\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Maybe a little bit. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099762\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: If I had to guess, if I\u2019m not reassuring, I imagine that it feels like, I\u2019m kind of being neglectful, or that I don\u2019t care that you are anxious. Sort of like, don\u2019t really matter to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I think that I recognize that you\u2019re not being reassuring because it\u2019s for my own good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019m sure at some point will you see it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think I ascribed motivations. (inaudible) just stubbornness maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: (Laughter) (Pause from  to ) Stubbornness in that? (Pause) I\u2019m like digging my heels in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: A little bit. Maybe. Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: About what? I know that sounds like a trivial question, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the sort of thing I would do. Right? Like if I said, you know, I\u2019m not going to do X, Y, Z. For me it would then become a matter of pride, you know? There\u2019s no amount of pleading or cajoling that you could do that would cause me to give in and actually do X, Y, Z when I said I wouldn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I see. So that\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m coming from. Damn it, I\u2019m not going to be reassuring. (Laughter) Just admit why you are saying wouldn\u2019t happen. No way. (Laughter) Forget it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: And I mean, I understand that\u2019s probably not what\u2019s actually going on. But you\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s kind of why I want to get this sorted out, you know. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. This week has been a, pretty terrible for you know, anxious neurotic, why aren\u2019t they talking with me moments. So Thomas, things went really well Saturday. I think I told you that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: And you (inaudible) on Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m very much looking forward to that. But, so, I might have mentioned LiveJournal, and Thomas and I had given each other permission on LiveJournal for years and years and years. From like 2001 until like, I stopped using LiveJournal in 2010. Moved everything over to DreamWeb. And did <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">not keep most of my old permissions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">But Thomas kept me as a friend on LiveJournal, so I still have permission to read his journal even though I didn\u2019t\u2014because I stopped using that service. But you know, when we had been e-mailing, before the date on Saturday, he had said, you know you still have permissions to read my LiveJournal if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">want to go and read them. So I did and was deeply entertained. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">But I figured reciprocity is only fair because I am perhaps overly concerned with reciprocity in relationships. And so I told him, just so you know, I stopped using LiveJournal, but I have been you know, posting shit to Dreamweb. Well, not shit, posting stuff to Dreamweb. You know, here\u2019s the address, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">and I\u2019ll add you to my access control list so you can go read too. Because I went and looked at you know, back entries on your LiveJournal. And he didn\u2019t respond to that, and that was Monday afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">You know, a sane person could you know, have prophesized like a dozen different reasons for why he hasn\u2019t responded. But the only one I have fixated on is you know, having read my Dreamweb he\u2019s just decided that I am just too crazy to date and wants nothing to do with me. And that\u2019s what I think. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019re crazy. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: And this is very worrying for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099762\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: What comes to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: (Sighs) (Pause from  to ) What do you mean what comes to mind? Just in general or?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I guess I\u2019m going from the sense that you seem worried, but maybe you might have something else? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s just because, I know. Because despite the fact that I haven\u2019t actually seen him in six years, we have friends in common you know. And I used to read his LiveJournal, and one of the things that he finds upsetting, to the point of being traumatizing in relationships is people who are <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">you know, very loud about being angry. Like, people who shout or yell, or are frequently angry. That\u2019s why he broke up with two of his recent exes. I tend to use my online journal as a place to vent and get out a lot of the anger. So that I\u2019m not carrying it around, like all day with people in my life. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">So my online journal is very angry and shouty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Like that\u2019s a big source of concern. Also, as much as he says that politics don\u2019t matter to him in choosing partners and dating. Our politics are kind of divergent. He is one of the less crazy brands of Libertarian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s relative. And as you might have guessed, my politics are far more on the socialist side of the scale than Libertarian in many regards. And I do blog about politics and thoughts, so it\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m nervous that I might have scared him off with my angry ranting and also my politics. I am also <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">wearing a t-shirt that says, \u201cMy Marxist, feminist dialectic brings all the boys to the yard\u201d. (Laughter) Which I find hilarious mostly because I am not a Marxist. My relationship to the word feminist is complicated. Let\u2019s leave it at that. I don\u2019t like calling myself a feminist for a variety of reasons. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">So the shirt if plenty of lies in that I don\u2019t have a Marxist, feminist dialectic. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: But how can you resist a shirt like that. I know I\u2019m definitely not reassuring, but I think that\u2019s funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s got you know, a silhouette of a woman giving a speech to a crowd and you know, they are all making the power fist in the air. It\u2019s the funniest shirt ever. Which I might convince myself would be hilarious to wear the next time I meet Thomas. (Chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">But yeah, I\u2019m worried that I have put him off by being, I don\u2019t know, too much of myself. Which you know, if I take a step back and think about it. If someone doesn\u2019t like me because I\u2019m being too much myself. That\u2019s not something I can change. It\u2019s probably best to find out early. Then on the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">hand, I want him to like me. And it worries me that he hasn\u2019t replied to my e-mails and it\u2019s been like three days. And last week he was replying to e-mails in three or four hours, if not instantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">We had an argument over e-mail about (inaudible). Where he was replying in you know, under 10 minute turnaround time. (Pause) Not an argument but (Pause), yeah argument is a totally wrong connotation. It was a playful argument. (Pause) But anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">(Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">I think I really want to e-mail him and ask him, did you look at my Dreamweb? What did you think? Why haven\u2019t you responded to my e-mail in three days? And I recognize that that\u2019s you know, crazy and not something that I should do, but. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099762\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I guess. (Pause from  to ) Yeah, I guess I\u2019m trying to put together like, you seem quite anxious and I think really want me to reassure you. And also I think really you know, like I\u2019m letting you twist in the wind and I don\u2019t. Back together with how you\u2019re feeling with Thomas, which is kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">of similarly I think you\u2019re like twisting in the wind and you want your feelings for him and (Pause) There\u2019s something there about how scary it is, I think in either case. To be left kind of on your own with you anxiety. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more to it than that. But there\u2019s a some way, that sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">of being abandoned (inaudible). (Pause) Is really quite not just anxious I think, but pretty disconcerting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: I think a lot of the time I want conformation that my judgment is sound. Like, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s really hard for me to have faith in my own decision making skills. I think it was actually Monday night when I was up doing my voice lesson. That\u2019s something, Victoria, my voice instructor has said <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">to me on many, many occasions. Is that I need to trust myself more that at least half of my problems with technique would disappear if I just trusted myself and was less hesitant, but if I had faith in the fact that my ear is good. I can hear notes. I can produce notes. I can sing the notes that I hear <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">and stop over thinking it and trying to think the note and consciously place the note, but trust myself. Which, with singing this is especially crap because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Pick out each note.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Because you can\u2019t pick out each note.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Well no because I\u2019ve spent so much time in my childhood being told that I didn\u2019t have an ear for music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Ah! Oh. That way. Sure. Right. I know you said that to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then also the spiral of dancing that I\u2019ve been doing recently, contra dancing. Well it\u2019s a called style. The caller tells you what steps you\u2019re going to dance. It\u2019s similar to square dancing in that regard, but they only call from the first eight measures of music. And then the caller <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">stops and lets you just dance and enjoy the music. And you have to have faith in yourself and in your dance partner and then everyone else in your set could be you know, up to thirty people, but people have learned the pattern by now and it\u2019s [0:26:07.1]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You keep doing -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: The same -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Repeating that what was called.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. And almost all the movements involve a great deal of spinning and moving and twirling and complicated geometric trace positions of dancer positions and all that. It\u2019s a great dance for geeks. But it does require you to just trust that your body has learned the steps and not overthink it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">because if you start thinking, \u201cOkay, I just did a trained butterfly and now I have to do a star, hold hands and try to think about what that means.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: You will completely foul the set and just let go.

Just differences and if they reflect badly on you.

That\u2019s shameful and you\u2019re grief stricken over feeling that way about yourself. And the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">anxiety, and a sort of wish for reassurance. (Pause) Like, you know, it\u2019s probably a good thing. It lets you be reassured and someone else is there. But it\u2019s like it\u2019s also sort of the person not really quite being there with what you\u2019re struggling with in a way.
