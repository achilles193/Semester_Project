data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: How are things going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I guess somewhat similar to last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: One thing I want to make sure, I guess, I do in my session today is to come up with something to, I guess, ask of Ivan to do once a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: As per (laughs) the deal we made with Dr. Farrow (sp)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: So I definitely want to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: You didn't meet with Ivan, I mean with Dr. Farrow (sp) last week, right? She's away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Or this week. She's on vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: So you've had some time give it thought. (laughs) (pause) Are there other things on you mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I know you often say (laughs) within five minutes before [you have to go] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: \"One thing I want to talk about.\" What else is on your mind, just so we make sure we get to everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Um. (sigh) Yeah. So I guess a lot. I feel like I'm being, lately I'm realizing at least, feeling very triggered by certain things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: And by triggered I just mean feeling that it's very much a repetition, feeling very, very worked up about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I'm just feeling kind of stuck in that I've made some progress here, but there are some things that are still, I don't know, they've been happening for a really long time and it's part of, I guess, what we've been trying to work on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: But it's hard to be patient sometimes with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: So I'm feeling some of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Triggers, the triggers specifically in things Ivan is doing or not doing. Is that what you're referring to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: (sigh) I think, yeah, by and large.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Or stuff you're doing yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think by and large with Ivan. But then I'm also noticing with myself feeling even more responsible for other people's things lately. Or feeling more, I don't know, more anxious or more, like even if things are going well, like the job search well whatever that means that feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">just like, \"I'm never going to get a job. This is the end of the world. Like this is horrible. I feel so horrible about myself.\" And just feeling Which is not new. But just a persistence of that, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: And, I don't know, I guess that's a lot of it. I also, I mean, talked with our parents recently, or my parents, and I need to go home at some point in July because I need to get my car inspected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: So I was talking with my sister about that. And then she got kind of worked up because my Mom is having some health problems. I mean she's okay, but she's having some health problems and just like the typical, \"What do we do when we go home?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Because we usually spend the whole time taking care of the house, helping with certain projects, mediating (laughs), and just it's really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: So I guess it's natural to feel a little triggered thinking about all of that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: and anticipating it, and planning. So I guess that's the summary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: Mm. Hm. (pause) That's a lot. I also am aware, and this relates to the unfolding of how things will go for you in the next few weeks. Dr. Farrow's (sp) back next week? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yes. This might be a place just to make sure we cover this as well, just to start, is my being away next week -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: and how that's going to feel to you. I know she's back. I was really happy when I found out. We checked in on our vacation times a month ago that they wouldn't overlap too much. But it's occurred to me that the person who is covering my practice is actually [Britney Keller] (ph), (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">so we should talk about whether or not we should come up with another name for you or I assume that would feel a little strange to see her if something came up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Or if seeing or talking to Dr. Farrow (sp) would feel sufficient. Would it just help to have another name? I want to check in with you about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Um. I don't know. I guess I feel a little, in theory it might be good. But I guess I feel a little reluctant because I've spent so long -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: and I guess you've spent so long, getting to know me and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: understanding what's going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: And I don't know how effective a forty five minute session with -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: For all intents and purposes, a complete stranger -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: would be. Not that they aren't, you know, good at their job. But I just wonder how much of that time I would just spend explaining my situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Which I totally agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: So just so you know, for the record, I was not suggesting that you set up an appointment with this person, but only that you have someone in case there were an emergency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Oh, oh, oh, oh. I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And if there was an emergency I think I would feel okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: You could talk to Dr. Farrow (sp)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that's fine. So thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: I just wanted to make sure because that would be weird if you called to get my covering person and then we hadn't talked about the fact that it was somebody you knew in a different context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: No, that's fine. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Dr. Farrow (sp) does know I'm away too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: The system, even Dr. Bourd (sp) knows, is aware kind of when people are in and out. So your issues around your going home, issues around Ivan -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: issues around your own self responsibility and trigger which relates to going home and Ivan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yep. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So I wonder, I guess I wonder if we start even with you, what's been happening? What have you been trying? I was looking over your list of cognitive distortions. I reviewed it and it occurred to me I should probably get that back to you to write down challenges for each one. Because so many <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A51\">of them are so active for you right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You were coming up with really good and current examples, that it sounds like figuring out what's an alternative way of thinking about this could help you during this very vulnerable time. You're in your first job hunt, so one of the first things I think cognitively is a strategy to keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A91\">in mind is that it's not always going to feel this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">You're going to find a job at some point. Even if it takes you two years. (laughs) I know that's horrible to say to you. But your professional development is going to unfold and it won't always feel this bad. But right now is the worst it's going to get.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: I think something I'm aware of So, for example, I have three short interviews tomorrow, all for the same job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: So this past week I got an interview scheduled, I met with somebody at the U (ph) who had a bunch of names of people they worked with -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: who do AIDS research, etc. So I got a bunch of names to e-mail, I did my job seekers workshop that I meet with every week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: I found a couple of more jobs and applied to them which was amazing because I was going for a while and just not finding anything that looked good to apply to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: that felt appropriate. So those would all sound like positive steps. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: But emotionally or, I don't know how to describe it, it feels the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: It feels just as kind of hopeless, depressing, anxious -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: as the week when I had no interviews, I found no new jobs to apply to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: I mean I still did the workshop. But you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">CLIENT: So it's like that would look like progress but it's not acceptable, it's not good enough. And I thought even if I would get this job tomorrow -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">THERAPIST: [The same.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">CLIENT: and that sounds like what I want to do. And in all fairness, I applied to it two months ago.

Evidently, because they just now called me for an interview.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">THERAPIST: [So interesting.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: So unless they have been interviewing for two months, yup. (laughs) So that's just like really, that's hard to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: And I just started, like I did orientation for another volunteer position which was great to add to my resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: Good skills to develop to apply to jobs. So like those would all sound like really good things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">CLIENT: But to me it feels the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Hm. Which is? How would you describe the thoughts and feelings? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">CLIENT: It feels hopeless. It feels like, I guess maybe the best way to describe it is, there's no belief that these steps will lead to a really, you know, a good job, a good paycheck, a good experience. a good There's no really firm underlying belief. There's a vague like, \"At some point I'll get a job.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">CLIENT: But it's more flooded with \"what if?\" It's not What if I have to take a (inaudible 00:08:41) job for now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">CLIENT: What if I have to (sigh) do a temp job? What if I And so I know that's me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">CLIENT: And that the tendency to focus on the negative as opposed to the positive, I know that's me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well it also sounds like, it reminds me of you and academics in your classes and in studying. The way you describe your study process was, it's as though you didn't have any history of having studied well and done well before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">THERAPIST: Each exam would be like the first exam you ever have taken. And the anxiety would be so high. And the feeling that you would have to cover everything and then some, and over and over and over and over again, and use every spare second until the exam comes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: Rather than What's missing is trust, sort of a built foundation of trust in yourself.

You don't trust that any of this is going to go anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: Yes. And I think a common thread is if, using the test example, if I could have read ahead into the future, if I could have done some fortune telling -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: and known I would get an A on the exam -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">CLIENT: with the studying I had done, you know, a few days before -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: instead of obsessing until the last minute, I still would have felt the need to obsess until the last minute because it would have felt shameful -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">CLIENT: or arrogant, or it would have -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">CLIENT: Right?

Would that be lazy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">CLIENT: Would it be, you know, a similar scenario.

Yeah. It's like you bring a you who has a whip out whipping yourself wherever you go. Whether it's going very well or not very well, it's the same whipping that's happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20135\">CLIENT: Well and I think it just keeps If I got this job offer tomorrow, instead of saying, \"I got a job offer and I've been working and things have been going a little better recently.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20139\">CLIENT: \"And now at least I have an option.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">CLIENT: I wouldn't say that.

Like maybe it really isn't a job that would be my first choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20143\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20145\">CLIENT: But there is a part of that is also, \"Is it ever going to be enough?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think, Ramona, even if you got the perfect job right now -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Not that any job is perfect, but a job that is like the best job that you can think of that is available right now and you got it. I think there would still be a way that voice would be with you. Quickly it would find something else to make you feel like you're not enough. It might even simply <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2014B1\">be, \"Okay, what am I going to do after this, because this is fine for a year but this isn't going to get me anywhere further.\" And, \"Why didn't I go to get my doctoral degree.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014F\">THERAPIST: You know? It's the running, it's like a tape of self-criticism that just shifts what to criticize depending on what's happening. That's really, really powerful. And the more you kind of start to recognize that it doesn't matter what you do, that voice is going to still be there. Because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2014F1\">think right now the voice convinces you that it's still like, \"No, there's still something factual that we're being critical of. And if this factual things changed then we would lighten up on you.\" I think it sometimes feels that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2014E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">CLIENT: It's really hard to separate out because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">CLIENT: the tape, as you call it. I feel like there's a component to it that is legitimate. Like you might not have, like, \"I really don't have any job offers now.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">CLIENT: Or, \"I really have not been applying to as many. It's been hard to find \" So there's a portion of it that feels legitimate. And there is a portion of it that I agree would be there no matter what. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Even the legitimate portions though, here's where I think the self-criticism would have legitimacy. Let's say you've been sitting burying your head in the bed for a month and haven't gotten any applications out because you were so depressed you couldn't do anything. Okay? Or it had <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B1\">been two years of applying and you still hadn't gotten anywhere. Or somehow every day you went to go look for jobs and you just couldn't and you watched TV instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">That would be, okay, you're not doing enough. Right? And we have to help you do more so that you're doing enough to keep up with things. But that's not what you're describing, Ramona.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I do feel like there are some days, especially I'm thinking of, I guess, not this past week but the week before where I really didn't, I don't know if I applied to any jobs that week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">THERAPIST: And why not that week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">CLIENT: (sigh) Because I just got so gosh darn frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20167\">CLIENT: And I found myself not finding ones to apply to. And I did find myself on my laptop ending up doing other things because I just got so sick of looking through job board after job board and not finding. And I feel like that's an excuse because, you know, it is what it is. I can't just not keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201671\">looking because I went through a few job boards and there was nothing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016B\">CLIENT: But I'm not (sigh) having the, for whatever reason, I just don't want to sit in front of a laptop any more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016F\">CLIENT: Even to do non-job search things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20171\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">CLIENT: And sometimes it's just so overwhelming and so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20175\">THERAPIST: So I think if only this critic weren't so bad. Because actually, Ramona, what you're describing sounds very reasonable to me. You've searched and searched and searched, and applied and searched and applied and searched as much as you can. And then you took a week off from doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20177\">CLIENT: But it wasn't even But then -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20179\">THERAPIST: You couldn't conceptualize it as a week off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017B\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017D\">THERAPIST: But not only did you take a week maybe to get Who doesn't get tired sitting at their laptop all day long? Most people need to have some time where they say, \"Okay, I don't care what else is out there, I have to go get away from this,\" for one. Two, my guess is your brain actually was making <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2017D1\">some calculations about the fact that in the past several days hardly anything had come up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017F\">So the idea that taking a break, maybe there was room to take a break because you've exhausted, for a little bit, looking at things. And you might want to wait some time, let some things get posted again, and then start applying again. Do you know what I'm saying? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2017E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2017E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">CLIENT: I do. I even find myself in the days or the time when I take a break -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">CLIENT: Like yesterday I helped my sister get ready because she's going to be moving in a few weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">CLIENT: So I didn't do any jobs yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">THERAPIST: You helped her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018D\">CLIENT: Right. (laughs) That was great. But then sometimes there are days when, and Saturday I did. So Saturday and Sunday I did not do any job stuff, even though I'm actually excited because I now have, like there's another job I've worked on the application and I'm getting ready to submit it. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2018D1\">I find myself being critical. Like, \"I took this day to relax, but did I really spend the day really relaxing or did I waste it just watching random TV.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20191\">CLIENT: Or did I, like, \"Was the apartment clean before I relaxed.\" Like did I really, actually thoroughly relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20193\">THERAPIST: Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! Yes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20195\">CLIENT: So it goes the other way. Like, \"Did I work hard enough? Did I really relax?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20197\">THERAPIST: Did you relax well enough? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20199\">CLIENT: Did I maximize the time. And, I don't know, I guess I'm feeling stuck because the ways in which I would usually feel good about myself for doing things are completely absent now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">CLIENT: No job, no school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">CLIENT: The most I can do is clean the apartment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">CLIENT: I don't even feel good when I was doing job applications so much because I haven't gotten a single offer. I've done all these applications, no offer. It's like I could have never done them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">CLIENT: Not like I could have never done them, but it hasn't yielded anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah. That's the pigeon analogy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD\">CLIENT: (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF\">THERAPIST: That it won't unless you keep doing it, but it's very infrequent reinforcement. You're left with your core sense of yourself right now. That's, in your mind, really, really not good. The ways you've compensated for that are by doing well in school, succeeding, achieving, A's, studying. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF1\">without that and without the immediate reward right now, \"Okay, I put in job applications, I got the interviews, I got the job,\" to make you feel good about yourself and sort of check for having efficacy in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B3\">THERAPIST: You don't know what to do and how to feel about yourself.

And the worst, I don't want to say the worst part, but something that does not feel very good is Ivan does not ask like, \"So how many applications?\" Or, \"Did you find any good jobs?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B9\">CLIENT: Sometimes he will ask a really generic question or I'll just tell him.

And right now it feels a little more like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202AF\">CLIENT: I was definitely a small fish in a big pond in grad school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B3\">CLIENT: But it didn't always feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B5\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B7\">CLIENT: Some pretty small classes. But then now it feels like I'm -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B9\">THERAPIST: Hm. Like you mean an even smaller fish in an even bigger pond? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202BB\">CLIENT: Yup. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Some of it is the reality of how the world is an enormous pond and you're not alone in feeling like a small fish. That every person is a small fish. I think there is a way you take that reality and then make it be something bad about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202BF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202C1\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202C3\">CLIENT: I mean I'm already thinking, I started on this research study in February, and I'm thinking, \"Why wasn't I doing that last February?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202C5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202C7\">CLIENT: Why wasn't \" I just, like I went to this orientation for this volunteer thing at BMC. And there are juniors in college who are volunteering. Not for the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202C9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202CB\">CLIENT: But I don't know if they'd be able to do the same thing, or be allowed rather. But I'm thinking, \"Why wasn't I volunteering at some major hospital when I was junior in college?\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202CD\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202CF\">CLIENT: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202D1\">THERAPIST: What's the answer to that? If you follow that, what's the reality about why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N202D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D3\">CLIENT: Well I did internships at vet clinics which, if you want to do research in a hospital they don't care as much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. And at the time, do you know why you did that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D7\">CLIENT: Because I was pre-vet. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202D9\">THERAPIST: Yes. There you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202DB\">CLIENT: Yep. I mean I still looked at jobs at the, like over at Angel at Tufts Veterinary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202DF\">CLIENT: But a lot of them aren't, they're not where I'm at exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202E1\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202E3\">CLIENT: So I would be really far above or really like cleaning exam rooms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But, so in other words, here's a really classic of example of where you can get into that your current life, seeing someone else got specific experience in your field in your college. \"Why didn't I do that?\" The why you didn't do that, there's a very good reason, Ramona. You didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202E51\">even know you were going to be doing this. (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202E7\">CLIENT: But that's the other unacceptable element. I don't know what ultimately what my dream job is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202E9\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202EB\">CLIENT: I don't know ultimately what, you know, do I have my last degree now? When am I going to do another one in the future? What is it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202ED\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202EF\">CLIENT: Like that's not acceptable to me to not have, especially given, like I said I got really triggered a lot this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F1\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F3\">CLIENT: The other night I was doing job stuff and Ivan got on his laptop and sat on the couch. And he just looked up jobs by a salary number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F7\">CLIENT: And that, in and of itself, isn't maybe a huge deal. Like he was just curious what a certain salary range, what those jobs might look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202F9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202FB\">CLIENT: But for me, I just lost it. I just, like inside of me there was something that just, it was like the end of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202FD\">THERAPIST: It felt so unfocussed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202FF\">CLIENT: So unbelievably unfocussed. Not even like, \"No, just a number.\" And I just, I couldn't do it. I'm like, \"Wow. He is twenty six. He has no clue what he wants to do.\" He's not even trying to search by job category, let alone title. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20301\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20303\">CLIENT: It's just like, I don't know. I could not handle it. And maybe that's not fair, but I just could not handle it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20305\">THERAPIST: Well I think that one of the things that comes up when you feel that strongly towards some part of him is that maybe there's a piece of the feeling you're having for him that is also for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20307\">CLIENT: That's the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20309\">THERAPIST: That's what you're describing feeling towards you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2030B\">CLIENT: That's the problem. If I had, I could have a little more room for him to have no clue what he wants to do, a little more room -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2030D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2030F\">CLIENT: if I had a very exact, very detailed plan for myself with real outcomes. If I was enrolled in a PhD program and had a full time job and, you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20311\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20313\">CLIENT: knew that I was going to be coming out with x, y and z in five years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20315\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20317\">CLIENT: That would feel much more acceptable. That at this point I'm the one who doesn't have a job right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20319\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2031B\">CLIENT: I don't have anything definite and he's over there like, \"Whatever.\" You know, just searching by Like totally not applying to any of those jobs. Just looking at what they might be. (sigh) I know that sounds, it is, it's very unforgiving, it's very harsh. But to me it felt representative of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2031B1\">a much bigger problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2031A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2031A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2031D\">THERAPIST: The person I think you're harshest on of anyone in the world is yourself, Ramona. You and Ivan are quite different, you are not in the same category about where you are with job searches. You're not struggling the way he struggles to find focus and to find direction and to be on top of things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2031D1\">You just aren't. You might some weeks a little bit. That is within the range of normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2031F\">Every person looking for a job struggles some weeks some. No one perfectly does thirty five hours a week. Not a single soul on the face of the earth does that. Right? That's called trying to strive for some perfection that doesn't exist. I think when you fall off of being absolutely perfect, you feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2031F1\">like you're somehow doing what he's doing. Which is not the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20321\">You are not searching by salary. You would hope you might if you were curious and that would be okay. And maybe if he were doing a great job search otherwise and then just one day wanted to search by salary because he was curious, that would be a different story. That's not what you're saying is happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203211\">with him, right? There's something, it's a symptom of his being unfocussed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20323\">You are not unfocussed. You are hyper focused and hyper critical. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20325\">CLIENT: But it's just, I guess it's feeling hard to meet somewhere in the middle. And it feels like Ivan is slowly coming up in some of those skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20327\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20329\">CLIENT: But to me, and I recognize that this is critical and unfair and in reality he is making progress at a significant rate, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2032B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2032D\">CLIENT: But it feels like way too slow. It feels unacceptable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2032F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20331\">CLIENT: It feels like the same stuff over and over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20333\">THERAPIST: And yet that might also might be a symptom of your being really, really critical still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20335\">CLIENT: It might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20337\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20339\">CLIENT: It might -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033B\">THERAPIST: Because forget towards him. You are that way towards yourself when we know it's not really rational.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033D\">CLIENT: But I don't think I apply my standards to myself to Ivan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2033F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20341\">CLIENT: I don't know that that really happens. I find myself settling more and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20343\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20345\">CLIENT: But I'm genuinely freaked out by things like him searching by a salary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20347\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20349\">CLIENT: Or that there have been a couple times now where if he wakes up he doesn't know what day it is. He doesn't know what's going on. He's totally disoriented and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034D\">CLIENT: And that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034F\">THERAPIST: Your worst nightmare. [That's what you were saying.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20351\">CLIENT: (laughs) I can't, I don't know what to do. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20353\">THERAPIST: With him. Let's focus on that for a second because we're going to run out of time and I want to make sure you leave with that and a couple of other things. What do you think you would like to ask him to do? What would be helpful to you and your self-criticism and anxiety and depression that you have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20355\">CLIENT: I don't actually know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20357\">THERAPIST: What can he do for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20359\">CLIENT: I don't feel like I even want there to be something because I can't I know it's unfair. I really do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035D\">CLIENT: But I can't handle there being one more reasonable, understandable thing that I ask him to do that does not happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20361\">CLIENT: Because I've just felt an unreal amount (laughs) of being triggered the other day when the exact same thing happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20360-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20360-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20363\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20365\">CLIENT: I just can't do it anymore. I'd rather I'm really coming back to the place I am with my parents where, in reality, the way to get along or the way to have peace is to lower the expectation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20367\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20369\">CLIENT: Don't ask. Like stop asking them to clean the house. Stop asking him to take out the trash. Like just stop because it's not going to lead to anything other than a fight and disappointment and just feeling really crummy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2036B\">THERAPIST: So how do you put that together, though, with that he is making changes that you can feel palpably? Or he's doing some things better than ever before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2036D\">CLIENT: I think that's what I'm saying. I'm not doing a good job of putting those things together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2036F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20371\">CLIENT: Especially, again, I think it's unfair of me, but right now it feels like he's putting in the effort in places not for marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20373\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20375\">CLIENT: It feels like he'll try to take his medication to go to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20377\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20379\">CLIENT: He will not take it at home.

I know that it's really hard for him to take the medication. I know he feels self-conscious. And I know I do not dare to say, \"It would be really great to see if, you know, you could be more organized or focused at home.\" You know? Like, \"That would be nice for us.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20383\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20385\">CLIENT: I can't say that. But (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20387\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. So you don't want to think of anything that he could do? Is that what your answer is? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20389\">CLIENT: No, there's a part of me that does, but I'm just so incredibly done with -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2038B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2038D\">CLIENT: I find myself (sigh) What happened this week was I said, which I've said so many times, \"You know, maybe we could each do part of cleaning the apartment \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2038F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20391\">CLIENT: \" instead of me cleaning the entire apartment.\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20393\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20395\">CLIENT: And it goes from there to, \"Do you want to help for just a little bit,\" to \"You could do this.\" \"Okay, why don't you just mop the kitchen and the bathroom floor. They're tiny. It will take like twenty minutes max.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20397\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20399\">CLIENT: And, guess what, it still hasn't happened. (laughs) Days later he still hasn't. And I just, it was such an acute, that's exactly what I've always been doing with my parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I understand you're afraid to ask him to do something more. Do you want to not do the homework assignment then? Do you think it's just you're too emotionally stressed right now to try it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039D\">CLIENT: I can try it. I just feel like it's It would be reasonable to expect that that would not be a consistent happening considering the baseline is not consistently happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A1\">CLIENT: I don't know why I would think that more would be the answer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A3\">THERAPIST: Well, if it's an assignment. So, in other words, if it's put in front of him, \"This is what you're going to be asked to do every day.\" And you agree to this in front of Dr. Farrow (sp). And then you go home and he doesn't do it. She gets to take it up more with him in the couples therapy then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A5\">CLIENT: There will be no consequences.

Anything I say you reject.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203AD\">CLIENT: Maybe.

That's actually been your experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B5\">CLIENT: Yes. And so saying, \"But, Ramona, just give it one more chance. Just add one more thing to the 'To Do' list.\" It's like then the criticism is on me, not him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. For the record, I've said this before over and over, you're very patient with something very real that is his deficit. That's really happening. I'm only bringing this up because you said you wanted to make sure we found time to figure something out. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203B9\">CLIENT: (laughs) No, I'm sure I need to do that. I just hate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BB\">THERAPIST: But you might not. Maybe what you're saying, maybe what you needed to do is talk it out and realize maybe what you're feeling is so frustrated that, why on earth would you do this homework assignment when you've done this before and he doesn't do it? Maybe that's what you need to go back <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203BB1\">and say to Dr. Farrow (sp) again. That he does not follow through so you're feeling hopeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BD\">I think I You're the one who knows what is happening better than I do and better than Dr. Farrow (sp) does. So I'm listening to you saying sometimes it feels like there have been real changes and sometimes it feels like nothing has changed, that it's the same old person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BF\">To the degree that there have been real changes, that's the side of me that would hope maybe this would help him. And I'm not talking about something like cleaning. I was thinking more along the lines of him saying, \"So how is the job search going,\" once a day. Just asking you something about it. Or, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203BF1\">\"How are you? How was your day?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C1\">CLIENT: Which I think is a great idea, in theory, but the homework she has been giving us -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C5\">CLIENT: like even the \"money meeting\" once a week, it happens when I say, \"Ivan, we're going to sit down and do this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C9\">CLIENT: And quite frankly, I'm seriously angry about saying those words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CD\">CLIENT: I am seriously up to here with being his Mom.

It was supposed to be mutual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203DB\">THERAPIST: Okay. So that's to me the only thing that's different. Is this would be his assignment and you cannot remind him to do it. And then you take a tally over seven days. \"Did he do it seven days out of seven or did he not do it?\" In other words, if he doesn't do it you're not going to go, \"Remember, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203DB1\">Ivan. You have to ask my how my day went.\" You're not supposed to that in this kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N203DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203DC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203DD\">CLIENT: We've done that before.

But then eventually it just doesn't happen and we're back to square one and what am I It feels, I don't know, it feels critical of me because I'm not supposed to ask for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203EF\">THERAPIST: (cross talking at 00:40:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F1\">CLIENT: I'm not supposed to do it myself. I'm not supposed to criticize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F3\">THERAPIST: And he's actually not doing it. Ramona, he's actually not doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F5\">CLIENT: I'm just supposed to let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F7\">THERAPIST: I feel your frustration. You're just caught between a rock and hard place right now that is a repetition of your childhood. It's not just your transference to it. It's actually happening and I think that's what is so hard and sad, and hard to face in a way. What if you have found yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203F71\">with someone who is repeating the same patterns? And you didn't know you were getting into this but this is what you're in. What do you do then? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F9\">You know, I think in your childhood you turned to criticizing yourself, probably from a very, very young age, in order to kind of make up for the ways in which all the people around you who were supposed to loving you and taking care of you were not. And that criticizing yourself became a very familiar <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203F91\">and comfortable way of keeping order in your life. Whipping yourself into shape, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203FA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203FB\">You then don't have to If you're in the constant pain of self-flagellation, you don't really have to think about other people not doing their jobs as much. It doesn't really have to hurt as much that other people can't do the bare minimum to demonstrate loving, affection and taking care of you. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203FB1\">I think you're finding the same things happening with Ivan right now. And in some ways it's pushing you further into the corner of self-flagellation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203FC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203FD\">CLIENT: Because what else would you have me do? Like the one message I consistently hear is that I'm not to criticize to Ivan. I'm not supposed to ask him to do his stuff no matter what. I'm not, like we're not supposed to even talk about the elephants in the room most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203FE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203FF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20400\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20401\">CLIENT: Or we just don't because I'm not supposed to initiate it. And heaven knows he's not. And so where else does that go? (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20402\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20403\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Some of that is maybe coming from couples therapy. I don't agree with all I think you should have expectations of him. I think you should be sharing disappointment. I think you should be giving him assignments and when he then doesn't do it, and it was a hundred percent on him <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N204031\">and you keep your mouth shut, you get to come in and say, \"This is not changing fast enough.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20404\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20405\">CLIENT: But I don't think that changes But saying that, what does that do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20406\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20407\">THERAPIST: What if it does nothing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20408\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20409\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's where I'm at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2040A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2040B\">THERAPIST: That's what it sounds like you're coming up against. What if his change rate is way, way too slow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2040C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2040D\">CLIENT: I think I need to find some room to be more patient. I just don't know how to do that, especially without me hating myself more.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N2040C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2040C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2040E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2040F\">THERAPIST: Mm. You just said something so important because I think that's the only way you've developed patience over your life. The only way to not feel angry at these people is to go back and turn it all in against yourself. So that's so, I think that's incredibly insightful, what you just said. <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2040F1\">How can there be some space where you get to find patience for yourself and for another person at the same time? I think that's a really, really, really big question. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20410\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20411\">That could even come up in here too. Like you could be feeling today critical of me. Like I know this kind of session. We've had this kind of session before where you will leave often and feel fed up and frustrated and this is a waste of time. And that the criticism comes out at me or it's going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N204111\">go back at you. And, you know, I'm not doing enough. I somehow didn't make enough of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20412\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20413\">Hopefully, we've changed a little bit. We changed gears I think about ten minutes ago. We started to talk about this in a different way. How on earth do you have time and patience that is held compassionately, lovingly for both you and Ivan? Where you're in something together that's important to both <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N204131\">of you right now, that you don't want to leave. And some changes are happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20414\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20415\">But there are some things that are happening that are still so frustrating and feels unbearable sometimes. It's likes trying to grow a little bit of safe space that you knew nothing about as a child, Ramona, nothing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20416\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20417\">CLIENT: I still don't always I know this is flawed thinking, but I still don't always see the point in separating like, \"This is their responsibility.\" Or, you know, this is someone else's responsibility. If they aren't doing it, it has nothing to do with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20418\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20419\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2041A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2041B\">CLIENT: It's really hard. It actually sometimes even doesn't feel like there's any point to reaching that level of consistent intellectual understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2041C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2041D\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2041E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2041F\">CLIENT: Because, at the end of the day, the floors still need to get mopped. (laughs) At the end of the day, bills still need to get paid. At the end of the day, like what's the point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20420\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20421\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20422\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20423\">CLIENT: And is there any point in reframing it as the rate at which Ivan is making progress doesn't feel very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20424\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20425\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20426\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20427\">CLIENT: Or it doesn't always feel fast enough versus it's my fault for not being patient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20428\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20429\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2042A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2042B\">CLIENT: Is there any point in Pick one. Does it make any difference really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2042C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2042D\">THERAPIST: See I don't think either of those is the total truth though. Do you know what I mean? I think he's working on his deficit and you're working on yours. (pause) And the reason I reframe it like that is that I think one of the (sigh) How to put this? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2042E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2042F\">The deficit that is in you that you bring to the table with the relationship with him, and with any relationship, is how hard you are on yourself. I think that is the central, core problem inside you. It's not how critical you are of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20430\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20431\">CLIENT: But would being less critical of myself actually improve my relationships at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20432\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20433\">THERAPIST: I think it would. But how you get there is another question. Because this is where to me cognitive therapy falls a little short for you. Because it's not a matter of just saying, \"Okay, go home, Ramona, and be less critical of yourself.\" If you could do that you would do it already. Right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N204331\">It's not just a switch you get to turn off in your brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N20432-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20432-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20434\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20435\">You've identified being critical of yourself is safe. It is your protection in the world. You don't even know what your world would feel like if you could hold yourself and give yourself a hug in this process, and love yourself with compassion during this job search. That's so foreign to you to actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N204351\">be held lovingly and affectionately. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20436\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20437\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20438\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20439\">THERAPIST: You survived in your family by being critical of yourself. I often think, if there is a cognitive therapy intervention around this that might do something, the number of times you've said, \"I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself.\" They have literally done studies where <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N204391\">you can look in the mirror and if you say, \"I hate myself,\" a hundred times, your mood drops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043B\">So we have someone without depression, right? And that you can actually show an effect of change, a negative effect, if you get them to say something that they don't even believe. Right? This is someone who comes in with a good self-concept. Get them to say that a hundred times, their mood will drop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043D\">If we were to start trying to find some statement you could say to yourself that would become more of a mantra about yourself. Forget Ivan. But something that you could find that is a more compassionate self-statement that we want to actually start pulling out, \"I hate myself.\" Because I think it can <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2043D1\">become a kind of obsessional ritual in your head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20440\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20441\">THERAPIST: And if we could actually, to the degree that you can, turn that off and find a competing statement. I don't know what statement that would be because it's got to be something you can be interested in, at least. I know you won't believe it at first, but something that sounds like, \"Okay, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N204411\">could at least repeat that a number of times to myself.\" So maybe could you try to come up with something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20442\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20443\">CLIENT: I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20444\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20445\">THERAPIST: \"I love myself.\" \"I love this about myself.\" \"I'm doing the best I can.\" \"I'm a good person.\" These are examples. Something along those lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20446\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20447\">CLIENT: I can try to do that. I think part of the negative, the reason the self-hate is so adaptive for me is because then if I feel really crummy about the way things are or aren't happening outside of what I have control over, I have control over that really awful feeling. As opposed to letting it <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N204471\">go and saying, \"That's on them. They control it. I can't \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20448\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20449\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044B\">CLIENT: (laughs) So I'm not sure I know that's part of the problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044D\">THERAPIST: That's why I think even giving you a substitute thought, you can control that thought if you want to. Like it might be, \"I'm doing the best I can.\" Something like that that doesn't say, \"I'm doing great,\" because maybe you don't believe that. But, \"I'm doing the best I can.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20450\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20451\">THERAPIST: And try to see if you can write that. Maybe even you could type it out, print it, put it on your computer. That might not even be a good one. When you think of what feels like it's something you're willing to try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20452\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20453\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20454\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20455\">THERAPIST: Drop me a line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20456\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20457\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20458\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20459\">THERAPIST: And try that for a couple of weeks. So we're not meeting next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2045A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2045B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2045C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2045D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2045E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2045F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N2045E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2045E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560314\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20460\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20461\">THERAPIST: See you then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20462\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20463\">CLIENT: Do you want to give back my?
