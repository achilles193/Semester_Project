Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Or we could do...

(therapist affirms) The 30th... at 2:30, you said? (therapist affirms) (pause) So, yeah. A week ago, I was... enjoying an earthquake in Arizona, from the 11th floor of a hotel room. That was... unlike anything... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Enjoying, you said? (chuckles) Experiencing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Experiencing. Yeah, well, you know, I can say... I\u2019ve had that and... it was insane. I mean it was, the whole building was rocking back and forth, you couldn\u2019t even walk without holding onto something. It was just... moving so quickly. It lasted for a minute. Plaster was falling off the walls <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">onto the stairs, going down in bare feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Wow! That sounds scary!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It was very scary. I didn\u2019t think I was actually going to live. And I don\u2019t say that lightly. I mean, I seriously... going down the stairs and two floors below, the plaster slid off the wall, and crashed onto the stairs, somebody screamed. I didn\u2019t know what it was, and so I thought like, floors <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">were collapsing. (therapist affirms) (pause) Yeah, it was just... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Were you alone? I mean, obviously, you were with other people, but were you...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: No, Julie was there with me. This was her second one, actually. She had been in one in \u201893. It was... worse, 8.5. Anyway, it was... quite an event, so... That... in addition to the idea that that week was going to be, for me, like this kind of (chuckles) rebirth... really became more real. (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">(pause) And I sent off the letter to my Dad the day... Monday, the day we left. It was nine pages, in the end and... (pause) I got an e-mail from him on Thursday, saying he had received it. (pause) He was... needs a few days to respond, because he\u2019s still taking in all the information, to re-read it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">and he would reply from Michigan. (pause) Didn\u2019t you go to Michigan or something? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I went to Michigan University.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, so he lives in...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I wondered; you were looking around like, \u201cIs he hearing voices?\u201d Is like, new, that I need to...? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like the earthquake, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) crooked (ph) diplomas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so he drove back with his wife, and they arrived two days ago, Wednesday. So... I haven\u2019t gotten anything yet, and didn\u2019t suspect I would this quickly. So... that\u2019s kind of where it sits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I mean, he\u2019s doing that you asked, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Absolutely. I mean, I\u2019m not surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Taking his time to absorb, as you wanted him to. I mean, so much thought and time and (client affirms) energy went into the letter. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know, I... for a few moments... I don\u2019t know, I think it was before I knew he had received it, I was feeling kind of bad like, you know, \u201cWas it really necessary to put some of those things in there?\u201d And (sighs), you know, I think that\u2019s my first inclination normally, is to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">just, you know, has, with regard to this, has been just kind of like, \u201cWell... you haven\u2019t even been letting him feel bad about it,\u201d or whatever. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">And then I got to thinking, you know (sighs)... this is something that I couldn\u2019t even share with my siblings, because of shame. I didn\u2019t ask for that. That inability to feel like I can open up or talk to people in my own family about this... is... is... you know, it\u2019s just not right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been crippling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: It is. I has been. So I thought, \u201cWell, you know what? For him to feel bad for a week, two weeks, whatever it is, a month... it pales in comparison to what, the handicap I\u2019ve lived with for so long,\u201d so... That was... that. And... So, yeah. I mean, I think in some ways... I do feel like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">a weight lifted off of me, and I don\u2019t expect to really enjoy the fruits of that until I hear his response, when that comes in. But... at the same time, it\u2019s no longer me... holding back emotions from him, whether it be love or anger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve let yourself be honest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and you know, the past few years I\u2019ve kind of felt somewhat distanced. I mean, I have distanced myself in some ways from him, so... (pause) And I didn\u2019t enjoy that. (pause) So... yeah. I mean, I think... (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">(pause) You know, I\u2019ve been sick, from Arizona, it\u2019s this GI problem. You know, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever experienced it, but when you\u2019re sick or you have the flu and you have a cough or cold, whatever; after a while, you just get so tired of being sick, that you say, \u201cOkay, you know what? I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">sick anymore! I\u2019m just going to start acting like I\u2019m not sick, because this is, you know... burdensome,\u201d you know? It\u2019s just... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">You start... getting up in the morning and you, you know, shower, you do everything as if you were not sick. It kind of dawned on me that that is... a likely... way to approach this. You know, I can suffer from actual illness for a while, but I can\u2019t just... suffer with it forever, and for me to just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">(pause) act the part of a normal person, a healthy person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I think there are some ways in which our... you do make the parallel between physical sickness and mental sickness, right? There are, you know, when you\u2019re sick, you typically, you know, you have no appetite, you don\u2019t eat. There is a point at which that is actually may be helpful. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">if you\u2019re vomiting all the time, eating is not really a great choice. (client affirms) But then there are a point at which, if you don\u2019t start eating, you won\u2019t get better. (client affirms) You know, your body needs energy and fuel, and you feel horrible when you haven\u2019t eaten, and your blood sugar <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">is low, and you\u2019re shaky and weak and dizzy, right? That\u2019s not good either. (client affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">So there is a point at which the caretaking behavior actually becomes reinforcing of the illness or symptoms. The illness may actually have progressed and you\u2019re fine (client affirms), but you feel weak and dizzy, and you don\u2019t want to get out of bed, because you haven\u2019t eaten for three days. (client <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">affirms) And I think that, with depression and anxiety, it\u2019s very similar. There are some behaviors that you have because you feel bad. You isolate, perhaps. Maybe you don\u2019t get out of bed and shower and get dressed. They\u2019re protective in a way, but they\u2019re also reinforcing. Being able to discern when <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">it\u2019s useful to actually push yourself to get up, to shower, to eat, to go out and exercise, to go talk to somebody; when that\u2019s actually helpful, and it\u2019s actually part of the healing process, and you don\u2019t need to be... doing kind of the sick behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, and I know that sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And then there are times when you realized, \u201cNo, actually I do need to still be in bed.\u201d (client affirms) Maybe it\u2019s a chicken soup day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just, you know, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be outside, but I have to go back in.\u201d But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, being able to question, and then try it out and figure out, discern, \u201cIs this, am I helping myself or am I hurting myself?\u201d (client affirms) Because sometimes the same behavior can be both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s interesting how, just a mind shift can make it clear. (therapist affirms) Or just asking the question and trying it out. So... (sighs) Yeah, I guess... (pause) I\u2019m not sure if this is just telling myself this, or if I\u2019m actually believing it, but I think it\u2019s true that... I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">need to walk around as this victim. Not so much that I\u2019ve felt sorry for myself, but I think I kind of acted as a leper, you know. I just, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, I\u2019m unworthy, I\u2019m...,\u201d you know... And (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">(pause) You know, sure I\u2019m sure I felt sorry for myself at times, but... I also think the opposite, the... (chuckles) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being cautious for other people\u2019s sake, you know, to be like, you know, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time with me, because I\u2019m not worth it,\u201d blah blah blah. I think... that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">I don\u2019t need to live with that anymore, I don\u2019t need to... act as if I\u2019m... irreparable or unredeemable and... or just simply unredeemed... because... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">(pause) You know, at this point in my life, I\u2019m just tired of being sick, \u201csick.\u201d (pause) At the same time, I still feel like I am vulnerable to past behaviors, past ruts (sighs), but I know that... falling into an old pattern isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. I think you\u2019ve taught me that. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">But I think I... it\u2019s just been a challenge for me to actually build in... structures, and stick with them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And keep them there. (client affirms) (pause) What\u2019s been the most stable structure? Of the things you\u2019ve put in place, what\u2019s stuck and most consistent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I think going to the gym (chuckles), which I haven\u2019t been in two weeks, because I\u2019ve been out of town and I\u2019ve been sick. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) But that\u2019s, those are realistic...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: ...other than that, (inaudible), you know, I feel bad about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: No, those are realistic barriers. (client affirms) I mean, being in another country sort of makes going to your gym out of the question. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah, plus if you\u2019re like, walking up and checking out pyramids.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: (affirms) That counts as exercise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: At an altitude of, you know, mile high.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Exercise counts in places other than a gym.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, so, you know, that, when I feel like, okay... (pause) But I don\u2019t know. I... Part of me says, \u201cWell, you know, how can you expect to have structure as something consistent, regularly, you know? Falling into old behaviors, old patterns. You just need to keep trying.\u201d And (sighs), you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">like going to the gym or like being well, those things, whatever, getting enough sleep... (sighs) For whatever reason, I don\u2019t value them very much, you know. I know they\u2019re good for me, I know they are.

I think it\u2019s kind of one and the same, to me, because these... it\u2019s like, these things are me, you know.

That was really successful and that... you know, that carried me a long way. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess just, it\u2019s just life, you know? I\u2019m not always going to be motivated to do the work that I want to do or do the things that I know are good for me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">so... what else am I supposed to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well, I think, and there is a difference between \u201calways\u201d and \u201cconsistent.\u201d (client affirms) So, I mean, having a structure in place does not necessarily mean that you have to do it every single day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean, it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: It means it has to be the, that having it there is the baseline, but the baseline is not 100%. (client affirms) It can\u2019t be, because nobody, you can\u2019t expect perfection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know, but... there is something in there, and I\u2019m just kind of grazing it earlier, but I couldn\u2019t quite... put my finger on it. Something about... having structure... as a... as a goal, and yet falling short of that goal. (pause) I\u2019m not sure if I can put it into words. Falling short <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">of that goal... is human and I shouldn\u2019t get down on myself about that, but... (pause) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s... (pause) I\u2019m still tossing it around. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: You shouldn\u2019t feel... don\u2019t feel bad about falling short, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s just it. I can\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s hanging there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t, yeah, it\u2019s still kind of... batting about in my head, it\u2019s like... (pause) I guess there are hints of, \u201cIs the structure... for me?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Maybe structure is not a good goal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: God, I hope not! (chuckles) I\u2019ve put so much stock in it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) Well, I wonder if it needs to be framed differently? To put it in another, you know, sometimes it\u2019s easier to look at examples outside your own life. So, for me, over vacation, I set a goal to run a certain number of miles. As the vacation wore on, I realized that, in order to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">achieve that goal, there were going to need to be some pretty extreme runs the last two days of vacation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">As I looked at like, \u201cOkay, so it was a good goal.\u201d Part of why I set that goal is, you know, for me, running is something I don\u2019t get to do as much as I want in my regular life, it\u2019s time alone, you know. There are good, you know, it\u2019s not punishment to pick a number. But, you know, as the days wore <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">on, I said, \u201cWell... I would have to make a choice. I could do that. It would be realistic, I mean, I could do that without hurting myself and make this number goal I\u2019ve set. Or I could choose to do something else with the time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">In the end, I chose to do something else with the time those mornings, and not hit the number that I had set for myself. I can look at that in two ways. I can look at it as failure. It was an absolutely achievable goal to run the number of miles I had set. That would have been doable for me. So, failed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">Or, I could look at it and say, \u201cThere were a number of things that were important to me to experience over the course of that vacation.\u201d What I did is I determined my priorities, and maybe that, that was success, because what I did was I chose very carefully how I wanted to spend the time. (client affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">When you\u2019re looking at the structure goal, you know, for you, \u201cnumber of miles\u201d is gym, going to bed at a reasonable hour and getting good sleep, eating healthfully. When you choose not to do one of those things, when you choose something to eat that maybe isn\u2019t in your healthy list, but it\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">else; is that failure, or is it still a carefully chosen choice for honoring something else? Maybe sometimes, it is, and sometimes it\u2019s not. Maybe sometimes going to the gym or deciding not to go to the gym, but to do something else is still a health-driven choice for you, or... is it failure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: (sighs) You know, something that... something that occurred to me when I was on vacation was, I had typed it out, because I... (pause) \u201cIt\u2019s not the act of failing which is so deadly, it\u2019s the penalty applied for failing.\u201d I don\u2019t know why a penalty, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What is the penalty? What would feeling guilty about not running my number do for me? It\u2019s a guilt you give yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, it\u2019s not, you know, like what, it\u2019s not like... you know, not running isn\u2019t the thing that gets me, it\u2019s feeling like I can never not fail, you know. The punishment for that is just... too much to bear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: It ends up affecting way more than choosing not to (client affirms) go to the gym, eat that particular meal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s deadly. (pause) You know, as you were talking about, \u201cWell, I could, there were a number of things that were important to me,\u201d that, for me personally, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, this is just rationalizing my weakness,\u201d or whatever and, you know. (pause) Maybe it\u2019s the case, it\u2019s probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">true that, I know for me, I\u2019ll speak for myself, that setting some sort of goal is a lot easier than actually trying to determine what\u2019s a sensible goal. You know, it\u2019s like, what does this actually mean that I have to do? (therapist affirms) I think the goals... for so often have either been unrealistic <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A12\">or unstated. Either way, they\u2019re not going to be met! (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, secret goals are very hard to attain. (client affirms) And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: \u201cAre we there yet? Okay?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: They often, you know, having those unrealistic goals, or those unstated goals, they\u2019re often one and the same. The reason you don\u2019t state them is because some parts of you know that that\u2019s not doable.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Or doing it would require compromising so much else. (client affirms) It\u2019s unlikely that you would do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the idea of having a goal... stated or not... is somehow... better than not having a goal. (chuckles) But I\u2019m not sure that it is, because... again, the penalty for not reaching it... is pretty strong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">(pause) (sighs) Oh, I\u2019m not sure I told you this, something else about my dad. (pause) I think it arrived on Friday, after I got home, I think. He sent me a check for $5000, because I had this conversation with him. Did I tell you all of this? No. (therapist denies) (chuckles) I had a conversation with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">him earlier, I think I told you about that, as far as, you know, the state of my mental health, and things I\u2019m working on. You know, he asked me if it\u2019s something that I have to pay for out of pocket. I said, \u201cWell, yeah. When I came back from Europe I could have taken up with someone else, but I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B32\">want to start over and, you know...,\u201d so on and so forth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">So (sighs) he sent me a letter and a check, which really, you know, kind of messed with my resolve to send him my letter (chuckles), you know? And it said, you know, \u201cThis is probably a drop in the bucket compared to what you\u2019ve had to pay over the years for your therapy, but... This is not a gift or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">a loan, it\u2019s what you\u2019d get when I die, as part of the family. So, just, you know, I did the same with Richard (sp) (my older brother who\u2019s unemployed). And so when, at the end, just deduct what you have gotten in advance, and...\u201d And that (sighs)... I got it on Friday, but I didn\u2019t tell him I received <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">it until... Saturday, Sunday. I just didn\u2019t know what to say about it, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What did you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: (pause0 Well, I felt like... (pause) I felt like it was justified, but I don\u2019t think... he knew why it was justified, because of what I hadn\u2019t shared with him yet, you know. All this shit that\u2019s been going on with me could have been dealt with a long time ago... (pause) And... (pause) I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">know, you know? I felt bad, I felt like, \u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t send the letter now, because...\u201d (pause) You know... maybe this was his way of saying that he feels responsible for it, but he didn\u2019t say that. And so, at the top of the letter, I said, you know, I want you to know I appreciate your gift, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B92\">your, you know, the money you sent. I have to say I almost, you know, it made me think twice about sending this letter, but... it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I need to tell you these things.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: There would still be a lot left unsaid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And the fact that it could, the possibility that it could be unsaid, because of the check, you know, is kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s not about the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s not, and you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And the advance is thoughtful and shows that he\u2019s, he, you know, he cares about you as a parent, and wants to do what he can to ease some of your burdens. But that does not show... I think the letter that you sent, you wanted to really be able to express and have him understand how, and why, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">and what the effects were, not just that there is a connection between parent and child.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) So I don\u2019t know. I... I haven\u2019t deposited it yet, but (chuckles)... But it was something that was a development after I, after I saw you last, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">(pause) But I\u2019ve been... I\u2019ve been toying with the idea of calling him. (pause) But I don\u2019t think I should. (pause) I think it would be unfair to him.

And so... it\u2019s not my job...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Trust that he\u2019ll read the whole thing (client affirms), and hear that part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s not, it\u2019s another attempt to control how he, you know, reacts to this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an attempt to protect him.

So I haven\u2019t, and I\u2019m... going to wait. (sighs) (pause) So that\u2019s where I am.

(pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: (pause) Have there been any sort of after effects of the earthquake for you, more panic attacks, or increased anxiety, or difficulty sleeping, that type of thing that can sometimes happen? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: No. Um, but you know, I was listening to (chuckles) an interview yesterday. Terry Gross was speaking with this photographer, Tyler somebody. He was a prize-winning photographer from the New York Times, who\u2019s been in a lot of war zones. But he was, his recent award was for his... photography <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">of the Kenyan Mall, where the Somali militants massacred a number of people. He was describing the scene and... how people had to just kind of hide, and pretend they were dead or just... You know, they were talking about the music that plays in the mall, and was still playing during the whole... and never stopped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: It just keeps going. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: It keeps going. This woman, with her two children... singing along to the music for five hours afterward, because... they didn\u2019t want to move, she didn\u2019t know if she was going to be safe. And it\u2019s one of those things that you, you know, you say, \u201cOh, yeah, I suppose that was still playing.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">But it puts you there, and it makes you think about things like... school shootings here, or mall shootings here, that happen sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">It put me back in that room, when... I was not sure what the best plan of action was. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to survive, I didn\u2019t know... how to protect myself. (pause) That earthquake came on so suddenly and... without warning... without even a thought that earthquakes happen in Arizona (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">City, that it could happen... that it kind of catapulted me into this place where... I was afraid. I didn\u2019t think I was going to live. And... (pause) there was no preparation, really, that could have helped me, and... you know, how do you prepare for someone who pulls out a gun in a shopping mall, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E52\">know? You just... it\u2019s, you don\u2019t expect it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">So when I think about the sounds, and where I was, and what I was witnessing, and what I was feeling... it does kind of send a shiver through me. Hearing this guy talk yesterday about this... (pause) and I experiencing the fear with my wife... it seemed to me that, you know, being in a mall and experiencing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">something like that is not out of the question. (pause) I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is... there are points in my life... that I... kind of peek in on... you know I... I want kind of this... grisly... vignette, I can put myself there, because I\u2019m in that bathroom, hearing the building creak, seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E72\">things fall down.

The thing that... it\u2019s almost like pornography, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">know? It\u2019s like... or an accident on the road that you, you have to look. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess I feel like I\u2019m wandering in different directions here with this, but... but that experience... it\u2019s only when I put myself there and remember the sounds. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not happening... without will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.

I did this lab stuff yesterday and I\u2019m like, calling this morning. \u201cAny results back?\u201d \u201cNo, not yet.\u201d So I called when I was waiting...

I think, you know, that\u2019s also a way of processing and taking stock of, \u201cThat was then, that\u2019s how I felt...\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">And also comparing that to being able to come back to the now (client affirms).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">I think what\u2019s important is remembering to, you know, if the tendency is to go back and remember the distressing events, there are also probably enjoyable events, happy times, proud moments that you can also go and pinpoint. (client affirms) Those are part of the map of your life (client affirms).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">When somebody is depressed, you\u2019re more likely to seek out the things that are congruent with how you feel. (client affirms) That creates an imbalance, because those are not the only things (client affirms) that you\u2019ve experienced. You know, we also stop to look at the fact that the trees have all started <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">to blossom (client affirms), and making sure that you take a moment to balance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, you\u2019re right. I (chuckles), it\u2019s interesting as you\u2019re talking, I\u2019m thinking like, \u201cWell, why do I grasp for the negative, the distressing, the painful, vivid...?\u201d Because those are vivid (therapist affirms) they are powerful. I think there has definitely, has been an imbalance because... <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F91\">you know (sighs) whatever, graduating or whatever, pick a spot... Yeah, I guess there is a moment in Europe when I got the e-mail that said, you know, \u201cYou\u2019ve won a award.\u201d I remember that moment. It\u2019s vivid. And... I guess it\u2019s also a matter of collecting those and... accessing them, you know, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F92\">I don\u2019t think I have as many of those, at least at ready access, as I do the disturbing moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve practiced the disturbing ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m great at accessing them! (both chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: And I think it\u2019s also... sometimes it feels easier when you go back, and you remember a particularly positive moment to feel bereft that that\u2019s not now, right? Because, well, great. You probably felt elated the first time you asked a girl out and she said yes. But since you\u2019re not in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF1\">moment (you know, on the phone or in a high school hallway or wherever), it\u2019s hard to give it credit that you felt really good right then. (client affirms) But practicing being able to go back and do that, or the first time you dove under water, and you probably felt really proud; or you hit a home <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF2\">run, or you got a basket. Those brief moments that are very significant, and gave you a really vivid picture and feeling (client affirms) being able to go back, practice feeling that, and then being okay with it. Yeah, all moments pass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause) I think it will be a process... a deliberate process for me, because... as I said in my letter to my dad, I don\u2019t have a lot of memories, good or bad, from... you know, my early years... (pause) And what I have, you know, I\u2019m going to have to... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t have to be from any particular time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: No, but I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve had tons of experience. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: True, but I would like to be able to at least... start remembering some, I mean, any of them, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Do you have pictures?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: Somewhere... yeah. Yeah, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve moved a lot. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m not sure where they are, but they\u2019re somewhere, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: That sometimes really helps to jog memories, being able to see pictures of the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Hmm (sighs)... (pause) So... yeah, to answer your question, no, I\u2019m not having any anxiety over the earthquake, but it does give me pause to be in a very public situation that\u2019s, the public is at danger, and I\u2019m part of it. (pause) Yeah. (pause) Where did you go on vacation? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m going to keep that private.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: All right. But you went some place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">THERAPIST: I did go someplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">THERAPIST: There were no earthquakes that I knew of. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause) The blooms are beautiful. Magnolias are just incredible and... I have noticed them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good excuse for being present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause) It just needs to warm up, you know? So you can... I come back and it\u2019s 50 degrees! Anyway... (pause) Yeah, I\u2019m not sure what else to tie up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re working on and writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">CLIENT: Oh. So... I got this job a month and a half ago, doing this video shoot. I think I may have mentioned it. (therapist affirms) Well, I hadn\u2019t heard anything from like... It\u2019s a New York-based production company, and, you know, I\u2019m offering this kind of a side shot, which I\u2019ve never done before. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201291\">(chuckles) And hoping that there is something there that they can use. I\u2019m also responsible for putting all the memory cards from all the cameras into this hard drive that they gave me. It\u2019s like... they didn\u2019t give me a schedule, a time between shoots to do it. It\u2019s like, 15 minutes and takes like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201292\">25 minutes per card.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561873\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">Anyway, so I hadn\u2019t heard from them in a long time. So I get an e-mail last week, saying, \u201cAre you available for two shoots next week, on the 29th and 2nd?\u201d And... I was stunned, because I was like, this is for... second camera and, you know, on both days. And... \u201cYeah, I\u2019m available!\u201d (pause) (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B1\">Then I got an e-mail on... Monday morning... \u201cHave you done any work (both chuckle) on second camera before? Do you have any, you know, examples of your work?\u201d \u201cWell, the shot I did at that Amherst Business School with you was the first time I\u2019d really done that, and...\u201d Didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cSo that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B2\">was good, right?\u201d (therapist chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">But... and I said them a bunch of links... two videos I\u2019ve done and... nothing I\u2019d really like, write home about, but... and I said at the end, you know, I, \u201cIf you need someone with more experience, I understand.\u201d Didn\u2019t hear anything back. I got an e-mail two days ago, saying, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re all set <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D1\">for next Monday, and next Tuesday, and Friday.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Still hired!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">CLIENT: Still hired, so... that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">THERAPIST: Cool! Don\u2019t sell yourself short.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">CLIENT: Well... I won\u2019t, but... It\u2019s hard to know, I mean, because they didn\u2019t give me any direction at all (therapist affirms), you know. The first one, so it\u2019s hard to know as well... But anyway... So, we\u2019ll see what this leads to. Maybe nothing, maybe something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">THERAPIST: Well, thanks for telling me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">CLIENT: Thanks for your interest.
