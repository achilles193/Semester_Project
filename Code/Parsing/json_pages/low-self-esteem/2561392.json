Come on in. (pause) Hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Good. I actually am doing pretty well this week. I had a pretty good week. I started just getting outside more and kind of trying to exercise a bit more. Which I found has helped me a lot mentally every day. So I have almost been trying to do something every day when I can kind of, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">fit it in or try different ways to fit that in. And I found that mentally that has actually really helped me a lot this week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">My mind feels clearer and I just feel more optimistic, almost because of that, I think. (laughs) And then sort of if I notice that I am headed towards a low I have been trying to be more reflective of that. So yesterday (laughs) I was really, really tired. So I felt myself headed towards a lower, kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">of low energy point and tried to stop any negative thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So if I was, you know, feeling a little negative because I was feeling so low energy, I was trying to think of good things that happened that day or turn it around a little bit. So those are two different things I tried this week. And, I mean, it wasn\u2019t perfect but I felt like they helped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. Is there association between being low energy and thinking negatively?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: There is, actually, for me. Like if I am really tired and just kind of want to sit on my couch. It is almost when I am bored is when the negative thinking actually happens for me I have noticed. Because a lot of times if I don\u2019t have a lot of stuff planned for the weekend and there is kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">periods of down time, that is when I have noticed I kind of get into these downward spirals of like a little bit of the depression and stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And that is actually kind of associated, for me, with being tired or down time for some reason. So, I mean, if I am low energy and really tired that is going to happen. (laughs) But it is just sort of, I think, knowing that that could lead to the negative thoughts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Is it hard for you when you have time that is not structured?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Tell me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I think it has a lot to do with control. Like this morning before I left the house I made a list of things that I wanted to accomplish today when I got home. And I need to be able to, you know, cross everything off the list and feel like I got all of this stuff done. So it is actually really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">hard for me to just sit and be. And if I am reading I am fine. So I actually have tried to start reading more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">But if it something like just sitting and watching TV, something kind of passive, I have a really hard time doing something like that for very long without feeling kind of restless, bored. That often can lead to overeating or eating for, you know, reason out of boredom. And then that kind of also leads <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">(laughs) to the negative thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">So I have a very hard time dealing with unstructured time. Like I always need to give myself something to do, have a task or be busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like, is it a restlessness? Do you feel kind of empty and lonely?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Um. Yeah, I guess more of a restlessness. I am okay with being alone but I have to be doing something, I guess. So I am fine if I am on my own but I guess I only have these kind of restless thoughts. If I am not doing anything it is hard. It is hard to explain but I need to feel in control and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">accomplished. And if I am just not doing anything I feel like, you know, a waste. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">It is a waste of time or I need to be accomplishing something that I can be proud of, to see some kind of product. So, for example, even reading a book you finish the book. There is a product. Or cleaning the house, you can see that the house is clean at the end. Or cooking or doing laundry there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">a product at the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Whereas just sitting or just watching TV there is no end result. There is no product. You can\u2019t see anything from time spent that way. And so I think that is why I sort of start having these, you know, bored and negative thoughts because I don\u2019t think I should just be sitting around. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Have you always been like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I think so. I have tried to think back because I do remember as a kid I did spend a lot of time kind of on my own. But I was always reading a lot. So I think it was probably, you know, I was sort of doing that kind of stuff. I never really, I guess, watched a lot of TV or anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">But I can remember having almost like fits as a kid, of being really, really, really restless. Almost where I would have so much energy that I would just scream and kind of have almost an outburst as a kid. So I think I have always needed to be doing something. Like even in, you know, when I was in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">college I would always structure my time. And it is something about having that control, though, that makes me feel really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">And when I feel like I don\u2019t have the control or my time isn\u2019t structured or I didn\u2019t accomplish everything, that is when I feel bad. Which is why I think filling the time with some of the working out too, I think that is almost like, well, I accomplished that today and that is great and that makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">today even better. And I mean in addition to endorphins and all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I think that is part of it too is feeling like I did another good thing. I accomplished this, I accomplished that. I am in control. Like it is that sort of a feeling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Versus what? Versus being out of control?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, or just useless, I think, more. Like I guess out of control. So out of control to me sort of means not accomplishing anything. It is not, you know, it is a little different. It is not like, you know, total chaos but it means not accomplishing anything or not doing anything with an end result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">So, you know, if I sat around instead of cleaning the house I would view that as very negative when I know that there is something else that I view as needing to get done. So that would sort of be out of control to me. (sigh) Yeah, I mean, if I haven\u2019t I really, anything dirty in the house or not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">Like if I haven\u2019t vacuumed in a few days or something, that I also view as out of control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">I am not totally obsessive but a little bit obsessive. I like to see things as clean because it upsets me if I feel like I haven\u2019t had that end result of cleaning. So if I do laundry and do the dishes or something I feel very satisfied with seeing that end structured result. Whereas, if I, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">see there is a lot of [hair from my jog] (ph) or something, I feel like I need to do that later. I need to put that on my list.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">And I have to make sure that I get that done because if I don\u2019t it is going to continue to bother me. I am not going to feel accomplished until I have done that or kept up with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Does it make you feel more valuable? Is that part of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Probably. I think that is part of it because I think to me, yeah, I need to be able to keep my house clean, keep up the school work, also read extracurricular stuff, do x, y and z. And that makes me feel better as a person. Or I worked out so I am more valuable, I am a better person today because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">I did that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">So it is more like doing all of these things that I consider to make you a good person, I guess. Or I would say almost more successful, maybe, would be a better word instead of valuable. It is like what I view as success. So I view, you know, having a structure where you are able to do it all and get <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">everything done and fit in your work out and cook dinner and clean and read and do. You know, that is success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">And then not doing anything with your time, or not having your house be clean, or procrastinating on your work and not working out. That is failure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: This is not all of it. It is more complicated than this. But it almost seems like kind of a focus that will get you away from what you are feeling. I know that it produces a kind of feeling too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: So that is not quite it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: But it seems like it is kind of a focus on something outside of yourself, outside of what is going on inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, in a way I can see that. I mean, but like you were saying it also produces this good, really positive feeling where it kind of makes me feel more whole, I guess. From being able to do all of these different things. And I also, I self-identify with doing well in school or being a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">reader or walking outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">Like there are different ways that I self-identify. And so I think sort of in doing all these thing, like, \u201cSee like, oh, I am fulfilling my purpose.\u201d So I think I self-identify with being a doer. Whereas, just sitting around or feeling sorry for myself, I don\u2019t want to be that person. So that is what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">creates kind of these negative feelings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">But, I mean, it is hard for me to just be. Like if I am in yoga or something I am kind of restless when you have to sit. (laughs) But then I can get into it and zone out but it take me a while. And I have sort of the restless kind of thinking. (pause) But, I mean, I could see how it would take away <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">a little bit from what I am feeling and not let me process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">But I think I associate so much of how I am feeling with the ability to do or to not do these things that it is hard to separate the two, I think. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Sometimes I ask questions and sometimes I sort of just want to see where your mind goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Which is why I am -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I am not intentionally trying to (cross talking at 00:14:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: But, yeah, sometimes I just like to sort of see what emerges and sort of work with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, that makes sense because I am able to kind of think things through on my own, I think. But, like I said, my mind kind of races. (laughs) So yeah, I pretty much feel like I am thinking or my mind is racing to different places all the time. It is really hard for me to still my mind or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">just be. Which is why doing a passive activity is really hard for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">Or even when I am driving I have to listen to a podcast or listen to talk radio or something. (laughs) I have a really hard time just listening to music and zoning out. I have to have that stimulation all the time. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I started thinking about therapy as a passive activity. Like where you just are and see what happens or what emerges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: It is hard. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It is certainly not structured. I mean there is a structure to this for sure but then within the space there is not a lot of structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: It is hard. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Like I have a really hard time if I am out with other people that aren\u2019t very extroverted. And if there is silence it is really, really, really hard for me because it is hard for me to just sit there. Because the whole time, if I am with the other person, I am thinking, \u201cWhy is so and so being <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">quiet? Are they being quiet because they didn\u2019t like what I just said? Maybe I should say something else.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">And then I just start to kind of blabber on. Which is why it is really hard for me. Like I don\u2019t really have any friends that are really introverted or anything because it is so uncomfortable for me to be in that, a silent space or to just be. It is not, yeah, it is not an easy feeling for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: So this will be an interesting exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yes. Yeah. (pause) Yeah because I think that I know a lot of people use meditation and stuff as a really good mindfulness technique. And I have always been afraid to try it because I don\u2019t know how to take to something like that. And I know that you have to practice. (laughs) But, yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">it is just really, really I think difficult for me to feel happy or any sense of satisfaction if I am not actively thinking or engaging with something. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well you could be actively engaging, just not with other people. You could be actively engaging with you mind, I guess. It is sort of a funny way to put it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. That is true. That is a different way of thinking. Well, I mean, so I feel like (pause) Yeah, that is true. I guess I am always Because I was trying to think when I am reading maybe I am kind of actively engaging with my own mind but there is still some kind of a stimulation there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">I am not alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">But I wonder if that I mean, so I think a little bit of when I was feeling that low, low energy time and tried to reflect on it and get myself out of it, I guess that might be a little bit of me in trying to engage with myself. And try to talk myself out of feeling a low that I know is kind of for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">no good reason. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">Like there wasn\u2019t anything that happened to me to make me feel low. It was just because I was kind of tired and kind of restless. And, you know, I was too tired to do work and I was too tired to do anything. So I think me trying to reflect on, \u201cWhy am I feeling this way? Nothing bad happened. I actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">had pretty good day and I am just tired.\u201d It was a good technique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">But definitely when I was doing that it was something I am not used to doing. And it almost made me wonder too if journaling would be good for me as a way of self-reflection because then I am still kind of doing something. (laughs) But it might help me to pick out more of the positive things that are <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">happening during my day. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">Because that is what So that is what I sort of struggle to do is to rationalize the situation. Because often I will just see the negative and not see the positive and focus on the negative so much that it sort of takes over. So I might have had a great day but then I got stuck in traffic and I got <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">home late and I was tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">And so that was what I was focusing on instead of focusing on the other really good or really positive things that happened in the day. And often there are so many but you have this one negative and you just kind of just drill down on it. So I have wondered if some kind of, almost a self-reflection <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">at the end of the day would be helpful to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">Because other than the weekends that is when I tend to get more negative or be more down, if I got stuck in traffic or something happened. Or I don\u2019t feel like I accomplished everything I should have with that day. I wonder if trying to even meditate or do something reflective at the end of the day <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">would help to turn my thinking when it gets like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">Or even almost make it into some sort of a practice where your thinking doesn\u2019t even drift so negatively anymore because you are so used to reflecting on the good. I don\u2019t know. It is something I have thought about doing but haven\u2019t really done it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Are the evenings the time where you spend with your boyfriend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like we will usually have dinner together or something and that is really good. But a lot of times he also needs a little He is very introverted or more introverted than I am. So he needs time after work, like a period of time, just to wind down and kind of, you know, be alone. Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">he is totally okay with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">And so it is during those period where I am by myself and we are not, you know, having dinner together and talking about the day and stuff like that. It is those periods where I am on my own that sometimes I can have this negative thinking or these lows. Because I just feel really restless. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">And it is the same thing on the weekend. We will do some stuff together but we are not doing activities and things together the whole time. And so it is the periods where, you know, he is kind of doing his own thing and I am doing my own thing where I get into these weird thought patterns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">So it is not really when we are together. It is when I just have down time on my own. And I can\u2019t deal with having a lot of that. (pause) Whereas, I think, you know, he can and actually needs that restorative time. And so, yeah, it is hard for me to just not have different schedules and not (ph) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">I probably do need that restorative time a little bit but it is hard for me to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">Which is why I guess I tried to start reading more and tried to start doing other things where I felt like I was accomplishing something or making these lists for myself, which I tend to do more lately. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: More so than you used to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I would say maybe in the past year, though, I started doing them. Like I didn\u2019t really used to make lists. But I will, you know, make a list of everything that has to be done and I have to cross everything out. And then if I have, like a lot of times if I have down time too I like to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">the time to plan. So I will plan out, you know, I will do meal planning or I will plan out when I am going to do different chores or when I do different work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">Like I have to take the time to make this schedule and these lists for myself and then I feel like, you know, that is accomplished and structured. And I have the list waiting and I am going to do this and this and that. And it is going to be a really great day because here is all the stuff I am going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">to be able to do. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">So I wish that I didn\u2019t have to make them but for some reason (laughs) they make me feel, it is this sense of accomplishment of crossing something off that feels really, really good. And sort of staying ahead of the game even with school stuff and not procrastinating. And a lot of times now I actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">am, on my down time I will do even extra stuff for school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">Like I don\u2019t, you know, I try not to let myself watch TV anymore. And so I will do extra school work or watch some BBC video for school. Or just, you know, I always have to spend my time doing these extra things because I think that it is going to make me sort of ahead of everybody else in the class. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">Like I always have to be the best at everything, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Or else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: (laughs) Or else, I mean So I have tried to think about how I will react if I get a grade that isn\u2019t an \u201cA\u201d on an exam or something. Because I know that I just punish myself really badly for things like that. So I am sure it will maybe happen this semester (laughs) because I am taking really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">hard classes. But I think I just feel like a failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">Like to me a \u201cB\u201d is a failure. Or even an \u201cA minus\u201d is a failure and I am not successful and I am not good at something and I need to work harder. And why didn\u2019t I study more? Or, why didn\u2019t I do this? So there is definitely a lot of punishment (laughs) or just really negative self-thought. So, yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">even with the I didn\u2019t work out today or I didn\u2019t clean, or I didn\u2019t do, you know, whatever it is it is sort of like I am a failure for today because I didn\u2019t do all of those things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">And that is the thing that I am trying to flip around but it is really hard. So actually one of my friends from school got a \u201cB+\u201d on something and she was really upset. And so I tried to think how would I want to think to get myself out of the negative thinking because she was doing, you know, something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">similar to what I would probably do. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">And so I said to her, \u201cWell, you still did really well compared to everyone else.\u201d But then there is that comparison too. And then I said, \u201cYou still got a (inaudible at 00:29:01). Like it is obvious that you understand this and it was a hard exam.\u201d And I think I would want to be able to talk myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">out of negative thinking with saying those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">And I am aware that the day comes that I get something other than an \u201cA\u201d it is going to be really, really, really hard on me because so much of my self-worth is being good and having to almost be perfect. And, yeah, I think it is just it is really hard for me to deal with anything that I consider to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">be, not necessarily a failure, but unsuccessful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">So, for example, I took an organic chemistry exam and knew that the last question that I had had some trouble on it. And so I decided that I failed the exam but I actually got a 94. So it is that one thing that you know you didn\u2019t do right and that is failure, I thought that I failed the whole exam. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">So to me that was failure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">So it is almost changing, I guess, my view of what failure is. Because certainly, you know, getting a \u201cB\u201d is not failure. Not cleaning your house every week or having dirt or something isn\u2019t failure. And not being able to cook dinner one night because you are tired isn\u2019t failure. But sometimes I see <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">it that way and I want to change my opinion of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">So like last night I was too tired to cook dinner but I actually tried to just let it go and say, \u201cIt is okay. I am too tired to do laundry. I am too tired to some of the cleaning I wanted to. And I am really too tired to cook. I had exams, I had all this stuff and it is okay.\u201d But then I found myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD1\">so needing the sense of accomplishment at the end of the day so I folded laundry and cleaned while I am doing other stuff because I needed to have that some sort of sense of accomplishment with what I was doing with my time at home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">So in a way I was, you know, trying not to feel guilty but I still needed to that stuff at the end of the day to try to feel like, \u201cOkay, everything is in order so it is okay that I didn\u2019t cook.\u201d I needed, I really needed to feel that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I have a couple of thoughts that came to my mind. I mean one way of thinking about sort of needing to have order is that there is something that feels not ordered inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: You know, and so it is a way of It is kind of an externalization, to use a kind of clunky word for -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: like of something that is going on inside that can\u2019t be managed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And I was thinking about that and I was thinking also about, you know, people have experiences and those experiences feel very true. They may not quite fit the situation but there is some truth to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: The idea that, you know, there is this feeling you have of being a failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And worrying about being a failure and needing to compensate for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And it gets sort of played out in all these different ways in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: But there is some truth to it inside. There is something maybe deeper about this feeling or fear that is maybe old and maybe has a history to it. And so I was thinking about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Oh, I mean, there definitely could be, there definitely is a history of it, I think. And it absolutely could be from stuff way in the past. Because, I mean, as a kid I was always considered to be smart until in fourth grade there was some exam that we all had to take to be in some special program <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">where you have to leave school. And I didn\u2019t do well on that exam and so then I couldn\u2019t be in that gifted group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">Or in ninth grade the only AP class I didn\u2019t class was science because they thought that I wasn\u2019t good at that. But now I am trying to prove and, you know, and I am interested in the classes I am taking, but I am also trying to prove I am good at science. You, like ninth grade teacher told me I wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">but actually I really am. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">And so there is a lot of stuff where because, you know, kids made fun of me because of my weight and the way I looked or my glasses and all this different stuff, school was like it. But I wasn\u2019t even good enough at that. So there is that way of, okay, well, my looks aren\u2019t good enough or my weight isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E31\">good enough. School or intellect is all that I have and if I am not good at that then what am I?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">So I think, I mean, all of that stuff definitely goes way back because, you know, I would react to not getting a certain award or not being chosen for something very negatively. Because a lot of the praise that I got from my parents was in those areas. Like excelling with music or school because I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">not, I wasn\u2019t very good at sports or anything. So that was kind of it and those were the areas that I needed to be good at and I needed that praise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">But somehow I always kept trying and I wasn\u2019t good enough with that. And so then I can remember that also kind of going the other way and saying, \u201cWell, I am not going to be good at school so I am going to try to be popular.\u201d So I can remember as a freshman in high school I kind of stopped talking because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">I thought, \u201cWell, I am being really out there and outgoing and I am saying the wrong thing. And that is not leading me to be popular because I am always saying the wrong thing. And so maybe if I don\u2019t talk then I can be popular because certainly I am not good enough at school to just have that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">I need to have, you know, this other stuff too. So, I mean, there was always a lot of self-identification with, I have to have something, be the best at something and I am not the best at anything. And I don\u2019t know what to do because I have to pick something. I have to pick who I am going to be or what <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">I am going to be good at because I need people to recognize me as this one thing or fit into this one box because I need them to be praising me for that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">So a lot of times now people will say to me, you know, \u201cYou do it all. I don\u2019t know how you do it all. You are always helping other people. You are always doing that.\u201d And that almost fuels it more when people So now people are giving you praise for it so then you say, \u201cWell, that is who I am. I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">to be really, really good at it.\u201d So, I mean, I think that is where a lot of it comes from. Like it definitely goes way back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I am sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: No I am just saying, I mean, I just always needed to self-identify as something and whatever it is I have to be really good at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Well it made me think about when you use the word \u201crecognize.\u201d I started thinking about, you know, how we have begun to sort of talk about your relationship with your Mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: And how there was a failure of recognition. That what she saw you as is just an extension of her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: And not recognizing you in your own right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: And so here you are trying to create an identify for yourself that is uniquely yours but that has some drawbacks to it in terms of the toll it takes on you. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: But it is sort of a way of creating an identity. And in lieu of not having sort of that kind of recognition maybe of you as sort of your own person.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: That makes sense. Because I mean, so I always think I have tried to strive to figure out who I am and what I actually enjoy and, you know. And so actually, I mean, for me the first sort of, or what I thought was the first sort of accomplishment in terms of going back to maybe something I enjoyed <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">or who I was, was overcoming the fear of studying science.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">Because I was actually really, it took me a while to decide to make a career change because I knew I had to take science classes and I had been told I was bad at science. And so for me almost going back to who I was as a kid before I was told that I was bad at it was a sense of accomplishment because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">it was <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">I think what I have been trying to do is figure out how much of who I am today is because of societal pressures or society telling me who I should be and me trying to go with it. And how much of it is what I actually enjoy and what I love and what I thrive doing. And so a lot of my initial (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201071\">at 00:39:27) I think, were because of things that society, in a way, had told me I was good at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">Like people had always told me I was very good with, you know, with history and you are good with helping other people. And so I studied political science and international peace studies because people told me that was what I was good at. But it wasn\u2019t actually what I really, truly enjoyed. Do you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201091\">what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">It was more like I was doing it and fulfilled in a way because other people told me that that was the role that I should take. And so what I am constantly trying to do is sort of figure out, what do I actually, truly, truly enjoy? And not just enjoy because I saw someone do it on TV or someone told <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">me that was what, you know, what I should be doing. And it is this constant really difficult struggle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">And I think with the science stuff it is like I really, really do truly, truly enjoy it. And it is not like a fake enjoyment. I mean part of the enjoyment might be from doing well but it is not a fake enjoyment because other people told me that I should do that. It is something that really does spark <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D1\">this intellectual curiosity in that, you know, I can really get lost in that. I actually do enjoy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">And for me that is the first thing that I have been able to reconcile. Because I feel like there have been these external influences for so long that it is really difficult to figure out who I am or what I actually like to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: That makes a lot of sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: I mean what you describe I mean there is a lot of ways in which what you were describing with your Mom would sort of have negative impact on you. And I am sure there is a lot good in your relationship too, so I appreciate that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: No relationship is all bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: Right. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: But one of the problems in what you described is not really, A, not feeling someone is curious about who you are and then also just this confusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: Are you just, you know, to what extent are you being You know, is an image being, or a set of who you are is being imposed on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: And to what extent is it really a reflection of who you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20124-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20124-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: And it is confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean and a big example of that too would be religion because that has been very confusing for me. Because my Mom made me teach religion classes to kids and do all this stuff at church and just imposed this whole thing on me that I just followed because that is what I was told to do. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B1\">And I have been, part of me feels like this guilt about not wanting to be Catholic or follow the same religion as her, and part of me feels this total confusion over the whole issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">And when I go home I still go to church with her because I don\u2019t want to upset her. And, you know, I think that is just one. There is a lot of different areas but that is just one area where it is really, really evident because I have been so confused about, well, I know that I don\u2019t really believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D1\">in all the same stuff as her. But I don\u2019t even know what I believe in because you have been so indoctrinated with something or told this is what you should do or guilted into it, that it is really hard to come out with your own feelings or your own set of beliefs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">And there is a lot of, you know, exploration and stuff. But it is really difficult when someone told you for like 21 or 22 years, really like, \u201cThis is what you have to do and there is no other option and this who you need to be,\u201d it is really hard to reflect back on those years and reflect on what <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F1\">is going on now and try to identify what is true about what you believe or who you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: I can totally see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah, so. I mean that is one area where I have really been able to identify what is going on and I still feel really confused. But I can see what has been going on. But I think that subconsciously it has happened in every area of my life, really. And it is really hard to figure out what <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201331\">you want or who you are or what you enjoy and believe when there have been so many years, and really formative years that were spent just being told, you know, \u201cYou are this and you should do this and you are good at this.\u201d (pause) Yeah. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">And I think a lot of, that is where a lot of my guilt comes in because breaking the mold or doing something different. Like when I decided to change careers and go back to school there was so much guilt. And it was really hard to deal with. Like there was so much negativity from my family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">And now And I actually had talked to them about it. And I said, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate this. This is what I have decided to do and here is why I am going to do it. And I don\u2019t appreciate you being so negative because it is not going to change anything.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: Why were they negative about your career change?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: Because I was leaving a job where I was making a lot of money but I was really unhappy. And they felt that that was a bad decision because I was going into a field where I wouldn\u2019t make a lot of money and going to be spending a few years not making any money. And so they thought that was a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B1\">bad decision. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: And so what I tried to stress was, for me, being happy and fulfilled means so much more. And I just need to do this now and it is really important to me. And it took a long time for me to get them on board. And there was other people that were really negative towards me about it too. Like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F1\">president of the college I went to said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just become a pharmacist. They make more money. Why are you?\u201d And he is a priest. (inaudible at 00:46:54) (laughs) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2013E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561392\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20141\">So there is so much judgment and so much negativity. And that was really hard to overcome. And so it is like as you continue to make all these changes there is always going to be that judgment and negativity. I mean especially from my family but from everywhere really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20143\">THERAPIST: We are going to need to stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20145\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20147\">THERAPIST: But let\u2019s pick this up next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20149\">CLIENT: Okay. Definitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Did my assistant, I want to make sure, did she send you anything? Statements or anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">CLIENT: No. That is what I was going to ask you because I think there is a form I need to fill out for Blue Cross.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Right. So you should, what you will get from her is just sort of a co-pay statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So usually at the end of the month people pay me. You know, like we just do monthly invoices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">THERAPIST: So you will get a co-pay statement and exactly, she will give you a statement to submit to your insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">THERAPIST: And I think it is on their website there is a form to fill out. You have to fill out very little of it. Almost all of it is on the statement. Like you just have to fill out I think your member ID and your name and your address.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">CLIENT: Oh. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">THERAPIST: And then everything, you just attach to the statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">CLIENT: Just attach everything and send it in to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20163\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20165\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20167\">THERAPIST: Okay. Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20169\">CLIENT: That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Okay. Great. So I will see you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D\">CLIENT: Thank you. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20171\">CLIENT: You too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20173\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
