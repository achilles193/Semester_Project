I don't know what that means. But like in terms of doing things for my future or actually thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">about taking the MCAT or even looking at other programs just kind of helps waiting it out. And kind of keep doing what I'm doing. I don't know. But I wish I don't know that I I don't know. [0:07:00] I guess just to have the motivation or being inspired, I guess. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">And I feel like it's kind of the idea of like at work being bored or just doing the I don't know the same things in work over and over again.

I wouldn't expect doing the same thing. And I don't know. Just online reading things I don't know just that over and over again thing. Nothing really inspiring, I guess. (pause) [0:11:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">I guess there's I don't know. For some reason I feel like it's kind of stupid to keep talking about it because it's like me being I don't know a bit lazy or just kind of I don't know. I don't even know. I guess just kind of like being lazy and not really wanting to put much effort into things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">or like into I don't know.

I couldn't take on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">a literature class. They're going to read two books a week. You can't do that with science and softball. But that was my decision (inaudible at 0:24:28). But I mean, like but even now like why don't I do those things now? Like I don't need to be in college to study them (inaudible at 0:24:43).

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you blew it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yea, I guess. [0:29:01] (pause for one minute)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: So even if everything you said was true. And I'm I will be frank and I'm skeptical about some of it. But even if you were a whiner and lazy and you blew your chances to I don't know I guess, at a good education or like take advantage of the opportunities you had in a way and learned <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">the skills that you needed to. And I mean, even if all that let's say for a moment that all that is exactly true. [0:30:58] It all still sounds you still haven't seemed quite focused on like fairly critical like the kind of (inaudible at 0:31:11) kind of (inaudible at 0:31:16) critical things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F2\">about yourself. (pause) I mean, you seem sort of quite drawn to talk about these (inaudible at 0:31:41) character or your decisions that in a pretty critical in a very critical way. [0:32:02] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: So I don't really understand, I guess. Are you saying that like because I'm so critical even though I think I blew it? Or...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098718\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: No. I'm saying the vein in which you're talking about yourself seems really terribly critical. Even if which I don't necessarily agree with or believe but I'm just going with what you've said. You know all those things are true. For example, you're not saying, \"Yea, I made bad decisions <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">about the classes that I took. And I wish I could have sat back and thought about it more or followed so and so's example or dropped softball so I had more time.\" [0:33:17] Or and there's no, \"Well, I didn't want to do those things that I was doing.\" Or, \"Softball is important,\" or, \"I like being <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">part of the team.\" Or, \"I felt all this pressure from my mom or my coach or whomever else.\" Like it's a very sort of constricted story that you're telling about it and one that's like very focused on pretty much the \"I am a loser\" aspect of it, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Well, I guess in the end I'm the one who made every decision. I mean, I decided to go back to softball. [0:34:00] I just I had those classes. I mean, I'm not just like saying I'm limited in like what influenced me because I don't know. But yea, I think in the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:34:22) I know you're right. Like nobody signed you up for the softball team or registered you for classes you over your protest or anything like that. You're right. I don't have anything wrong with that. As I think about it, I think you're berating yourself, though. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">I think the what you're actually doing as you are talking about what happened is berating yourself over it. And when you say, \"I didn't take different classes or a wider variety of subjects,\" or something like that. [0:35:05] I don't think sort of the point there is to wonder about it to like what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">made you do it that way or to feel sad about not taking other classes. Or to examine what you could do about it now. I think sort of the activity you're like the sort of point in your talking about it I'm pretty sure it's to berate yourself over it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: I mean, yea. A little. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry. I'm interrupting you again. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: No, that's OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I don't think this is something you're consciously intending to do. [0:36:00] Like I don't think, \"No, I'm going to see Ethan today. Sit down and just berate myself.\" But I think that seems to be what's emerging as you talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: I mean, I feel I just have a lot of as a said regrets. And yea. And like I feel like with the another I don't know I guess it's not easy way, though. And like I tried to make it so school wasn't like so overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Sorry. Are you sort of quite saying as implicitly but the impression I gather is you're very angry with yourself for these decisions that you've made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: I guess I'm angry that I was intimidated. Or allowed other people to (inaudible at 0:37:06) me in what I should take or what classes I should take. Or even like I was neuroscience but I didn't like I don't know I mean, really think what I should do with this. Or I don't know. I should talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">to more people. Talk to more professors. I was just intimidated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: That's what you're...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: That's what I'm angry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Or angry at yourself for...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: ...like being intimidated by the prospect of talking to professors or other students? Or kind of taking the risk to branch out?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098718\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Right. Or just kind of I don't know. It's weird like it's like I didn't want focus on that when it was there. [0:38:04] Kind of the only way I can think of it is like I don't know. For some reason I don't know you don't want to pay like yourself on the bill or something. You just keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">ignoring it. Something like that. Like that's how I think I felt about doing things to kind of initiate to find out what I wanted to do. And talk to people who could help me or that kind of yea. I think that way I've kind of just kind of like let people direct me and then again just like I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I see. I think I'm getting a clear picture. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: I mean, I just kind of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yea, this kind of like passive, avoidant...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: ...way of dealing with it. [0:39:00] Like there were all these opportunities of these things that you could have done the decisions that you could have made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And you just kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Right. Kind of I don't know like yea, I guess slightly ignore them or just like didn't even want to like deal with it. I don't know. Like avoiding looking in the mirrors and like that kind of doing that to those opportunities. And then I guess yea, that's not what I'm angry at today. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">was intimidated or I don't know. I have been (inaudible at 0:39:42).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: It's like if you could you go back, you'd say like, \"OK, I should go talk to this professor. All right. That's what's been freaking me out. But I should either go talk to somebody about it or figure out how I can deal with it or just go do it or something. But burying my head in the sand <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">and always thinking about how much I want to talk to him. Just not doing it is not the way to go.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And you're really angry and critical of yourself for doing it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yea. And I mean and yea. And I don't even know why that I was so I don't know against I don't know what the word turning away from like those opportunities and I don't know why. So like you get e-mails about stuff and I'm just like (inaudible at 0:40:57). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: What makes it so bad to have done that? I mean, I'm not arguing and saying well, that's a great thing you missed these opportunities. But... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: I don't know. I think I I don't know missed opportunities to find out what I really want in work. And here it's like work and neuroscience and not work in endocrinology or something like that. Like kind of I don't know make the best of what my education has been or just and then also <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">just like know more about the process applying to grad school or applying to med school. [0:42:06] But I don't know. Because I feel like I was yea, I had no idea about it. And so for some reason I just started to decided to plan and most of my information came from Vicki (ph) because she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD2\">went to these things. And I don't know. Maybe yea, just hear about jobs or opportunities in recent e-mails and stuff like that. I don't know. Or (pause) [0:43:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: And the only way I could describe in I think it's like a kind of a weird characteristic of mine is like I don't know so you get like coupons but you don't use them. Or I don't know. Or even somehow search for a way to pay less. I wouldn't do that. I would just kind of like whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098718\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Just want to get it over with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Right.
