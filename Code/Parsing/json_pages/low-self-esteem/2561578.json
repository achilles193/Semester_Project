Well, so yeah, a lot going on. Um\u2026 Yeah, definitely like a situational depression thing maybe a little bit. I don\u2019t know, but just been like a bit of a rollercoaster last several days. Even like within the same day, like sometimes, yeah, I\u2019m having\u2026 So\u2026 Oh that\u2019s right, yeah, yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">Yeah, Thanksgiving was okay. I mean, you know, I was glad that we did it at my cousins for the reasons I said. So I didn\u2019t hear one political discussion the whole night, you know. But yeah. You know, our family\u2019s just gotten depressing, you know, like they are no men kind of, you know. [Ulysses is] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">a shell of his former self, he has nothing to talk about really except his stuff. It\u2019s just yeah, I don\u2019t know, it was okay. But there was something\u2014something felt a little, I don\u2019t want to say pathetic, but something just felt kind of very blah. It was fun hanging out with my little cousins or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">But Friday was really nice, I hung out with George, we went to see Peter Wolf. That was nice, you know, it was a fun night. [2:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But yeah, I don\u2019t know, just in general I\u2019m just kind of\u2014every day is like a\u2014I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go anymore kind of, you know, just because I\u2019m so\u2014there\u2019s just so much going on. I think\u2014yesterday and the day before I really had moments where I really felt like dark, depressed kind of. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">I realize part of it is because, you know, I\u2019ve just\u2014I realize in those moments more than I have before that\u2014you know, how fucked up these old things are in me, like my mom\u2019s voice. So I think now that I\u2019m so much better in so many ways when I have those moments for some reason I get even\u2014it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">a really bad momentary\u2014because I just feel like, wow, I must hate myself so much, right, I must have so much\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t hate myself, but those triggers are there. You know what I mean? I can\u2019t\u2014like I just get so bad, I get so like\u2014 The other night I\u2014well, there were also some other like real things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">that happened, but those were really just\u2026 like I was even down\u2014I couldn\u2019t even step back to see how well I handled\u2014you know what I mean? Like that\u2019s even happening now. I\u2019m handling things so well, but I have trouble seeing that. You know what I mean? And that\u2019s depressing. [laughs] You know what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">saying? That I don\u2019t find comfort sometimes in that, or I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m explaining it well but\u2026 [4:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: No, it does sound like the way just really described the last [inaudible]. You\u2019re really getting into a place where you\u2019re making [inaudible] sort of very deep, very dark feelings about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: And sometimes being able to know that your [unclear] feelings\u2014or sometimes it can take over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I can imagine you really will have to find your out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Because I think what it is, is I think\u2014I mean, a lot of people experience that. I just think that what it is, is that if you\u2019re an artist and you\u2019re ambitious and serious about more than one art form\u2014I mean, in other words I already have so much on my plate that could cause all kinds <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">of melancholy and frustration. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561578\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: So then when you couple it with all this old stuff it\u2019s hard. That, plus just feeling lonely. Like I\u2019m having moments where I just feel really like lonely and frustrated. And then it becomes like a viscous cycle. You know, then I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s just not going to happen. I\u2019m not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">to find\u2014blah, blah, blah.\u201d I want to find someone Assyrian, but how the fuck\u2019s that going to happen. I want to go to Assyria but I don\u2019t have the money to do that right now. So time is just going by. You know what I mean? It just becomes like a\u2026 [6:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">The two things that happened though, I had a date Saturday night that I was really looking forward to. Like this girl was kind of giving me butterflies a little bit, which that doesn\u2019t happen often anymore at all. So we have a great time, we go, we hang out, she has a drink, whatever, fine, okay. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">hang out, we have a great time, I\u2019m totally into it. At the end of the night I walk her kind of half-way home, and we make out, whatever, whatever. The next day or the day after that I get an e-mail saying that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with drinking and driving, and for that reason it\u2019s just going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">to work, we can\u2019t hang out together. And I was just like so\u2014it got me on so many levels. First of all, that sounds like bullshit to me. Just don\u2019t say anything. Like if you\u2019re just not into it or something just don\u2019t saying anything, just be a guy about it, don\u2019t\u2014I\u2019d prefer that. Don\u2019t give me some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">weird\u2014I don\u2019t like the whole, \u201cYou\u2019re great, you\u2019re so awesome.\u201d Well, obviously I\u2019m not that great and that awesome, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">But second of all I was like drinking, and what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, it just\u2014I mean, that\u2019s already obviously a sore spot with me. So I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d So I wrote back to her, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t\u2014who\u2019s drinking and driving? I walked you half-way home and then I went\u2014what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">do you mean drinking and driving?\u201d And I had like two, two and a half beers. But I said, \u201cOn top of all that I told you that I was totally fine. If you don\u2019t drink\u2014like I asked you, like I\u2019m totally flexible. We can just have tea.\u201d You know, like she just told me that you\u2019re that uncom\u2014 And also, why <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">did we have such a great time and why did we make out? Like what the fuck are you talking about? [8:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">But then what really got me was part of the conversation that night was she had this whole thing about when we talk about relationships. I never even heard this term, \u201cgas lighting\u201d? I didn\u2019t even know what that was. But she was talking about it, and I was like, \u201cOh my god, that\u2019s\u2014I didn\u2019t know that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">there was a word for that, but that\u2019s happened to me like twice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: What is it again? I\u2019ve heard the word but I kind of [overtalk].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Gas light\u2014like what Samantha did to me is gas lighting. Where I make you feel like you\u2019re crazy and irrational, and you\u2019re the one being weird, you know. So she gives me this whole thing about that, and then she sends me this\u2014I was like, \u201cDude, that\u2019s the ultimate\u2014you\u2019re doing the thing that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">you say you don\u2019t like. It doesn\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t make any fucking sense.\u201d So I was just\u2014like that didn\u2019t help. You know, I was like, of course, the one girl\u2014I kind of got all\u2014you know, like that just\u2014that wasn\u2019t good, because then that put me in a bad\u2014you know, I was like, see, there is something. The girls <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">I really want, there\u2019s something about me, they don\u2019t want me. Like there\u2019s something\u2014you know, like that was bad.

But one time she let\u2014on our second date she let it slip that she\u2019d been on another, okay, stupid date. And I kind of told her, I was like, you know, I\u2019m a very don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">ask, don\u2019t tell guy. There\u2019s no reason\u2014like how am I supposed to be\u2014what\u2019s that supposed to do for me? Like we\u2019re on a date, so I don\u2019t really want to know. But anyway. But then she e-mailed me Sunday and she was like\u2014she sent me this long e-mail saying, you know, \u201cThis online dating thing is blah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">blah, blah, it\u2019s kind of crazy, I just, blah, blah, blah.\u201d And then she\u2019s like, you know, basically I slept with someone last night. And she\u2019s like, \u201cI just feel really bad. I know that you have this like don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell thing, but I just feel like I have to tell you.\u201d And she was like, \u201cI\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200333\">totally understand if you don\u2019t want to see me or whatever.\u201d Oh, we had plans that night, that\u2019s what it was. She\u2019s like, you know, \u201cI\u2019d still really like to see you,\u201d but she\u2019s like, \u201cIt just happened, I totally didn\u2019t blah, blah, blah,\u201d all this stuff, whatever. [10:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s odd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: You know what, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not. And I wrote back such a great response to her, I wish I could read it to you, but\u2014because it got me thinking about this whole date\u2014in a way my response to her encapsulated\u2014it forced me to crystallize what I think about dating. And I just told her, I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure how to respond. I mean, this is the problem with online dating. It\u2019s the problem with dating in general,\u201d I told her. It was like, \u201cWe all say we want a certain thing, but everything we do, and the ways we try to get those things, are totally antithetical to that.\u201d And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">like, you know, \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t like going\u2014\u201d I mean, yes, I\u2019m on there too, but it\u2019s why\u2014but I hate being on there, and I\u2019m super, super picky about who I actually meet. It\u2019s like we\u2019re just flipping\u2014it\u2019s like shopping. I mean, we all pretend that we\u2019re reading profile, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re just he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200373\">attractive, he\u2019s not, he\u2019s attractive. You know what I mean? She\u2019s attractive. That\u2019s all it is. And there\u2019s something\u2014that can\u2019t be healthy, it just can\u2019t. Something doesn\u2019t feel healthy. Yes, I know, you could walk into a bar and that\u2019s what you do too.

Yes, of course there\u2019s a profile, but you don\u2019t really pay any attention to that profile until you\u2019ve already decided someone\u2019s really attractive to you.

See, this is like\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014I was like\u2014 I\u2019m working hard to not be\u2014I\u2019ve worked hard to not be more cynical\u2014as cynical and jaded. Not jaded, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">but just to try to trust people more. You know, but just\u2014you know, things like that don\u2019t help.

That\u2019s what I was telling, I was like I feel like with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">dating you can\u2019t win anymore. It\u2019s either going to be the love of your life who you marry\u2014I mean, either you\u2019re going to get married to this person, or I just feel like there\u2019s a lot of\u2014we\u2019re just all so fucked up.

I mean, it was at least honest, you know. But the night before, that just felt Samantha-esque. That\u2019s what depressed me, you know.

Sure, if someone\u2019s like chronically complaining without anything moving in it, or feeling\u2014when you felt, I think it was your mother, like you got shut out. That\u2019s one thing. To me it feels more like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">when I get to hear like a whiff of what actually is personal to you, it feels more like just getting to know you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t feel like complaining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: It feels like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s his experience,\u201d rather than society\u2019s experience.

You know, I\u2019ll listen, but I\u2019ll like shut\u2014inside I\u2019ll be kind of shut down after a certain point, I\u2019m like all right, yes. Again, wrap it up, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D1\">And that\u2019s not good either, you know.

One of the reasons I think you shut down when someone\u2019s talking is that, for one it could simply be [treating all the stuff in?] your mother, but in particular, if what happened with your mother is her complaining, her venting, her <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">smothering, at the cost of seeing you at all, like you disappeared, then when you\u2019re with someone who is venting, complaining, whatever, bitching about a day, I think that old child part that just wants to actually be seen, and validated, and exist in the relationship can feel really smothered by this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F2\">other person taking up a lot of space.

[laughs] And I know I\u2019ve gotten so much better. I have to remind myself of that. But\u2026 It\u2019s just very frustrating. [pause] And then, with all this though, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201392\">yesterday I started recording an EP. And it\u2019s like\u2014last night I was thinking like, \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d See this\u2014I can\u2019t take it. Like I just had just wrote this song over the weekend, okay. I didn\u2019t have lyrics yet. I went to the coffee shop yesterday, I wrote some of the best lyrics I\u2019ve ever written, I think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201393\">in like a one-hour period. Showed up at this space, we recorded a rough version that sounds fucking amazing. These guys had never heard this song before. And yet I can\u2019t\u2014you know what I mean? And yet all this is happening. You know what I\u2019m saying? Like that\u2019s just\u2014I\u2019m losing patience with myself, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201394\">know.

And they remain there. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201831\">never actually get to participate. Stay there. And like really look at them. You know, like the analogy of being in the storm, and then the stormy waters, then you calm down, and then you actually get to beneath the surface and what\u2019s going to be down there, and what happens if you\u2019re just swimming <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201832\">around in whatever it is you find. I think that\u2019s a part of what makes it feel like you keep finding it and there\u2019s still more, is that of course this, because it got packaged up so quickly and put away because it was so scary.
