Happy belated birthday, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Yep. Friday [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:27) and Vicki and her brother was looking at schools in Philadelphia and he had never been to Philadelphia before, so we went with him. I went back to Delaware with Vicki just for Saturday, just to hang out.  It was nice out, so we just went for a hike. Other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">than that, there is not much going on. I\u2019m starting to think about options for what I want to do for grad school. It looks like UNC is my best option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Did you get in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I got an offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yesterday I was thinking about that \u2013 moving and if I should save money and live with my parents, but that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s the best thing; and then finding a place to live. I have to think about it a little longer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s big news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I guess one of Vicki\u2019s friends from school is going there for residency, so she\u2019ll be there pretty much the time that I\u2019ll be there; so that\u2019s nice. We\u2019ll both be on [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:30) campus. (pause) I also kind of see it as more of a hassle with having to move. [It brings all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">things out.] (ph?) It\u2019s hard for me to get excited about it and not immediately go to what am I going to do about moving? Stuff like that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So it hits you pretty quickly and then you start to think about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) Everyone seems to have an opinion about it in terms of \u201cyou should take time off\u201d or \u201cyou should go somewhere\u201d or \u201cyou should live with your parents\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t live there.\u201d We\u2019ll see. (pause)  I don\u2019t know. I think I just kind of want things to stay the same because I feel I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">better control myself and do the things I want to do and not be lazy, not be stressed out. With the kind of routine I have now, I know things that make me feel better.  Even this weekend, it\u2019s hard for me to relax and not be anxious about what\u2019s next or my energy levels. (long pause)  I guess I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">knew what I wanted and was wanting to be more flexible and not so anxious about everything, kind of a feeling of not wanting to do anything. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m thinking about it, but I\u2019m not sure yet what to say. (pause) I guess part of what seems like it\u2019s frustrating is how, in a way, this is what you wanted; and yet it\u2019s also making you feel anxious and stressed.  (pause) It seems like you\u2019d rather be able to think about it a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">bit or get excited that you\u2019ve gotten a good offer and have a little breathing room from all the decisions that then come next.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: The feeling is like I\u2019m doing this alone, so I want to do whatever is easiest in terms of finding a place. I\u2019m not excited about it because it\u2019s just like whatever.  It\u2019s kind of like me; I just want what\u2019s easy, that I don\u2019t have to sit and stress about or feel anxious or worry about. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: This isn\u2019t about feeling good, it\u2019s more about not wanting to be super stressed out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right \u2013 or just not excited about it.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s more like wanting to deal with all the things that it raises that are stressful, like basically these big to-dos that add to your to-do list; and also the opinions everybody has about decisions you should make.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562228\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being whiny, but I can just leave easily. I don\u2019t have to do this and that and that \u2013 train someone and other things that would be so much work.  I feel like I just want to be working on myself and concentrating on that. Any little change throws me off. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">if I\u2019m being stubborn or inflexible. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I guess, apparently, at least my part in this, when you say that you\u2019re being stubborn and should be more flexible, I guess in a way, that reflects a burden that feels like I\u2019m sort of putting on you \u2013 you probably, as well \u2013 but I guess I imagine mostly from you and a little bit from me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">in your mind, not only do you have stressful things to deal with, but really you should be more flexible and you should be dealing with this in the right way. Do you see what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right.  (pause) It\u2019s hard for me to enjoy things if I\u2019m just anxious or out of my comfort zone. I wish I could just relax. (pause)  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just always so focused on the negative or whatever. I don\u2019t know. (long pause) [I think this because I\u2019m not enjoying myself at all and don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">feel good.] (ph?) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I clearly did have the wrong idea when I mentioned something about that a couple of minutes ago. It does sound like this is causing you a lot of stress and anxiety. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I just wish I wanted to deal with it or was excited about it and that it trumped the normal anxiety about everything.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Instead, is it a little bit the opposite? I guess I\u2019m thinking, that said, at least when you\u2019re here you kind of know the things that you can do that will help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Whereas there are just so many unknowns with going to grad school. It\u2019s the unknowns that make it harder to deal with, the stressful things about the decisions and figuring out what to do? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right. All these worries about whether I\u2019m doing it right or getting the most out of something. I don\u2019t know. (long pause)  I guess I don\u2019t want to fall further into regret or keep doing the same things that make me hate myself. I just want time to get better, time to actually change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I would imagine you are probably referring to losing this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I just want to not be consumed and to change [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:55). (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess it sounds like you\u2019re worried that the things we\u2019re working on will get lost or overridden; kind of drowned out by . . . I guess I can\u2019t tell. (long pause)  Are you saying partly you\u2019re worrying you\u2019ll regret leaving the work that we\u2019re doing and feel very caught up in the kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">stuff that, after you leave, you\u2019re often caught up in there that we talk about at work and stuff and you\u2019ll have less hope of feeling better? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: A little bit. It was more because I don\u2019t feel better. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in a good state or change or that I\u2019m just going to go and do all these things or be so worried about the wrong things and not take advantage of what I need to do.  I\u2019ll be so worried about being socially [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">at 00:32:11) instead of networking and taking advantage of opportunities or something like that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562228\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s like what you describe from college somewhat? (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess I just kind of want change or want to feel better. I want to feel capable. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I think also safer. (pause)  I think a lot of this is terribly frightening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I\u2019m just not sure what to do because the more I do things, the more I try, they kind of weigh me down or make me feel worse. (long pause)  I guess it just feels like I\u2019m going to have to keep pushing myself, just doing it. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I have the feeling that at other times I don\u2019t think you want advice or for me to tell you what to do. I think you want me to somehow protect you from all the worry and, I think, isolation that go along with the specter and starting grad school; and I guess probably by helping to reassure <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">you a little bit about the ways you feel you\u2019re going about this so badly or that you will make a bunch of crucial mistakes where you\u2019re not handling things well.  Things can feel so bad and overwhelming, I think, that it\u2019s helpful if I sort of reassure you in a way about those things. I don\u2019t mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">to make them go away or that you don\u2019t have them the next time, but in the moment, I think it assuages things a little bit. I think it makes you feel a little bit protected, but it does sound like you are in a period of being really pretty distressed about all this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m just focused on wanting to change or wanting things to be different or feel better. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Are you, in essence, also seeing your time here as also being kind of a failure? Maybe a bit on me, but I would guess that you probably see it more on you because you don\u2019t feel better? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Right \u2013 or I can\u2019t control or let go of things. I\u2019m just always consumed by or affected by things and the outcome is always negative instead of positive how it affects me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I see. So in a way, the two big efforts that you\u2019re talking about and, in a way, are making you feel worse are, I assume, in a way that assumes to both applying to grad school and getting in and deciding to do this.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I guess I feel like I\u2019m just doing it wrong and am not excited or am not seeing it the way I\u2019m supposed to. I\u2019m preoccupied with the wrong thing or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
