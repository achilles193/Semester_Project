I actually think, from a logistical standpoint, it won\u2019t be a problem, because it probably will coordinate with your time in Nepal, if you go. But I\u2019m actually going to be on maternity leave...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: ...for about six weeks over the summer. (client affirms) It will be about the third week in June, and I plan on coming back like, early to mid-August, at least like, two days a week.

I know you\u2019re usually in Nepal during much of that time, anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll go this summer (therapist affirms), but you never know. (chuckles) Yeah. I might go in the winter or something. But yeah, I don\u2019t think that would be a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I plan to be out of the office for five or six weeks, and then come back about like, you know, two days or something, and then come all the way back.

I\u2019ll obviously leave then, and then be out, essentially for July, and then be back at some point in August.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Okay.

What, I\u2019m sorry. Which part of it is odd?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: No, just, you know, like... yeah. No, it\u2019s not odd, I guess. (chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Odd that now it\u2019s your turn?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I\u2019m just, I just, you know, talk about myself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Do you have questions for me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: About what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You said, you know, it\u2019s because, well, I\u2019ve told you something about myself (chuckles), you know. Did you have questions about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: No, I mean, I don\u2019t really, you know, know you, so (chuckles)... I don\u2019t guess, I wouldn\u2019t know what to ask, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">(pause 00:04:30 to 00:05:04)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">I had kind of a... an interesting weekend. Nelson (ph) and I had a fight, and like, I was like, so close to breaking up with him, but then, you know like, somehow that didn\u2019t happen, so it was like... I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">(pause) I think... how did it... start... (pause) I guess like... I came to know that he was going to have dinner with his ex-girlfriend. I think be , I told you about that on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: You had said that you had read his text and you knew that there was some communication then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, so they were having dinner and I was hanging out with my friends and then like, afterwards like, he came to pick me up and stuff. I was, I guess, feeling a little weird (chuckles), you know. And then, I guess, on Friday... like... later that night, I don\u2019t know like... like, I cooked him <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">dinner and then he was tired, so he fell asleep and then, when he was sleeping, I read more of his texts. Then I was just like, \u201cOkay, they\u2019re like flirting!\u201d You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">I felt weird. It was like, 1:00 a.m. in the morning and I was like, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even walk home right now,\u201d you know? Then I was thinking I\u2019m missing Chris, and you know, because he would never do this, or just like, wondering like... what I had with Chris was you know like, was it pure like, was it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">like, more closer to love, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">Then this is, is this a sham? I\u2019m just like... not even being honest with Nelson, and I\u2019m like, maybe using him, and maybe he\u2019s using me, too, or whatever. So just like, you know, weird negative thoughts and (chuckles), so... And then I was just, and then he woke up suddenly or something and like, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">know, we were talking. He was like, \u201cYeah, I was wondering if I should tell my parents that I\u2019m dating someone. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">So, he hasn\u2019t like, yet, told them. And I was just thinking, I didn\u2019t say it (inaudible) like... I don\u2019t know, you know. That will make this more solid, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready for that, you know? Because I feel like I should go back to Chris. (chuckles) I just feel like, you know, that\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">the default state or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">And then... I don\u2019t know how it came like, he was just like, \u201cYeah, I have some like, concerns and like, you... as to what your future plans are, and like, I don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t live... you live from paycheck to paycheck and you know, that\u2019s weird to me. You take all these favors from your friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">and you\u2019re like, maybe someone like me is just supposed to be in debt, and you don\u2019t, you know, you wear shoes with holes in them and you know, you don\u2019t really know what looks good on you,\u201d and this and that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">I was just like, (chuckles) I felt really insulted by all of that, you know? Like... so I was like, \u201cYeah, I guess we have different values. You know, you\u2019re a corporate person, and your money is important to you. You imagine everything by money.\u201d I was just trying to like, explain to him what exactly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">you know, because like, I am trying to do something different, so... Yes, I\u2019m going to suffer financial hardships while I do it, and I\u2019m okay with that, and I\u2019m okay with, I\u2019m finally... I don\u2019t know how it happened, but I did finally get over the fact that I\u2019m living by myself, because, you know, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">like... not by mys , you know, with roommates, but... You know, I was terrified of that situation, you know. I was unable to leave Chris at all, you know? Like... because everything about that terrified me, and like... the place is dirty and all that, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">But somehow I got over all that just... and you know, most nights that I\u2019m not at Nelson\u2019s place I am at my place. But I knew, you know, I couldn\u2019t tell him that. So but I was like, you know, \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of this at all, but yeah, it is temporary. I don\u2019t expect to live like this forever and, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">know, the favors I take aren\u2019t really favors and, you know, they\u2019re more like...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">So he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, you keep saying your friends buy you drinks, and you\u2019ve known them for years so...\u201d Like, but they\u2019ve actually bought me two shots, you know? (chuckles) And I could very easily pay for them. It\u2019s just that I like saying those things, I like building this narrative of \u201cYeah, I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">all these people who, you know like, take care of me or pay for things for me.\u201d I just like thinking that, maybe because I didn\u2019t have such an experience growing up, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I was, you know mostly like, neglected as a child. So now I like, I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m surrounded by people who are... willing to... take care of me, or you know... That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have to worry about rent and bills and everything, you know? So I was, I guess, defending myself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">and I was really hurt by the whole like, you know, \u201cyour clothes are weird\u201d (chuckles) comment. Then later on, he was like, apologizing and crying profusely (chuckles), when he, I guess, realized that, you know, he had hurt me or like, I wanted to break up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">So I guess we patched up, but then I\u2019m just like... \u201cWhat is this, you know? In the sense that... (sighs) I feel really conflicted and odd and like... that I\u2019m betraying Chris, you know? Like, I think of him, that I\u2019m making him immensely sad. I just feel very responsible and, you know, guilty. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">very easy for me (chuckles) to feel guilty, so... It\u2019s never been a problem for me like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(pause) But it\u2019s just so like... I guess the initial impulse that had driven me away from him, saying, \u201cI have, I want to live my life, I want happiness, I\u2019ve been so unhappy for so long, I want the pain to end, la la la.\u201d That\u2019s kind of, you know, waned a little bit obviously, because I\u2019ve done all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">of those things and I\u2019ve, you know, had fun. But it\u2019s just so like, I don\u2019t know, addictive or, not even... I don\u2019t, maybe, maybe addictive is too strong a word. Maybe it\u2019s accurate, but I\u2019m just like drawn to it still, you know, because like... yesterday we went to the gym, and we played squash with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">his friend, and like... I don\u2019t, you know... that\u2019s fun to me and I couldn\u2019t... like... imagine doing that with Chris. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">I don\u2019t know like, like, this might be make the whole, this dichotomy. I always look at... at, you know, at this problem of looking at the world like, in a binary state of one thing is either\/or, you know. Either you have money or you don\u2019t have money or... yeah. Either you\u2019re idealistic or you\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">(chuckles). Yeah, I don\u2019t know. Like, I\u2019m like really drawn to how like, he\u2019s, like Nelson needs so much attention and he gives attention and like... wants attention. Chris is like, not like that at all like... You know, he\u2019s... cerebral and... (pause) I don\u2019t know, subdued, so... (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">I... feel myself like... I don\u2019t know, I guess I see, you know, I see it as beauty, too. But I feel more drawn towards like, the more like, outwardly energetic personality of Nelson. But I don\u2019t know. (pause) And I\u2019m just like, I just have to stop thinking about these two guys (chuckles) still you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">like... because... (inaudible) few more months of focusing on myself, you know and (inaudible) quiet (ph). It\u2019s like, the last, kind of, leg... and... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">(pause 00:15:21 to 00:15:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">I mean, it\u2019s great being independent and on my own. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s great about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Well... I don\u2019t know. I guess... There is an immense comfort. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right word. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s... There is discomfort, too. But there is like, this like... leaning that I sort of do, and there is like a humor in it, in the sense that I lean, and there is no one there <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">but me (chuckles), you know? And my past and my... present and some kind of vague idea of future. So... it\u2019s like, this like temporal me that I get to lean on (chuckles), you know what I mean? And I don\u2019t know. It feels like, solid and not solid at the same time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m having (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">trouble describing it, but it just feels like... I think that\u2019s what it feels like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">Because like, when there is... when I\u2019m with say, Chris, he is like, I\u2019m totally like, spineless. I sometimes feel... Most of our relationship I feel like I had been spineless. Maybe not, I don\u2019t know, because I had a job for most of our relationship. But even then, you\u2019re like, intellectually I allowed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">myself to be spineless in order to learn, even though, even when you\u2019re a student, you don\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t be spineless, or heartless (ph) or whatever. So I like, leaned on him for stuff and, you know, another person feels more solid. But there are also all these things that come with that like, expectations <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B2\">and this and that. You look at their flaws and they seem, they can seem gigantic or something. I don\u2019t know. But like, when I\u2019m independent... it just feels different. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">(pause) I don\u2019t think that worry has gone away, as to what would people think about me. But I feel like I can see me more clearly, you know. I still might think of myself as a basket case and people don\u2019t like me (chuckles), but... in a sense I feel like, I don\u2019t care! (chuckles) (pause) I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">there is a little less pressure now, because like, with Chris, I felt... or with anyone, I feel like, more under pressure to be, to measure up to like, some idea of like, an ideal... girlfriend or whatever, you know, partner. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">(pause) Like, we had this good-bye party for this young girl who is going to Nepal to be an independent journalist. Everyone was going around and doing their introductions. I don\u2019t know like, when it came to my turn, I suddenly thought that I would tell them about the summer. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">how that happened, but I just kind of... It wasn\u2019t more, I guess that was a little impulsive, but then I kind of wasn\u2019t very... I was very like, strategic about it. I didn\u2019t name any names, I just said, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re going, and I just wanted to share this with you, that the summer, I had kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">attracted some undue sexual attention and, you know, so...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">Her parents were there too, so I was like, \u201cYeah, you know, sorry, but you know, I\u2019m sorry to change the tone of the gathering, the conversation, but, I just want you to be careful and...\u201d Because people were like, giving her tips and stuff and silly things. \u201cOh, do this, eat that, you know? Get over <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">the virus, you know, this and that.\u201d So I was like, you know, practical tips. You know, \u201cTake a cell phone, take a smart phone and do this and, you know, how to avoid... (sighs) being in that situation.\u201d So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">I guess I was thinking about what that means like, am I still letting that incident define me, and how would people think of me. Then like, why am I the only one with such stories in like, polite conversations (which, you know, wasn\u2019t the case actually, because like, her mom was like, \u201cYeah, something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">like this happened to me. This driver was showing me dirty pictures and...\u201d) (chuckles) So it\u2019s like, all the women in the room were like, \u201cYeah, you know, this always happens and...\u201d So... I felt like I had, you know, brought up something difficult, but necessary and you know, it felt like, the burden <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">of it (chuckles)... I mean, I felt burdened, but then it was also like, you know like, dusted off, you know. It\u2019s, I\u2019m like a story... in a set of stories like, in a narrative and that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s fine. Then I just kind of left, and walked away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">So, because I didn\u2019t really want to stay in Arlington. Okay, how is this person\u2019s reaction to me, is it change, is it change, is it change, you know? (chuckles) (pause) I guess that\u2019s, it ties to like, my... and your comment about like, being independent. It\u2019s like... it\u2019s like that, you know. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">like, it comes with its costs. You come to a gathering and you have a story, and it may totally change the tone of everything, but you make your mark and you leave, you know. You hope that you have contributed and that\u2019s the extent of it. You hope (inaudible) already know, that\u2019s it. (chuckles) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200752\">you stand by your word, and you stand by your actions, and you take responsibility... and... yeah. (chuckles) (pause) I mean, it\u2019s not that new thing, so like you know... So I\u2019m not like, an old movie (ph) or anything, so... (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s not like, when I say, \u201cmake my mark\u201d or anything else, it\u2019s not like... you know, I went to outer space or something ridiculous like that. It\u2019s quite, you know, common or... you know, my story or whatever, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, what, the story about what happened over the summer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... I mean, just because I feel it intensely doesn\u2019t make it like, unique. (chuckles) So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you wanted to share something about what could happen in Nepal, or do you feel like you were also trying to share something about yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah... I don\u2019t know. Like, I can\u2019t differentiate between the two. People were like, \u201cYeah like, introduce yourself and like, if you don\u2019t say what we know about you, we\u2019ll fill in so...\u201d You know, we were doing that for each other. (chuckles) Then I was like... \u201cYou\u2019re going to Nepal, and here <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">is what happened to me. You\u2019re kind of going in a similar fashion to like, to write and like, chase stories. I did that.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">I guess I also wanted to show off. (chuckles) Because I felt like, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve done that! What you are doing is pretty cool! But I did that, too!\u201d (chuckles) Yeah, so... Because, you know, it was like, \u201cWell, here is a strong, independent woman.\u201d I wanted to come across that way, but then, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">It\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it ironic that, you know like, I wanted to come across as a strong independent woman, but I chose to share a story about how I was like, you know, kind of undone or like (chuckles)...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: What do you think about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: That just might be who I am, you know, it\u2019s like that. (chuckles) It\u2019s like, with great, you know like, with independence come all of these, you know like... you know, burdens or whatever, so. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always like, I guess I\u2019ve always been like this, where I\u2019m like, trying to be... <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">the most unique person in the room, you know? (therapist affirms) So... (chuckles) which is funny, because like, now that we\u2019re like, so old (chuckles) and have lived... All of us have had varied experiences, all of us are unique, but... I don\u2019t know. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to... burst everyone\u2019s happy <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">bubble,\u201d I don\u2019t know. (chuckles) Must have been a million reasons why I wanted to share that story. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: A lot of times, when you share what happens at one of these events, it\u2019s kind of light, or a little bit removed. But I imagine in the moment, you feel things very intensely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: That leads you to, you know, say what you say or do what you do, that it\u2019s very intense for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: Hmm... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Maybe casual is the word I\u2019m looking for, that when you\u2019re talking about it in here, there is a little bit of a casualness about it. But I don\u2019t imagine it feels casual to you at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely doesn\u2019t. Um... I don\u2019t... I know I definitely feel things intensely, and I don\u2019t know what exactly you want me to say about that like... I don\u2019t know. Whenever I hang out with these people, I sometimes... certain like, combination of factors makes me have like, intense reactions <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">to things. I don\u2019t know what it is. Like, what should I explore now? (chuckles) What do you want me to talk about? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t necessarily a directive. I was just sort of making a comment or an observation that I thought might be helpful for us to think about. (client affirms) It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWe should now talk about this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: No, but like, in what way helpful like... Like, what are we focusing on? Like the fact that I relate it casually later on or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: I mean, that\u2019s certainly one thing. I mean, I guess I was thinking about just, what I was wondering what that experience was like for you in these moments in the group. How you relate it after is interesting, too. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, oh, at the moment, yeah. Like, it\u2019s like my comparative mood is on. As I feel like, last time, this time was like, must be on for everyone because like, this woman who is going to Nepal like, her parents were... It was never... I don\u2019t really know her for very long like, for maybe a month. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">Her parents... they\u2019re you know like, ideal textbook parents (chuckles), you know? In the sense that, you know, her dad has always had a job like, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, I think he\u2019s a doctor or something. He\u2019s also kind of idealist and has gone to Africa to do some aid kind of work. (pause) The mom is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B2\">very pretty, brought up two kids and like, re-did all her education when she moved to the U.S. She rows (chuckles) like, in the Charles, the team or something. So, you know, I was thinking like, \u201cOh my gosh! I mean like, these guys could give anyone a complex, you know? Because they\u2019re like overachievers.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B3\">(chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">I don\u2019t know and like, my mom was there and like I just felt a little like, you know, not necessarily put down, but like, you know... And I didn\u2019t actually feel that very, that intensely at that moment, that \u201cOh my gosh, we are nothing and we don\u2019t have...\u201d I didn\u2019t feel it. I mean, they were, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">feeling it, but not as intensely as I have felt it in previous times, like a victim, victim like, they were... (sighs) I just felt old, you know? (chuckles) because I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s like maybe in her mid-20\u2019s. So... yeah. The intense feeling was that of like... of an outsider, I guess. And more so, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D2\">because I wasn\u2019t, you know, Chris was there, but like he wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t with him anymore. So, I felt like an outsider. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">And, it\u2019s funny because like, it was a very small gathering (chuckles) and I was one of the people invited. Obviously I was flattered, and I went and stuff, but like... And when I was introducing myself, people were like, \u201cYeah, no, she\u2019s a very good writer and this and that.\u201d I was, you know like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">it\u2019s always, you know, I\u2019m always happy to hear that. But it still like, you know, what you\u2019ve experienced... or what I\u2019ve experienced, you haven\u2019t experienced. That kind of makes me feel intensely like an outsider, or not understood, partly because I don\u2019t want to be understood. (chuckles) So... yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F2\">I guess, yeah, I feel those things intensely at these gatherings. I don\u2019t understand completely where that comes from, or maybe I do. Like, it\u2019s part of being insecure and... But I was hoping I would grow out of it a little bit, in terms of being independent and... I\u2019m wondering if I am growing out of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: What was it like, you know, sort of seeing and knowing a little about her parents, and you were there with your mother there? What was that like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: It was like I said, it wasn\u2019t that intense, because... (pause) (chuckles) It was like, it was senseless even, because like, her mom like, was telling us how like, her grandfather was this famous teacher at a famous university and... Yeah, so it was you know like, \u201cOh, you know, that\u2019s nice and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">you know, we, yeah, I\u2019ve been to that university.\u201d You know like, Chris was saying, \u201cYeah, my mom was kind of born there, too.\u201d So, I was kind of removed from it a little bit. I hadn\u2019t slept the night before, so I was tired and I wasn\u2019t like over-thinking like a maniac, like I usually do and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">(pause) And I was, you know, I had a fight with Nelson the night before and I was going to see him later on, so... And it was like, because of, so I think because of Nelson, because of seeing him, I feel like I\u2019ve already put one foot out the door at these gatherings (chuckles), which is like, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">is a good thing for me. (chuckles) Not in terms of like, \u201cOh, I feel like an outsider and this makes me feel even more like an outsider,\u201d but it kind of makes me feel removed like, I think of it more as a shield... you know? Because if I were with Chris... at that time like, you know, like Nelson was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A52\">not in the picture and then that, this event, evening would have been completely different in my head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">Because such things have happened in the past, and I would like, felt intensely like, \u201cOh my gosh, these people! They have everything and you know, illustrious families and lineages and this and that, and I have nothing!\u201d (chuckles) I don\u2019t feel it so much this time... because I didn\u2019t have the time <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A71\">to think. I think I should include that as a factor, time or energy to think, but like... (sighs) When my turn came to speak, I did tell them, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m writing this book and it\u2019s about this and it\u2019s about that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">I felt kind of secure in that, you know. I mean, it\u2019s a very insecure thing (chuckles), you know, writing itself is a very insecure thing. But... just that little concrete thing that it\u2019s, you know... that I could actually count the pages now and stuff, and the planning will fit, and the planning going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A91\">forward. That little bit of concreteness kind of gave me a tiny amount of security and... Then, you know, the story that I told was in terms of like, as an older kind of sisterly guidance. So that made me feel... like I came to this kind of scenario with my mom being there, and her parents being there <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A92\">as kind of like not equals, not equals, but like... almost equals, I don\u2019t know. Like... different, but... I could contribute, you know? Despite the fact that we were hopelessly... unequal in our upbringing and finances and... (pause) Because like, you know, that\u2019s the thing. Like, every person can <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A93\">contribute something, no matter what their financial background, you know? And that gives me hope that, you know, there is... there is some kind of... meeting point or there is some kind of value to that, even if people are not equal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">(pause 00:36:24 to 00:37:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">It was at the house of this woman that I have difficulty with. Like, in the sense that she was the one who had a birthday party and you know, didn\u2019t invite me and like, I saw the pictures on Facebook and stuff. I always have trouble with her, because like... I, the thought of her has depressed me before, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD1\">because you know, she was, she got married when she was 18 and... like her husband is, I don\u2019t know, 10-15 years older than him(sic), I respect him and appreciate him a lot, but her like, I\u2019m, I have a little trouble with, because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">(pause) She says like, she\u2019s weirdly confident and ill-informed. So that makes me feel very judgmental and yet, you know, she\u2019s a woman and we\u2019re in the same like, women\u2019s group and I\u2019m supposed to like, support her. Yet she\u2019s very cliquey, you know like, you know... because... and... Yeah, she like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF1\">whenever she meets a new girl, I feel like she wants to like, make friends with her, which is kind of, which has kind of been my mode. And I\u2019m like, so I guess I was feeling a little threatened, too, by that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">But then like, when I was leaving, I saw her at the laptop. I was just like, got like, this image of... I mean, I just kind of tried to understand her a little bit in the sense that, you know, if I were in her shoes, I would go crazy! (chuckles) Because, you know, she had a house full of people, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B11\">did at the moment, and you know, she has a husband and a child... and what if she wanted to be a writer? What if she was trying to write something. I remembered my, the same dilemma, I had the same dilemma you know, not too long ago, where I just felt so like... claustrophobic and you know like, \u201cThere <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B12\">is no space for me to write!\u201d Or you know, because like, my mom and Chris were living... under the same roof and... I mean, I fought and created my space and my time and Chris actually was quite understanding and helpful. I\u2019d go to the library, I\u2019d go to cafes and write. But you know, I just saw her <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B13\">as like, being hemmed in, and I felt bad for her, for just a little bit. (chuckles) But that doesn\u2019t mean that, you know like, as soon as she opens her mouth, she won\u2019t like, baffle me or (chuckles) annoy...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562674\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">(pause 00:39:56 to 00:40:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">Do you think I\u2019ll ever resolve my like, dilemma with Chris and Nelson?

What <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C51\">does that mean? I\u2019m not really sure what this means, but I think that like... now I feel, I\u2019m starting to feel the pressure (chuckles), you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Pressure of...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">CLIENT: Like, it was all very like, my conflict because I\u2019m just like... yeah. I\u2019m torn between the two of them, but still... Maybe time will take care of it, but I feel like in my head and in my heart, things are still kind of... they\u2019re confused. I\u2019m confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, when you first said \u201cresolved,\u201d I thought of it as more of kind of an emotional process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, that. That would be nice. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And then I thought of the \u201cmarried and child,\u201d I thought was sort of a \u201cclub\u201d that you want to belong to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">CLIENT: But not really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: But then, right, there is the flip side of looking at this woman. Maybe she\u2019s hemmed in or even worse, like your mother, is trapped (client affirms) by marriage. I think it\u2019s a very conflictual thing for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: It is. (chuckles) (pause) Which is weird, because like, I, immensely enjoy doing things for... others. Like, that\u2019s like my favorite part of being in a relationship. Oh, are we done or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">THERAPIST: We have a couple of minutes, you\u2019re fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah like, for Chris and even for Nelson. Now, he was like, \u201cOh, you made me tea when I was sick, that was when I...\u201d I was like, it was like... it was we haven\u2019t even scratched the surface like, that\u2019s nothing. I can do so much more, you know? (chuckles) So... I guess the other (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D91\">are two very different things. Like, doing nice things for your partner, versus the whole like... the cage or the commitment of marriage. (paus3) And I guess I\u2019m trying to have one without the other. (chuckles) So... It\u2019s like renting, you know like, versus buying a house. Like, all the renovations <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D92\">you can do to a rented place kind of feel like they go nowhere at the end of the day. But when you do it to your own house, it\u2019s something you own, it adds up. (chuckles) It feels like it adds up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">(pause 00:44:14 to 00:45:14)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Well, Cecelia, we\u2019re going to need to stop for today, okay?
