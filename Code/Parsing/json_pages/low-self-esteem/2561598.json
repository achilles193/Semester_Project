Those two great chairs [inaudible] are turned around a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah I know it\u2019s different. I was gonna ask have you gotten anything from the insurance yet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I did, and I was at the grocery store and was gonna go home first, but didn\u2019t, so it\u2019s like the first half is like $564 so I\u2019m gonna mail it to you, because I had it on my calendar and I was gonna run home and get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Great. Would you also if you don\u2019t need it would you mind e-mailing, uh mailing the explanation of benefits? I just want to be able to keep track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: No I don\u2019t need it at all. I\u2019ll just mail the whole thing. And then I just put on the back of it paid order, put your name and that\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s fine yeah. Usually what people do is they pay me and then they get reimbursed. But for grad students that typically on your<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Oh. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: For grad students I know sometimes you just don\u2019t have the money to put out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s why. So usually I don\u2019t keep track. That\u2019s why they have a system in place for this, because I usually don\u2019t <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Ohh, okay. It\u2019s different than the way it usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Right. I try to not have you put out too much money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s how I work it. So yeah usually I\u2019m not so off cycle. Okay. But I know that sort of. So anyway if you could just e-mail or mail them to me so that way I could<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: No, no problem. Okay, so in the past so it\u2019s been like a week or so, and I went home for a week. But before I went home I had an interesting experience so. I think I had mentioned to you before that I had had some issues with friends kind of in the past. Like not having friends that maybe weren\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">right for me and my life, but not knowing how to sort of like say no to them, or how to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: And so this particular group of friends that were people that I had used to work with. A couple of weeks ago they were having a party like a 30th birthday party for one of the girls, and it was sort of like 5 of us that were sort of friends in this group and they kind of left me out of the planning <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">of the party, and different things. And I have been busy with school so it\u2019s you know it\u2019s understandable, but it was a little hurtful and it kind of brought back these memories of being you know being left out in the past. It sort of brought back old old feelings. And sort of experiences that happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200432\">to me when I was like in middle school and high school with people leaving me out, or not including me, which is not really the way you wanna feel with adult friends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: It came to the party, and I actually went early to try to help them because I had the time, and you know tried to do all these things. And then I saw them kind of gathering to the side and there were other people there, and they were doing something I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">a couple of hours later an hour later they said everybody gather around, and we want to get a gift to this girl\u2019s party it was. So it was all of them except for me giving this gift, and they got her a you know JetBlue gift card and said we are all gonna go to Vegas. But in this whole thing and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200452\">like [inaudible] and then you know people in the back were asking me do you know what this is, do you know? And I said no I don\u2019t know what it was I wasn\u2019t included, and the feeling it was like it was really weird because usually I\u2019m like pretty okay I wasn\u2019t included I can, but I think I had been feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200453\">this like hurt kind of left out feeling and that was the culmination for some reason. That was like just made everything come back and made me feel like I was a little kid again, not being included. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: It was really weird, and my boyfriend was there and he turned to me and said are you okay? And I said no I actually not okay, and I had to actually leave the room because it wasn\u2019t necessarily like the action or what was really happening then. It was the feeling that it brought back. And in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">a way though it was really cathartic almost. Like it was sort of like this is what I needed to make me realize that these are not people I want in my life, and these are not positive friendships. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: And I may have been, you know, there may have been very legitimate reasons, I\u2019m in grad school so they didn\u2019t include me, and you know. There are different reasons for it I\u2019m sure. But it just made me realize that I don\u2019t want friends to make me feel that way, and that moment and that realization <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">allowed, gave me what I needed to sort of like know that I had to phase them out of my life. And it took all of that for that moment, or that realization to happen and then it kind of allowed me to reflect back on the rest of the friendships in my life right now that I have maintained and to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">out you know actually these are really good, the other friends are really good friends, and they know me and they don\u2019t make me feel this way, and those are positive things in my life now that I have that you know are you know people that know me from college, and these other friendships that make me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200493\">feel like I did when I was younger are not what I want to have in my life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: But it was just, it was a really weird overreaction because it wasn\u2019t me reacting to what was happening. And that it was me feeling like the girl that was left out. Like it was like I can\u2019t even, you know I can\u2019t even explain it because the emotions were so intense, the feeling of just you how <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">could they be so mean? It was almost like that mean girls kind of feeling, and.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You feeling small and helpless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was just all the feelings that I don\u2019t want to have to have, you know. As an adult, and I shouldn\u2019t have to have them because I don\u2019t have to go to high school every day with people. I can choose who is in my life and whether or not whatever they were doing, whatever reason it was for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">regardless of that I don\u2019t feel good when I\u2019m around them and I don\u2019t think I should have people like that in my life, and I\u2019ve never before I met them these particular group of girls. I don\u2019t think I really ever experienced those feelings so fully again since like when I was a lot younger. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: So it was just weird to experience them again. But I think it really like. It was almost like it brought me back to a weird place but in a way I\u2019m looking at it as a good thing because it allowed me to realize like these are not I can choose who is in my life, and I don\u2019t want them to be in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">my life. And I don\u2019t have to be like I\u2019m never talking to you again. I can just kind of just say no to them and just kind of, but it was it just it took that experience for me to realize that. But I thought I just thought it was weird. That it brought back stuff that I haven\u2019t felt or experienced in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">a long time, and it was quite, it was really painful. Just because I never. I haven\u2019t been brought back to that place in so long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: So it was I mean it was crazy to me to have that experience but like I said I\u2019m looking at it as like as a really positive thing because its allowing me to like remember those feelings and to know that I don\u2019t have like I know now that I don\u2019t have to feel that way, and I don\u2019t have to be around <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">people that might make me feel that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: And ironically enough though I sort of went home for the holidays and I have a non profit that I\u2019m on the board of and other people, my friend from high school had started, so the other people that are on the board are these people from high school that were like the popular kids that I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">always made me feel so great about myself, but the ironic thing is that now as adults when I see them they are so kind to me, and so nice, and made me feel really welcome and we all have these you know great like mature relationships. So the people that may have made me feel that way a long time ago <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">when I like I\u2019m totally fine with them now, and actually think oh you know we\u2019ve known each other for a long time, and like it\u2019s almost like not a bad relationship at all. So that\u2019s what I mean is the funny thing is they\u2019ve maybe matured out of their behaviors, and so we all have these fine mature adult <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200553\">relationships. And these other girls that I\u2019m meeting in my adult life are the ones that are making me feel like I did so many years ago, so it was just kind of funny to me that oh you know the people that may have made me feel that way a long time ago they have moved past that and we all you know are <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200554\">like totally fine with each other and I actually feel really comfortable with them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: But then there are these other people that I\u2019ve met that bring back these feelings and I just don\u2019t want to stay away from them kind of. So it was a really, it was just a really strange experience to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It sounds weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: And I just, I\u2019m almost feeling like you know because of this I felt therapy actually helped me to bring that back, because they don\u2019t, because these girls have been acting this way towards people and things for awhile and I\u2019ve known them for several years. So I think it took being able to like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">in a way it was good to be able to equate what they were doing to those feelings in the past because it was it gave me the ability to realize like this is wrong, and I don\u2019t want this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: So actually it was like really painful at the time, but I don\u2019t feel bad about it anymore. I don\u2019t feel I don\u2019t feel a sense of loss. Like a lot of times if I think someone is not great for me to have in my life I have trouble moving away from them because I still feel like a sense of loss. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">But with this experience fazing them out of my life I don\u2019t feel that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying this was almost cathartic. I don\u2019t feel that sense of loss, I feel like it\u2019s the right thing to do, and I don\u2019t feel bad about it. So, and normally I would. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: So it was odd that it needed to be that kind of experience for me to be able to do that, but I\u2019ve never been able to let go of people that I knew weren\u2019t positive without feeling bad about it, or guilty, or feeling a sense of loss. And with this situation it\u2019s like I feel like I\u2019m justified <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">so I won\u2019t feel any of that, so yeah. Interesting experience but<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: And this is before you went home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: This is before I went home, so I was worried. I was so worried about going home and what was gonna happen and then this actually happened before I went home. So I was like, oh great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: But when I went home what was interesting is that I noticed that my mom was trying to not talk about other people, and I don\u2019t know where that came from, but her sisters had been visiting who are very calm and try to talk stuff through with her. So I think they might have spoken with her, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">she definitely had her periods where she was acting you know crazily. But she also had periods where I could tell that she was really trying to watch what she was saying and to have a real and meaningful conversation. Like I wanted to show her some documentaries about food and that I thought interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">and she actually sad with me and watched them and we talked about like organic, like it was different stuff that I was learning that I thought was interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: And she wanted to learn more about the science and like so for us to have these other conversations that was definitely really, that was positive. So there were surprisingly actually positive pieces of the visit which I was really happy about that and I mean there were also the guilt, the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">you know like the usual kind of stuff was still there, but there was positive, which was sometimes there is no positive, so that was I was really happy about that. But there was still like in the beginning you know there was the frustration where she would say like I want you to go to these places and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">do xy and z and I thought I haven\u2019t figured out what we are gonna do yet, and then she would say well I guess, the whole guilt type of dynamic and then me getting frustrated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: There was that, but then I think I tried a little bit harder to be more patient, and then I think she was trying a little bit harder. Well she was trying. Maybe not harder, but she was actually finally trying, and so I think between both of us trying it helped for us. It let us have these better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">moments, which was good. So it wasn\u2019t there weren\u2019t as many negative things as I thought there was going to be. I was really expecting the worse, but because you know we, my boyfriend and I went into Philadelphia one day. Like we did other stuff too to kind of break it up. And then we made a schedule <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">and told her what our plans were ahead of time so she felt better. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: So we kind of like there was kind of like a give and take type of thing. So I might have had to try harder than I wanted to, or I felt like I was giving in a little bit more to her behaviors because normally I would just get so frustrated that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to talk to her, but this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">time I felt like I was kind of like complacent kind of you know, okay we\u2019ll walk just to try to get her to not get riled up. So, but that actually helped for us to have a better relationship. During the week, which was good. And she didn\u2019t force me to go to church either. Which was also a break so there <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B2\">was it was kind of like you know both sides trying I think? So that experience wound up being more positive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Then I thought it was going to be, and then the other experience before that one being way more negative in a way than I expected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Do you think what happened before you left at this party impacted what happened with you and your mom at home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: I think that it might have because I sort of had this like mental breakthrough where I want to say that it may me realize what was important to me in my life. It was, I\u2019m sorry; it was because it really was like a breakthrough I think. It was very odd like, it was like I found some kind of a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">clarity. It was like really weird to me because it made me realize, it made me be able to see what was positive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: In my life and to want more of that, and to realize that I could have some control over the negative. So I think it made me realize, hey if I just, if I\u2019m a little less stubborn, and you know get a little less frustrated with my mom then I can maybe have like a more productive relationship with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">her if I just try a little bit more. Because it made me see. I\u2019m not sure that if the other thing with the friends had happened before I\u2019m not sure if I would have been able to necessarily see the positive things that were happening. But for some reason I feel that what happened there allowed me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">see a lot more positive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Like even stuff with my boyfriend. Like sometimes I got frustrated with him like, oh we didn\u2019t buy gifts for your family yet, and you know all the different stuff like that. But then on the flip side because of what happened I was seeing okay you know we didn\u2019t buy gifts for his family yet because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">he hasn\u2019t had time to come with and he wants to be involved, all right. But on the flip side look at all these really sweet really great things that he did for me this past week. Look how he helped me out when I wasn\u2019t feeling well, and we went into the city. Like I realized that all these great things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200752\">overshadowed the one like littler thing that wasn\u2019t actually that big of a deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: So for some reason like my thinking has started changing after what happened, because I used to feel like well maybe all my friends are sort of toxic because this one friend was toxic, and how do I see the good in my friends? And how can I see the good in I mean I really struggled with that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">and I really felt like I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust a lot of friends and stuff, and then once this happened with this one group it just made me see my other friendships and like with my other friends who I\u2019ve known for so long. It made me see those friendships in a really positive light, and to realize <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">like hey like this person has been there for me through all this and we really enjoy our time together. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: And it made my see my experience as with my other friends and with other people in a different other people that I\u2019ve realized are generally there for me, in a different light. So it was kind of like just this experience has allowed me to see that I have a lot of people in my life that truly <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">care about me. Which I\u2019m not sure I was able to see before that. So it was kind of like, it was almost like seeing the light that wasn\u2019t there before. It was actually, so it was like a really powerful experience actually, but it\u2019s just allowed me to see a lot more good than I was able to see before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Because before I just saw everything that was wrong. And I felt like there was so much that was wrong. And now I\u2019ve started feeling like there\u2019s so much really good. And I\u2019m like so happy about the rest of the friends I have in my life, and it\u2019s almost like I want to actually like get some more <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">genuine time with them. It just I really feel that I went through a period where nothing was making me happy, or making me feel fulfilled because I was so mistrusting of everything. And I don\u2019t feel like I just its weird like I just don\u2019t, I mean I\u2019m sure there is a little bit of mistrust but I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B2\">don\u2019t feel that way anymore like I feel like I have a lot of people in my life that really are there for me, and have been for a long time, and really care about my wellbeing. And just genuinely want to be there for me and they don\u2019t want to do anything bad to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: And being able to see that makes me feel really lucky because I mean I know it was always there, but I don\u2019t think I was able to see it before. So I mean so I think that it definitely, all this happening, definitely effected what happened with my mom in a positive way. And I think that it effected <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">even spending time with relatives and talking with them in a really positive way. Because I had some really great conversations with Aunts and Uncles. I saw some of my boyfriend\u2019s family and just spending time with them and realizing that they really appreciate me and everything that I do, and they <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">genuinely care for me, and have a caring relationship and then just being able to see all the stuff that my boyfriend has been doing for me and how much he cares. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: He really cares about me. It was just. It was stuff that I don\u2019t think I was able to see before. So it was almost like a cloud kind of was<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Lifting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Lifted. Yeah. Because I\u2019m definitely seeing things in a way that I don\u2019t think I have been able to see them that way for a long time. So it was it was kind of like eye opening. Like it was almost like when someone gets cataract surgery and they can finally see everything again it was kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Being able to see everything from a different vantage point almost. And just realizing how much good there is that I didn\u2019t see before. (pause) So yeah it was good. But yeah it just I think that it\u2019s maybe also not feel guilty if I see any negative things or bad things kind of like creeping <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">in again or if you know I mean the hard part is going to be is that I really felt terrible about myself around those girls and I don\u2019t want to be around them, but they are still gonna reach out to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: And so the hard part is going to be just like saying no and distancing myself. And continuing to not feel guilty as they continue to reach out. Because after like all the initial stuff I realized you know I don\u2019t want them in my life. I don\u2019t feel bad about it, but as people continue to reach <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">out to you eventually it could wear on me so I think the hard part is going to be not just with them but even with other people or other things in my life just realizing like that I have a choice over who I let in my life. And realizing that I do have all these great people that I have known for a long <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200872\">time that really do care about me, and that I don\u2019t need to add people that could be negative just to be nice to them so that they are happy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Because that is just gonna take away from the good in my life. So the hardest part is gonna be kind of like continuing that and not feeling like well if I say no to them then they are gonna feel bad or you know they are gonna say this because that doesn\u2019t matter. Because it\u2019s not worth making <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200891\">them, like it\u2019s not worth it to make them happy. But if I\u2019m gonna feel bad because I\u2019m more important than their feelings or what they are saying. So I know that, and I want to, it\u2019s almost like I want to preserve this feeling, and I don\u2019t wanna let my feelings of you know what are they going to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200892\">of me and all that stuff creep back in because I realized how toxic it is to think that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s impeding on my own happiness, and my wellbeing, which is more important than their life and like I need to worry about myself first. And so I think that is gonna be the hardest thing because there are gonna be more people like that that I come across. And they are going to be, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">group is going to keep reaching out to me to do things. Its gonna take awhile for you know. And so I think the hardest thing is going to be remembering that I need to put myself first. Because if I forget that then I feel like if I let them back into my life it can bring back some of this like toxic <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B2\">kind of like feelings and stuff that I don\u2019t want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: So I want to be able to remember that my feelings need to come before theirs or anyone else\u2019s for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What do you think would lead you to forget that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">CLIENT: Its sort of like falling I think falling back on like old habits, like not maybe I had a bad day or something, I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just trying to think of like. Well for example they had kept, they texted me a lot over Christmas and it was like group text and I didn\u2019t answer any of them, but then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200911\">felt kind of guilty. A little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: Because I thought about this one girl. Because there are a couple of people in the group like the girl whose birthday it was actually who I actually really I think that they are good people. I think there are other people they are surrounded by that aren\u2019t good. So it\u2019s well I thought to myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">I should really at least reach out to Betty to tell her Merry Christmas back because she\u2019s you know I really like her. So then I reached out to her, and then but then me reaching out to her lead to her sending a group e-mail about I guess. It\u2019s sort of me feeling like there are a couple of people that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200932\">are good people and I feel bad about cutting them out of my life because of the people they surround themselves with. So maybe I should try to you know say respond back to them, but then that leads to me being included. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: And so then I think like the bad habit. I feel like my bad habits are the guilt in worrying will this person be hurt, or what are they thinking of. I think that could eventually. I could eventually rationalize in my mind that these people are so hurt, and they are good people that I need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200951\">like reach out. You know reach out to them or give in to getting together with them. Like I think that guilt building up in the back of mind because to me it\u2019s like well two of these people that really hurt me, it\u2019s really the rest and they are just influenced by them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s sort of like I feel like totally okay with not speaking to three of them but not that okay with not speaking to the other two. And so I think that is kind of like the issue is that it\u2019s gonna, it could build up enough that I give in. So while I know that I need, I know that I need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200971\">put myself first because I want to preserve these good feelings, I\u2019m afraid that my habit of caring so much about other people and their feelings would eventually lead me to like giving in. Like kind of like I would build it up over time like it\u2019s been so long I feel really bad, I feel that I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200972\">eventually give in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t want to do that. But I think that is what could happen, because even though I had this really good breakthrough and I really see everything in a different way I still am going to have the habits and you know the back of my mind of worrying about and caring what others think. Even <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200991\">though now I realize how toxic it was, and is to me. Like I think that now I can realize that that\u2019s, it\u2019s like when you feel so good you don\u2019t want to go back to feeling bad, and you know what made you feel bad. But at the same time kind of like an addiction or something you could still fall back on <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200992\">because you still have the tendency to do these things because that\u2019s who you are. You have established these habits. So it\u2019s sort of like you know that\u2019s what makes you feel bad but you need to break the habit and if you let your guard down you might fall back into the old ways type of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s sort of how I feel about it. Like I feel like okay like I feel really good now, and I feel this great but what if I have a bad day or something and I let my guard down, and then I forget how good I felt. You know I forget something and then I fall back into this old way. I feel like that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B1\">one thing that could happen and I don\u2019t want to let that, like I don\u2019t want to let them back in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">CLIENT: Because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just with them there could be. The thing is I could meet other people in my life or there could be other people that I come across that want my friendship, and want to take from me in a way. And want to you know whether they mean to or not, hurt me and do hurt me because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D1\">I let them. Like how, I\u2019m just worried about, it almost seems like I feel like okay I\u2019ve assessed everyone in my life and I know what\u2019s good, and I\u2019ve gotten rid of them, and everything is good now. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to meet new people throughout life and how do I know that these new, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D2\">how do I? Sort of like how do I know then the new people are trustworthy and how can I tell that they are not going to do you know the same things. Although I think with these girls the ones that you know are hurtful and nontrustworthy I think in a way I knew that from the beginning it\u2019s just sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D3\">like I worked with them, and you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F\">CLIENT: I think part of me knew that they weren\u2019t genuine, but I just went with it. So I\u2019m just worried that you know I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m going to have trouble when I come across new people letting anyone new in. Because it\u2019s like now I have this great status quo. So if I let someone new in what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F1\">if they\u2019re gonna do the same thing? What if they\u2019re the you know what if I start caring more about their feelings than my own? What if the same things happen when I let this new person in? How do I figure out if they\u2019re genuine or not? So like I\u2019m a little bit worried about that because in a way it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F2\">like okay you know like I was saying I know who is okay. And I\u2019m a little bit worried about going forward and letting new people in because I\u2019m almost in a way don\u2019t trust my own judgment because <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what it sounds like to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s sort of like maybe I trust my own judgment in the sense that in the back of my mind I know if someone is not a genuine person, but then I care so much about what they think that it overrides what is going on in the back of my mind head. And so it\u2019s sort of like, it\u2019s almost like moving <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A31\">forward I don\u2019t trust myself not to fall back into my like addiction of putting it that way, of caring too much about what other people think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I haven\u2019t been able to practice yet. Really you know not doing that with new people. And it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m because I haven\u2019t been able to, I\u2019m worried that I can\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And you have a particular way of framing it in terms of breaking habits, being addicted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s sort of very behaviorally framed. It\u2019s less psychologically framed like what would the motivation be in creating that and so forth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Which is interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well at this point I\u2019m almost feel like it\u2019s more of a behavior and less psychological because it really feels like it\u2019s not something I think through. It\u2019s like my natural, it\u2019s like riding a bike, and my natural tendency would be to care too much about what other people think because I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B11\">been that for so long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t even do it, like I don\u2019t even consciously do it. It\u2019s just like happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Right and that\u2019s<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">CLIENT: That\u2019s how it feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about that. The distinction you are making is that if it\u2019s not conscious it\u2019s not psychological then. Which is interesting? So then it could be unconscious and psycho. Maybe I\u2019m just parsing words but I\u2019m just thinking about, I\u2019m like listening to how you are framing it. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B91\">thinking that I do think, I do definitely think there is a habit part to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">THERAPIST: But I think that\u2019s only a part of it. And I think the other part is psychology, which I appreciate isn\u2019t like you think okay now I\u2019m doing this, and I gotta do this. I understand that piece. I mean I understand that it\u2019s unconscious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think the reason that I you know fall back into this is because of you know did start with becoming hyper aware when I was younger of appearance, of all those things. So like it started with becoming so hyper aware, but now it\u2019s just how I, it\u2019s like how I exist. So for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF1\">not it takes a big effort for me to not exist that way. Or think that way, or be so hyper aware. Like it\u2019s takes a huge effort for me to let go, and letting go, I think I\u2019ve let go a lot more than I ever have before. And now and it feels so good, and so great, but I\u2019m worried that like at certain (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF2\">I don\u2019t know how to explain how it like happens when I slip back into like my like I\u2019m. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C1\">CLIENT: Because I mean it happened at like one instance over Christmas where I hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to get all the gifts that I wanted to get for James\u2019s Aunt before we saw her to give her her gift, and I was like fixated on that one thing, and was freaking out about it. Even though I knew she wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C11\">care. And so James was trying to figure out why. He was like you\u2019re having a panic attack and I\u2019m trying to figure out it\u2019s not because of this and its because of something else, and I\u2019m trying to figure out, he was trying to figure out what is going, what else is going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C3\">CLIENT: And it could have been because later in the day we were going to see family and friends that I hadn\u2019t seen in like 5 years, and I could have been worried about them. Like there was, definitely was something else going, but sometimes it\u2019s harder for me to figure out what it is, because I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C31\">and I can slip back into these ways of thinking, and now the stress of thinking that way is so strong for me that I actually have a panic attack. So it\u2019s so uncomfortable for me to fall back into that now that I like now that I know what it\u2019s like to kind of like relax a little. It\u2019s so uncomfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C32\">for me to think that way that I actually will like have pretty much panic attacks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C5\">CLIENT: When I start like obsessing, and then thinking about well what are they gonna think of me, and what are they gonna think of me. It\u2019s like it feels so bad that I really do start hyperventilating and my chest gets, I start having a full blown panic attack. But I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t what is really triggering <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C51\">falling back into that way of thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well I mean part of what is triggering it is that it is familiar. Why this causes you panic is interesting. Like I understand it\u2019s unpleasant and that\u2019s why you panic but I don\u2019t know what. We are going to need to stop but I don\u2019t know what to make of that, but it\u2019s interesting. I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C71\">think about it together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I would definitely like to work through that because it\u2019s familiar but now going back to that it just feels so terrible to me, and I just start. I start really getting into it though. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB\">CLIENT: Like it\u2019s not like my usual like I have to do this what are they going to think. It\u2019s like really a sense of like panic. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s more severe. It\u2019s less frequent that I\u2019m thinking this way, but it more severe when it happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561598\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Well let\u2019s think through this, and unfortunately we have to stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF\">CLIENT: No that\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D1\">THERAPIST: To stop for today.
