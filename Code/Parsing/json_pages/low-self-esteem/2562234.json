(pause 00:10:29 00:11:08) I guess\u2014I don\u2019t know. Like I\u2019ve been thinking. (pause 00:11:10 00:11:21) I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m analyzing conversations after the day or kind of\u2014or\u2014yeah. Just kind of critiquing them. I don\u2019t know. (pause 00:11:35 00:11:43) It\u2019s just kind of bringing. It\u2019s kind of\u2014I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">don\u2019t know.

(pause 00:12:02 00:12:10) I don\u2019t know. For some reason, I want to say it\u2019s like my screen saver kind of like.

(pause 00:13:49 00:14:10) I guess I was thinking of it as like (pause 00:14:12 00:14:17) screen saver is actually there to avert a danger, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: (pause 00:14:19 00:14:24) Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:14:24 00:15:06) All right.

(pause 00:15:47 00:15:52) And you kind of start working on something else.

Is, you know, if a day dream is supposed to (pause 00:18:58 00:19:02) be, you know, a little pleasant, a little restorative, or to like help manage my anxiety a little bit about something. (pause 00:19:08 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">00:19:12) Often for you, it kind of works the opposite way.

But those things aren\u2019t happening right or I don\u2019t have any control over. (pause 00:19:57 00:20:03) I don\u2019t know.

So, it\u2019s like you\u2019re kind of in a way thinking of the right things to daydream about, but somehow what happens is it (pause 00:20:20 00:20:27) like exacerbates the worries that you\u2019re focusing on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Right.

I mean that might be slightly affected by it, but they\u2019re not kind of\u2014they don\u2019t worry about it or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">kind of feel or analyze it or kind of use it to\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. To kind of like form judgment or kind of\u2014I don\u2019t know. A caution or something like I do or something. Like I feel like people are more\u2014when they\u2019re\u2014I don\u2019t know. But like their, I guess, mode of just to like\u2014I don\u2019t know. More <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">interested in the things that (inaudible) think about. Things that I\u2019m more interested in that are kind of outside of people or conversations.

So, it seems to me, you know, if you\u2019re worried I\u2019m thinking that by thinking about some people and situations. I mean that you do that you\u2019re overwrought or even more so like, you know, that you\u2019re just crazy or really out of kilter or something like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">(pause 00:35:45 00:35:51) It seems to me that part of what you want is kind of reassurance from me that that\u2019s not so. But I think (pause 00:35:59 00:36:04) something related to that is (pause 00:36:06 00:36:13)\u2014I kind of want to know if I and other people do the same thing in one fashion or another. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">In other words, whether (pause 00:36:21 00:36:28)\u2014whether I\u2019m wanky that way.

(pause 00:36:48 00:36:58) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200413\">Am I having that kind of reaction to it? Even though it\u2019s not quite the same reaction as you have. (pause 00:37:04 00:37:08) Is that kind of saying on my mind or in thinking about that or dreaming about it are you just very different? It seems to me that that\u2019s kind of associated with the reassurance <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200414\">that you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: (pause 00:37:28 00:37:54) I mean I think I just (inaudible)\u2014if something was bothering so on or something happened like an argument they might think it was about that argument and not the other person kind of the way I do (inaudible) playing with my mind. And analyzing it and, you know, being <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">angry. But I feel like I\u2019m kind of that way. I don\u2019t know. Importance. You know, small things.

I think I just seen that\u2014yes. I\u2019m sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">some people are kind of like me. Kind of worry a lot what other people are thinking or kind of analyzing it. But most of the time\u2014I don\u2019t know. (pause 00:38:56 00:39:03) I don\u2019t know.
