(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: What would that look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Like we started doing that, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: That's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I'm sure you could be impartial (ph with Chris); even if you're not, it works for my benefit.

I'm curious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Because you'd be partial to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And that would be great! (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Ohhh. What would that look like? What would I do that would show my partiality to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Well, you would reprimand (ph? Chris) for... whatever. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: We could gang up on him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay! What would I reprimand him for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I don't know. He's not very \"reprimandable\" in the sense that no one ever finds anything wrong with him, so they think he's all right. (chuckle) (pause) We understand that because... having to tell someone else, or like maybe like, starting from scratch, it should be a good thing, but then, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like that's the only reason you'd like... if you saw someone else, I guess they would be less likely to reprimand him or else I could be on your team... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: No, no, no. Really, I was just joking about that, because, you know, I don't find (ph Chris) guilty of much, so... (chuckles). I just thought it would be, I just wondered if it would be possible. Because, the thing you know that, the relationship aspect pretty well, so I just wondered if it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">would be kind of easier (chuckles) for...everyone. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: (Chuckles) Well, if this is true, it's just a reverse then, if (ph Chris) is seeing someone individually for six months, would you want to be in couples therapy with that person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Um... yeah, sure, I mean... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Would you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, because they would... I would be... challenging, but... well, imagining talking to his friend, say, for example (inaudible 00:03:20) and I dread him, his friend. But I would assume, you know, that guy, he's, you know, and rely on his kind of good judgment and not, you know, lump everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">on me. (chuckles) And perhaps that friend has been critical of (ph Chris) as well...which is easier for a therapist to do than a friend, actually, so... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: So, are you bringing up in a humorous sense, or are you hoping that I would agree to see the two of you? 00:04:07}<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: No, I'm just wondering. I'm not expecting anything. I just assumed that it would not be possible, but I just kind of... asked, just wondering. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Does it feel, would it feel like less anxiety provoking, is that a piece of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because I'm so used to coming here and talking to you and (ph Chris's) also already done it and, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: And so talking to someone else, what do you imagine that would feel like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Like, I mean, it's a complete unknown, right? So... I guess it would be okay, but, you know, still... (chuckles) Something familiar and known is more, kind of, appealing, or you just agree to it more readily, so... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559448\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And then I can help you to whip him into shape. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: No. (chuckles) He's not, like I said, he's not... he's probably near perfect. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Well, for someone else, I'm sure he's perfect. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, I can give you lots of reasons if you want, well, not lots, but the reason that I don't see people like that, but... You can imagine that makes (ph some 00:05:39) of them, (ph though) why would be a problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs) Yeah, absolutely. Just wondered. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I mean, for starters, I know your deep ambivalence about him, and the complexity. It's certainly not something I would share with him, because that's something that you've told me in confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But then, so I just sort of monitor myself all the time to make sure I don't share it? There is a lack of freedom on my way to really help the two of you, so I'm sort of protecting. Not that it's a secret, but it's a confidence that you have given to me. So, that's one of the reasons; and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">our goals are very different. I don't know, you know... I'm here to figure out whether, you know, among other things, whether you want to be with (ph Chris). When I work with a couple, I'm there to help them make their relationship better. It's a very different kind of focus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">I mean, I'm concerned about each person individually, but I'm more interested in a much more focused goal: How can we help make your relationship better? If during the course of that process, one person decides they don't want to be in the relationship anymore, that's fine; but that's not really my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">goal, to help them figure that out. You know, I have a much more specific goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: (pause) Okay. (chuckles) Yeah, it makes sense. (pause) Yeah, I've just been talking to him, but he hasn't agreed to do it yet. Maybe once the semester is going, and he knows the rhythm and stuff, the schedule, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Do you want to do it? Is it something that you feel would be helpful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Well, I'm a little apprehensive, because, well, (ph for instance now), it would be, would take (ph Chris's) time, so... I definitely want to relate to him better and kind of, get rid of some of the negativity, but... it's something that I can learn now... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Well, it's also complicated because you're not sure, ultimately, this is the right relationship for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: I just don't know why that is, because, like, on paper it looks perfect. (chuckles) I feel like it's all just in my head that's keeping me from entering into it fully (inaudible), enjoying (ph theirs 00:08:33) (chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well, isn't a relationship all in someone's head? I mean, it's two people's head! It's two different experiences that, hopefully, satisfy each person's experience enough to be together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: It's also life, though, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: It's also life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: I mean, there are no relationship objectively outside of your experience and his experience. That's the relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I just don't want to be a relationship with anyone! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: I don't know... feel scared and stuff.

I said any other, because I meant, you know, except for (ph Chris) because... right now, we're like, I either live with my mom or with somebody (inaudible)... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">(chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: That's not true. You also lived on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: But I couldn't... so, like, financially that was impossible, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I think that you have a lot more feelings about what goes on between your mothers and you, especially when she asks for money, than we've talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, you know, it's not ideal, but I just don't try to think about it so much, because I can't help it right now. If I had a job, I definitely would think more about it, you know, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well, not feeling like you have no power to do something about something doesn't mean that you don't have feelings about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: And there are always a price that's paid when you push things aside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, true. (pause) What do you mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: First of all, there's a lot of energy expended, even if you're not aware of expending that energy. (pause) In general, I feel that pushing feelings away always comes at a price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, that's probably... that's true for, like, stuff that's happened in the past, like in my childhood and stuff. It's like a huge backlog of feelings. (chuckles) Like, you talk about feelings right now, I'm talking about feelings ten years ago (chuckles). This feeling, probably I'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">feel, you know, ten years later. So like, I guess I don't worry about it right now. (chuckles) Maybe I won't have to worry about it at all if, you know, if I'm still able to make something of my life, despite all these constraints, (chuckles) you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Why don't you want to think about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Because I can't help it. If I sit and think about it... but, you know, I feel mad inside and just waste time. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: I think it sounds like being in a war.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Well, like, when you're in a war, you're in the trenches, right? I mean, you probably have a lot of feelings like fear and anger and despair but you have to (ph spite) the war of what are you going to do about it? That's sort of what came... it's like I'm trying to think about a situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">where you have a lot of feelings, but you have no choice and that's what came to my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Quite dramatic!

I'm not sure I understand ideal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Like, you know, I expect the feeling of feelings, or like not being at war, not being in the trenches, like how could I make that happen in this situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, to start with, by trying, by talking about some of the things you are feeling about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: What I said, like Monday, I don't accept it, and I think of it as buying my freedom, so (chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: That's your thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Is that your feelings? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well, you know...

And I just can't take it. (chuckles) Whenever, you know, with them, so... And he just sits meekly and takes it and I'm like, \"No, that's not how it's done.\" (chuckles) And they're okay with it, they're you know, I don't need to shout <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">at them at all. That's just for my sake I shout. You know, other people have other things. People who I think are so free wherever... you know, like (ph arguing). It's not hard for me to be critical of him, but, you know, I'm trying now as well. He (ph sends) when (ph you want him to 00:18:29... but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B12\">you're... maybe if there is dating night, it doesn't depend on him as much as in my case, but, still, you know... he wants to make (ph film, then I'm, then he's going at full stop) and... As far as I can see, there is no (ph film) happening in the near future. ...never (inaudible), you know, then that's it. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: So in sticking up for (ph Chris's) father, you must feel somehow he's not able to stick up for himself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: No, I just... it's like, his mom is a bully and I'm also a bully, like, so I kind of, don't like her bullying. I just don't like the nastiness; I just don't like the crabbiness that makes everything yucky. And it's like, you know, flash from my childhood and I don't want to be in that place <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">at all, and I don't want anyone else to be in that place. It's like a very visceral reaction, and it's like \"Do something about it, right then and there.\" (pause) (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess... I know it's more complicated than this, but if you can be bullying, if you see her as a bully, then... isn't it okay if she bullies? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: No, because I'm a nice bully! (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I see. And she's a mean bully?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: What makes you a nice bully?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Um... if ultimately I love the person I'm bullying. (laughs) I know the big picture, and I can see it and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And she doesn't love her husband?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Maybe she does, but she's very mean about it. Yeah, she has very different ways of showing love, I guess. You know, a different generation would, so... (pause) I guess I also am starting to feel bad for her, but... she wanted to do this and that and the other, but couldn't for various reasons, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">so... You know, at least her husband has somewhere to go to every day, you know, but... some work to accomplish and all the result of that, and all that.

It just mean like, you know, he's out, you know, you should stop (ph thinking about him), but... You know, like (chuckles) (pause) He's in Nepal right now, my (ph Chris). He couldn't even drop a line saying, you know, \"My parents are okay, you need to know that.\" He said he would, so... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">(pause 00:27:38-00:27:51) Do you think that's right, to drop me a line, or like he just wants to show he doesn't give a shit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Is that something you feel I should know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: No, I just feel like... I just assumed he does give a shit, and I would say that and maybe he would say, \"You know, maybe there is another perspective.\" (chuckles). Instead of assuming the worst. (pause) [00:28:29-00:00:29:00] I'm sorry; I'm so distracted today.

It's not that I don't like it, I just feel like... I don't know, you know... (chuckles) I guess I'm trying to deny that there is a problem there, or, you know, something that I can't change or help or don't want to. Probably I don't want to... I have thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">about living with her, because then that would make it feel a little less like (ph anger) and then we have (inaudible at 00:30:11) into it... Because I'm nervous... you don't like... I could clean that up (sweeping), but I don't...

There is more price to pay, there is more of a sacrifice than just money if you lived with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, you mean sacrificing my time and freedom and independence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: But you already feel your sacrifice and, I think, to some extent because you're not able to have the option of paying, of having your own place because you have to pay her rent, there was already some sacrifice of freedom, even the freedom to choose, even if you didn't choose that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean...

(pause) If I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">to live by myself, I could and I know if I need a part-time job... but I don't know if I want to live by myself, or if (inaudible 00:32:46). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">And who knows?

There's an investment, there is a deep emotional investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'd like to think that I'm good at something, you know, right away (chuckles)... And I would be a good burdened daughter, you know, that's... that's gratification very quickly. We have... I guess burdens ground you, you know? It's like a big weight on you, you can't move. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">(chuckles) But they also give you, like a position, like orient you. This is something I do, you know, so... it defines me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: The way you said \"burdens ground you\" reminds me of our discussion about being stuck; how \"stuckness\" grounds you, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I guess I'd stopped thinking of him that way... without realizing it. But it was in the back of my mind, kind of, like never... maybe I do have to (inaudible 00:36:18), like, if I did, I'd forgot it.

(pause) I guess it could be, if it goes out of proportion too much, but... (pause) I just become this, you know? Like, for a long time.

No one, people don't live with their parents, at least in this country, you know, at this age, like an adult. (pause) Yeah, also like my professors from (ph MSU), they also work. That's what they ask me, when they (chuckles), when I let them, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: What do they ask you?

That was what I was confused about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">CLIENT: Well, just because, like... you know, like, financial aid or whatever, like when that question comes up, you know, you have to say, \"No, I can't do this, I can't (ph hold) this\" because, you know, I have to support my mom.
