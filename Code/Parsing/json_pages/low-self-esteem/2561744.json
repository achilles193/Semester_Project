Never had a beard. On this side, there\u2019s a little spot here that doesn\u2019t grow quite like this side. But of course my Assyrian friends are like \u201cOh, you just trim this side little bit, trim it, like this\u201d. So, I figured out the loan thing, I think. I still have not heard <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">back from this company. Can you believe that shit? I put together a whole \u2013 I was like \u201chere\u2019s a photo of the letter, here\u2019s the e-mail response from your douchebag employees, telling me all this stuff\u201d \u2013 didn\u2019t hear back. And, mind you, not just to customer service, I got the personal business e-mails <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">of the regional managers. So it\u2019s like, wow. One of you can\u2019t even respond? The good news is, the Department of Education finally got back to me. Because I was worried, why is the Department of Education not getting back to me? They sent me a really good e-mail today that really broke it down. It still <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">doesn\u2019t excuse the company, by the way, but when I consolidated, the one thing they do that I don\u2019t think is cool is that it\u2019s up to you to list your loans. Like, they don\u2019t go into their database and see \u201cOkay, let\u2019s look at all his loans\u201d. For whatever reason, they don\u2019t do that. They just go on what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200234\">you\u2019re telling them. Weird, right? The fucking Department of Education. So when you\u2019re looking at your NLDS, when you look at that database that tells you all your loans, it\u2019s just kind of confusing. And then when you\u2019ve got to match that with the things they ask you on the application, it\u2019s \u2013 so somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200235\">I didn\u2019t list three or four of my loans. Or I mis-listed \u2013 I don\u2019t know what I did. Those are the ones that then defaulted, and then were sent to the company. Now, I\u2019m not even going to get into questions like why didn\u2019t the Department of Education tell me that those were going \u2013 I\u2019ve received nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200236\">from nowhere, but I look online, and they have my records, they know where I live. But they were cool; they were like \u201cYou can just consolidate those\u201d. So unfortunately I do that application again for those, but, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So some of them got consolidated and some of them didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: All the rest are. There\u2019s like, three or four loans that aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a little confusing, I\u2019m not sure I totally get it, because I went online to look at all of my loans, and there are like six \u2013 not different loans, but six that are from like, two or three different places. Those are the ones <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">that are listed as defaulted. So I\u2019ll just take those and just, you know. But I cannot believe, I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: So, how about the ones that got consolidated that you still hadn\u2019t heard anything? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Oh those. So those, I went online to that database. They all say \u201cZero balance, zero payment due.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561744\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t make any sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: That doesn\u2019t make any sense. I don\u2019t know if they I\u2019m going to, that\u2019s the next. I just want to take care of this, and then \u2026 Because when I saw that it said zero, I was just like, \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d I\u2019m going to call them about this, but now I see that it says \u201czero due\u201d, still, that\u2019s the most up-to-date <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">information, so I think when I respond to them about this, I\u2019ll just say, \u201cLook, the ones that you did consolidate\u2014\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Haven\u2019t heard anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Do you know, is this that you know that I\u2019m unemployed, and there\u2019s something that kicks in that \u2013 I just don\u2019t know. So anyway, it\u2019s a headache, but it\u2019s getting done, you know? That made me feel a lot better. Not hearing at all is like \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d And it also made me feel a lot better <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">because I thought about that when I left, just \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I fucking call them, to see if I owe them something\u201d. So at least now I feel like, okay. For whatever reason, it says that no payments are due right now. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: But you still will call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah yeah. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something, maybe when I consolidated, maybe there was something where maybe you get a grace period; there must be something like that. Because that was the whole point, I was like, I\u2019m unemployed, or way underemployed or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: So it could be six months interest free -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Something like that. Like, something\u2019s accruing maybe, but I don\u2019t have to pay it, who the fuck knows. Because I know that I get shit from the Department of Education. That\u2019s how I consolidated. They send you things in the mail. That makes me feel kind of better. It makes me feel a lot better, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">actually. One way or the other I\u2019m not going to be in default.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s huge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t get why they don\u2019t have a way to just check all your loans when you\u2019re applying. That\u2019s what a consolidation is. Whatever I have, just fucking do it, but that\u2019s okay. Paid the rent. Somehow \u2013 I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m proud. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m doing it. Somehow. Remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">how I said I might have to ask my friend? Somehow it\u2019s getting done. I might have like, fifty bucks left by Friday, because my car insurance also comes out usually the first week of every month, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s somehow getting done. Looking into the reverse mortgage for my mom. So, yeah. It\u2019s a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: And your uncle?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, we\u2019re going to \u2013 oh, did I tell you about my business plan? Shit. I should have brought a copy in for you. Damn it. So I got that. Yeah. It\u2019s all finished, it\u2019s like fifteen pages, and it was actually \u2013 it wasn\u2019t easy, but the SBA has a really good, not just a template, but you just plug <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">it in <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Oh, did I? I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: No, that\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so, I did that. My uncle\u2019s been really sick, so. And my aunt, finally the wacky aunt\u2019s here from Portsmouth. So my mom\u2019s trying to find the right \u2013 I think my uncle\u2019s really helping that. The poor guy is like, I think he\u2019s \u2013 the son now works for him and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">pressure my uncle to help him buy a house. My uncle\u2019s in a weird place. Those guys are \u2013 I never thought this would happen, especially to that family, but right now my mom and I are the most together in this whole \u2013 the most, not together, the most healthy, I guess? My other cousins, they have money, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">they\u2019re doing much, much better now, my uncle is doing \u2013 but they have internal, they have issues. So it\u2019s weird. Of all the \u2013 you know. So we\u2019re going to talk to him, but we\u2019re trying not to. If this reverse mortgage thing makes sense, I\u2019d rather not burden him. My mom told me that he told her in private <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B3\">that he\u2019s going to pay for her car payments. It\u2019s so awesome, it\u2019s very sweet, but I\u2019m so embarrassed by those things; that he has to do that. And my mom didn\u2019t say it to make me feel bad, she was just saying, you know, he\u2019s <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561744\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s already doing something, doing so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m also trying \u2013 I don\u2019t want to know \u2013 because, you know, they\u2019re sisters?

I don\u2019t want to. Let him buy Bobby ten houses. I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">get into that mindset of \u2013 the guy basically gave me thirty thousand dollars to go to school. He\u2019s been there for me too, he\u2019s been there for people, he\u2019s doing his fucking best. When they all get together, I don\u2019t like that womanly \u2013 they start getting a little\u2026 what\u2019s the word? Keeping tally. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">want to get involved with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">[Pause from 00:10:02 to 00:10:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what the point of any of that is.

Old drunk dudes, you know? As I\u2019m passing one of them, this old dude <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">goes, you know I\u2019m walking, and he just looks at me, and goes, \u201cHey, you got boobs!\u201d Now normally, this is why I love this story, because normally, that would put me in a fucking tailspin. You don\u2019t tell someone who has vanity, narcissism issues\u2026 so without missing a fucking beat, without even breaking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">my stride, I just said \u201cYou do too, buddy!\u201d and just kept walking. And he got so \u2013 he was like \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t have -\u201d He was like this fat old dude. But I just had to laugh. Of course I have to get a random insult. That\u2019s just how it\u2019s been, the last few months. Might as well. Un-fucking-believable. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200573\">[Laughter] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: You almost have to laugh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You almost have to laugh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well it is funny, a fat drunk dude telling me \u2013 but on some level, it does \u2013 I don\u2019t have one of those total flat indie-rock chests that some dudes have.

If you\u2019re someone that\u2019s generally a little more not like that, then sure, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">you can just make fun of yourself and just move along. But if you\u2019re someone that\u2019s already like, so hard on yourself, it\u2019s like, unrelenting, then that\u2019s not going to work. Because then you\u2019re going to dwell on that. Do you know what I mean? Then you\u2019re going to be like \u201cWhy the fuck did I make fun <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">of -\u201d you know. So that felt fantastic. And I didn\u2019t think about it. It just came out of my mouth, I didn\u2019t even stop, I just kept right on going. That was just it. Yeah, it was cool. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: And you didn\u2019t dwell as much on this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t dwell as much, no, I didn\u2019t like, go and look in the mirror or whatever. I mean, you know. It is what it is. I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m very \u2013 obviously I\u2019m vain, and that does bother me, I do notice \u2013 I wish that I was more, totally just a flat thing, some dudes are just flat, there\u2019s nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">there. I\u2019m not like that. But at the same time, that\u2019s neither here nor there. It doesn\u2019t mean you have boobs, it just means you have definition, or a certain \u2013 you know what I mean? Contours or whatever. What the fuck. So yeah, I don\u2019t know. So I think it was a much healthier \u2013 you know. Ultimately <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D2\">it was about just realizing the absurdity \u2013 I mean a fat old dude is not going to get me down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Or that he could find something about any person walking by him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: That was the other thing. If he said something to someone else \u2013 you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: As a way to do something for his own ego.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Right.

What? I don\u2019t \u2013 what? What are you talking about?\u201d Unbelievable. But at the same time it was like, well, of course. It\u2019s not bothering me like it would, but man, wow. Getting hurled insults by drunk people on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">the street. Drunk old people on the street. Not even, like, a frat jock or something, you know?

It\u2019s great \u2013 I\u2019m thinking about that now \u2013 it\u2019s awesome how that\u2019s been\u2026 I\u2019ve really been able to diffuse\u2026 it\u2019s like dismantling a bomb. I don\u2019t remember anything she\u2019s said lately, because she\u2019s been so much better.

And when I leave and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D2\">I go to my apartment, I\u2019ve forgotten all about it. And I think that\u2019s a healthier\u2026 because a lot of people have parents like that, or whatever, a lot of people have wacky dynamics with their parents. But that\u2019s the key is that hopefully they find a way, you know, it bothers them maybe in that second, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D3\">but then they find a way to \u2013 it it\u2019s not who they are, it doesn\u2019t define anything, you know?

If it was me now, I would have thought very differently about that situation. Someone that was so beautiful, and so cool, and so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">into me and so nice, and also, let\u2019s face it \u2013 I\u2019m realizing now, now I understand guys, and women, who are like, you don\u2019t need to be rich, whatever. But I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s nice if someone is totally together on that front, that\u2019s awesome.

Like a wuss, or needy or something, you know? It\u2019s like, naah. I\u2019ve been so good about not being that way, you know? I mean, not that I ever really was that way, but not having those moments where you\u2019re just kind of texting someone, or wanting to somehow connect with that person again, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD2\">like, dude, there\u2019s nothing to connect. Not to mention, I get upset, because I\u2019m not an idiot, there are also reasons why I am not with them \u2013 you know? Like, it\u2019s that, yes, maybe it could have been great, whatever, but the fact is, there was something, back then, that made me not want to see this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD3\">person all the time, you know.

You know what I mean? Like, I just can\u2019t \u2013 you know what I\u2019m saying? I\u2019m like, yeah, there were reasons why <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">I kind of broke up with these people, but I was also fucked up. Like, what\u2019s going on? Why am I so\u2026 or why am I even so caught up in this, you know what I mean? People have breakups all the time. It does suck. Whatever. But Robin, that was almost ten years ago.

It\u2019s waking up confused, coming out of a coma, the waters, that metaphor of the water, the storm settling down, and you get to actually see what was beneath the surface. I mean, it\u2019s a totally different set of eyes you have toward yourself, and even toward other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">and toward relationships from the past. I think it\u2019s unavoidable, to not have tremendous grief, or longing, or wishes, or fantasies or wonderings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think part of it is that you almost want \u2013 one some level you just want that person to know how different you are now; you know what I\u2019m saying? I was kind of cleaning out my e-mail, and I found \u2013 between that and applying to different universities I was like \u201cOh, shit. What about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">the woman at UConn who hired me?\u201d Then it was all, it kind of ended badly and all that, remember that? I was like, \u201cYou know what?

I should have immediately been like, I\u2019ve got nothing to say about resumes, and fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E32\">business writing \u2013 for that long, I\u2019ve got nothing to say about it. I have nothing to say about it for fifteen minutes, but I can bullshit. But three and a half fucking hours, to MBA students. What is there to talk about? I mean, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just a dumb <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So it was about resumes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Business writing. How, what could you \u2013 you know what I mean? What is there to \u2013 there\u2019s a textbook and all this shit. What the fuck is there to talk about? They\u2019re not children. So I should have just, if I knew myself the way I know now, yeah I could use the money, but\u2026 But again I got caught <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">up, \u201cOh, they\u2019re asking me to teach more at UConn\u201d. You know what I mean? So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And your relationship with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Well I got busted. With the morning class, you know, some of the students complained, or they must have. Something must have happened. She ended up knowing that I\u2019d missed, you know. And yeah, it was just all awkward and awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Knowing that you\u2019d cancelled class, or? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, she was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d you know, whatever. And I don\u2019t remember what I said, I think I tried to make up a white lie or something, I was just so embarrassed. She wasn\u2019t mean at all, she was kind of more, like, surprised, and said \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you just talk to me, or tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">me that there\u2019s any issue\u201d. You know. But even that. It\u2019s almost like letting these people know that man, dude, honestly, you don\u2019t know what, like you don\u2019t know how asleep I was back then. You don\u2019t get it, you know what I mean? So just to let them know that things are very, very different now, just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF2\">for what it\u2019s worth, you know what I mean? It\u2019s not like, \u201cBe my friend,\u201d or whatever. Just, for what it\u2019s worth. You know. So yeah, that\u2019s a tough one. I\u2019m having \u2013 it\u2019s not depressing me, but it\u2019s definitely, like, sad, and melancholy. It\u2019s popping up in my \u2013 that\u2019s why I think I\u2019m having dreams with <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF3\">like, women in them. I think it\u2019s just\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: More dreams?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been having more, yeah. At this point I can\u2019t even keep track of, yeah. There\u2019s a lot of dreams about \u2013 there\u2019s just themes now, about, you know, either I\u2019m lost, or trying to get somewhere, people, trying to sort things out with people, trying to explain or whatever. There was one, I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">drive. Another one, one of those things where it\u2019s like, all slow, and I can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m driving, but I\u2019m like, sleeping, so a cop pulls me over or something, or I hit a tree or some shit like that. So yeah. It\u2019s a combination of, like, stress dreams or whatever, but also I think it\u2019s all this trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F32\">work out of, trying to get somewhere, you know what I mean? Things are in, a lot of transformation is going on and stuff, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561744\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: I wonder if there\u2019s been a revival of that \u2013 the driving dream. Because you\u2019ve had those a lot before, in the past, where you\u2019re stuck falling asleep, or slowed down, or just around the stuff about the loans, like that\u2019s critical \u2013 things are going okay, and then this hits you and it feels like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: It could be the loan, I think it\u2019s everything. I think, on some level that is strictly, just, like, a PTSI mean, I got arrested twice. You know. First time I thought it was over, then they bust into my house and drag me away. I mean, that\u2019s, you know, I\u2019m scared of that shit, you know. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">I think, as usual, I kind of just stoically went through it. That\u2019s like another just \u2013 I can tick it off on my list of things, \u201cOh, yeah, whatever, I was arrested, shackled, and put into a\u2014\u201d Like, what? What the fuck? Are you kidding me? I mean, that\u2019s\u2026 you know. It happens, it\u2019s not like they just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F72\">came for me. It\u2019s not a world against me kind of thing. But whoever it\u2019s happened to, who clearly is not a criminal, clearly there\u2019s some misunderstanding, that\u2019s \u2013 it stays with you. It really stays with you. Because it happens now. Now, even if I have one drink, two drinks, I know I\u2019m totally fine, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F73\">whatever, but I do find myself getting very stiff, when I\u2019m driving back home, getting hyper, you know. It\u2019s like your mind plays tricks on you. You\u2019re like \u201cAm I swerving? Am I in the lane?\u201d You know? It\u2019s like, just, you\u2019re petrified. Fucking petrified.  The registration thing \u2013 fuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Which? What\u2019s the registration thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: My car got towed. That was a state trooper. I was fucked. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how I got away with \u2013 I mean, that could have been really bad. Or not, I mean, I wasn\u2019t drunk, but it doesn\u2019t matter. If they decide, they\u2019re going to make you do all those tests or whatever, and if they have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB1\">any suspicion, and you\u2019re scared and fucking nervous, and you\u2019re stammering, or you\u2019re just whatever, you know, they can push you, and they have, they can just arrest you, or they can just \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry I think you\u2019re drunk.\u201d Whatever. Are you going to do the breathalyzer? No? Well okay, fine. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB2\">know? It could just be a fucking nightmare. So I think sometimes, combined with all this other shit, I\u2019m sure that has something to do with it, that fear of \u2013 I get scared late at night, I don\u2019t get scared but I do \u2013 it\u2019s really dissipated now. But I won\u2019t lie, you know, when I hear cops, or I see the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB3\">blue lights suddenly flashing, like the shadow or whatever, it makes me pause, you know what I mean? On top of, then, the fucking terrorist bullshit. I\u2019m sure a lot of people in Cheshire \u2013 every time you fucking hear weird noises, or, you know. So. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: On top of the trauma of losing your dad, and all the slowing down of yourself and freezing yourself that happened then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s utter powerlessness. That\u2019s the thing, I think. If more people got arrested, more people that shouldn\u2019t be arrested, I think the criminal justice system would be very different. When you\u2019re in that situation where there isn\u2019t a goddamn thing you can do \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how innocent <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF1\">you are, you\u2019re a great person, you just forgot to pay your fine, you\u2019re going to take care of it, you\u2019ll pay it now, it doesn\u2019t matter. When they\u2019re doing things by the books, you are the accused, and they are the law. I mean that\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know.

So it looks like I\u2019m down to two programs; UConn and Mystic. Mystic has a \u2013 I think theirs is like an MA in counseling, or MS in counseling, mental health \u2013 I don\u2019t know, something like that. What\u2019s the ethics of, like, it\u2019s okay for me to say, you know, \u201cI\u2019ve been in psychoanalysis <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">for a long time, other than bettering myself, and whatever.\u201d Is it okay to talk about these things? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: You mean on an application?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, is it like, a personal statement, or?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">CLIENT: Their whole thing is, like, you know, what\u2019s driving you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I think that\u2019s \u2013 people include that kind of thing on college applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s pretty important, if not the most important thing I have to say, so. Now, this is really a na\u00efve question, but, therapists don\u2019t write letters for their patients, do they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">THERAPIST: To apply for things? No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah, because that\u2019s like a confidentiality thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: Right, okay. Just wondering. Okay. Yeah, it just crossed my mind, because they\u2019re like \u201cYou know, you should have some social science courses, or some kind of background in something\u201d. I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve been in Claire University for fucking ten years\u201d. But okay, so I can tell them that I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201171\">been doing this? Okay, cool. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">CLIENT: Those are the only programs that are around here that are do-able, you know. The one thing I like about Mystic maybe a little bit more than UConn, is that it\u2019s a rolling admission, so I can get started faster. I don\u2019t know. The best thing I can do, I think, is to talk to faculty in both, just <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B1\">go meet with them, or just sit and just chat, but. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">THERAPIST: You can do that, maybe meet with Admissions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2019m really good about, like, just finding faculty, and just, you know. Like, there was someone at UConn, her response was a little curt. She\u2019s in the clinical, she\u2019s a professor, and she does things in, like, identity, and minority, kind of stuff. But when she wrote back \u2013 I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F1\">get the UConn thing. I said \u201cThis MS blah blah blah blah blah program,\u201d and she said \u201cWe don\u2019t offer an MS. You might be talking about the online MS.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, are those different professors?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s probably a different program. Maybe in a different department.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: Oh, I see. Huh. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: These are all things you\u2019re going to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s good to know.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20149\">THERAPIST: Or, social work is also a terminal degree, it\u2019s a little longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014B\">CLIENT: Right. Right. Yeah, because my feeling is, I probably wouldn\u2019t sit for the exam. It\u2019s for the coaching, you know. But just having it is more than enough. Although I could -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Why would you not sit for the exam?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah, why would you not sit \u2013 of course I would. I\u2019m just saying in the meantime, that\u2019s the important thing. For the business, that would be huge, huge.
