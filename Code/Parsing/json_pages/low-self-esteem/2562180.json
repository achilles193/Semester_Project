People were just ignoring traffic lights and it was backed up and gridlocked for about 15 minutes just to get from that and turn to the next street. A (inaudible at 00:00:25) was going the wrong way down the street. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">He had diplomatic plates, too. I don\u2019t even know. That\u2019s dangerous; diplomatic plates; I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I had forgotten to mention yesterday, but wanted to remember to mention today, I moved over billing stuff over the weekend, which I usually do at the beginning of the month. But I also hadn\u2019t looked over stuff for you in a while, so I wanted to see where we were at.  I guess there are really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">two things. One is it looks like your insurance did go down to just paying for once a week starting towards the end of November. I also did a quick run-through because on one side of it there is that, and there is your deductible, and on the other side there is the fact that you were $5 ahead for most <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">of the visits last year. Then there was a point at which you probably hit an out-of-pocket max and your insurance covered everything; and you\u2019re also doing the recording. Anyway, I looked through it fairly quickly, but we wound up within like $50 of each other or something; so I wasn\u2019t too concerned <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">about that. I should probably look at it a little bit more carefully. Basically, I think we\u2019re pretty close to even. I\u2019ll figure it out at some point, but the other thing was it looks like at the end of sometime in November, they actually did go down to paying for once a week. They had sort of said <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F4\">they would do it over the summer, but never really did enter it until then. I just wanted to let you know.  They should have been sending you these about that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I\u2019m bad at paying attention to those. Thanks for letting me know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Sure. (pause) What\u2019s on your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: My birthday is Tuesday and I planned a party for Saturday. I e-mailed about it and the first six people to RSVP said they couldn\u2019t come.  I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of tough to argue with \u201cit\u2019s my wedding anniversary and my wife and I are going to Vermont for the weekend\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s my daughter\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">birthday and she\u2019s home for spring break so I\u2019m spending it with her\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m out of town on a trip I booked months ago\u201d or whatever. I am kind of feeling down about it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve mentioned, but birthdays are kind of rough for me because it\u2019s so rare that I have a good one. My 21st birthday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">my housemate and person who I had thought was a friend, deliberately scheduled a surprise party for her boyfriend on the same day that I had planned my 21st birthday party.  His birthday and my birthday were close, but I\u2019m fairly certain she did it on purpose and then she very explicitly told me I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">not welcome to come. And so everyone went to his party instead of mine. There was literally no one at my 21st birthday party. It sucked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">There was one year when my parents just completely flaked on planning a birthday party for me. I was seven or eight and they finally had planned a party for me in July and no one showed up because it was summer and no one goes to kids\u2019 birthday parties in the summer because they\u2019re on summer vacation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">And everyone made fun of me for the entire next year that my parents forgot my birthday for four months. I don\u2019t think they forgot, I think they just are bad at planning things; but that\u2019s how it got told around the school.  (pause) So now I feel kind of like a chump for even trying to have a birthday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">party because why would I expect anyone to come celebrate my birthday? I\u2019m not important; clearly not a priority for any of my friends. (pause) I kind of hate that I\u2019m still thinking about Thomas all the time, but there is a part of me that really wants to know whether he would have showed up if we <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">were still dating because it\u2019s not like he ever came to any of the other events I invited him to when we were dating.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562180\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: What else is coming to mind? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: Last night I kind of had a meltdown about birthday stuff after choir rehearsal. Dave lost his temper at me and told me that I had no right to complain that people weren\u2019t coming to my birthday party and that I should grow up and understand that other people have their own commitments and priorities <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">and stuff going on in their lives.  I feel really guilty because I\u2019m sure Dave thought that once I left Harvard and was no longer in that pressure cooker, that some of the depression and mental health stuff would lift, and it hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s been ten years and things are still really bad inside my head. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">He\u2019s sick of dealing with me and my neuroses. I don\u2019t know. I kind of feel like it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m not better yet.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s neurotic to be upset that the first responses to the invitation you sent out from people who couldn\u2019t come, even if for reasons that, in a way, aren\u2019t personal ones related to you, especially in light of the history you\u2019re telling me about to birthdays.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">neurotic. (long pause)  You mentioned that you are kind of afraid of feeling or being in touch with how sad you feel about it because, in a way, I think [you might just begin to see it as your fault.] (ph?) (pause)  [Maybe I\u2019d, in a way, come to use the occasion of your being sad as a kind of entr\u00e9e <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">to be cruel.] (ph?) I don\u2019t think you actually think I would do that, but in probably a general way you are afraid of that. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Then Dave told me that if parties were this upsetting to me, maybe I just shouldn\u2019t have birthday parties anymore, which came across as sounding like I\u2019m not allowed to have parties or I don\u2019t deserve to have parties because I\u2019m too crazy to. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not what he meant, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s how it felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Like my punishment for being crazy is that I don\u2019t get parties anymore. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s kind of complicated. I think there are a few key things involved in the way you are being so critical and hateful towards yourself now. I think, in part, you want me to reassure you and I think, in part, it\u2019s so much safer if I\u2019m the one who is sympathetic to you, as compared <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">to you being sympathetic. (long pause)  You seem to have shut down.
