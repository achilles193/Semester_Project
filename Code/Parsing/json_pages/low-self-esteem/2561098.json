Come on in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Did you have a nice Thanksgiving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I did, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I had an eventful Thanksgiving. I got into a fight, like with a friend. Well, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s a friend anymore or was. She\u2019s part of my women\u2019s group and I\u2019ve only known her for the past few months \u2013 maybe a year or something like that. No longer than a year. She\u2019s kind of like, she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">loud and like is very social but is very like on the surface and I don\u2019t really \u2013 how may I characterize \u2013 like she always says these like stock thank you e-mails and then you spend time with her and like do something and she\u2019s like, \u2018thank you for the\u2019 you know very, very standard like a machine wrote <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">it. She mostly coordinates the stuff that we do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">But for my class we\u2019re launching a literary magazine and I wanted her to write an essay about (unclear) identity and stuff because she wrote for like three different continents. So I gave her like a four week notice and she was very enthusiastic and she said she\u2019d love to do it and then I guess the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">deadline got closer I was like, \u2018hey, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 And she said, \u2018when\u2019s the deadline?\u2019 And I said, \u2018next week.\u2019 So she was like, \u2018oh, I don\u2019t know if I can do it right now but I will send you some e-mails I wrote when I was in South Africa.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, okay, maybe I can help you with that. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">I found a few things that I liked and I told her to expand on it and gave her questions and then she was like after a few days, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do it. Can you just come and interview me?\u2019 So I was a little upset because to me a publication is a big deal or you know, you\u2019re supposed to do this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">work on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But still, it was something that I wanted so I like put it aside and went and interviewed her and when I was writing and I was like this is actually cool. This is actually a very cool piece. And that day, Thanksgiving Day, we had like a party at this guy\u2019s place who is a friend of Nelson (sp?). But <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">I met these people through her. I met Nelson (sp?) through her so I was (unclear) asking is it okay if I\u2019m there and we\u2019re both there because it might be weird and (unclear) said no, you go and so I was enjoying the time until she came and she hugged everyone but me. So I was like okay, a little weird. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">And I think was when Dr. (unclear) thinks she\u2019s listening and then like at some point she came to me and said, \u2018so do send me the profile before you send it to the printers okay?\u2019 And I was like really pissed by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So I was a little aggressive. I said, \u2018yeah, I wrote it even though I was really stressed with so many other things to do but I still wrote it. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll still send it to you before I send it to the printers because I have high standards and this is standard procedure.\u2019 So then like a minute <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">later she turned to me shaking, and she said, \u2018you know what? Don\u2019t write it. Don\u2019t send it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018whoa, you know. You totally took it the wrong way.\u2019 And I know you have high standards. Just don\u2019t do it. And I was like chasing her around the room like trying to talk to her like I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">\u2018let\u2019s step outside and talk.\u2019 Like, \u2018let\u2019s resolve this.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018I don\u2019t need to step outside. You need to step outside.\u2019 So I got really shaken up, you know, because all of a sudden I was like, \u2018wait a second, I don\u2019t know any of these people. I\u2019ve only met them three or four times and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">like some of them were actually really, really nice and you know, I feel kind of close to them for whatever reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561098\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">But Nelson (sp?) was not there at the party at that time so like \u2013 he\u2019d stepped out for something, so I just wanted to get up and leave but one of the people that I met that day, she was like, \u2018no I\u2019ll take a walk with you. Don\u2019t leave. Wait for him.\u2019 So we took a walk and then when Nelson came back <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">he and I stepped outside and he took me to this place and we were talking for a long time and then he went back and joined them for the party. I just felt like for all night crying. I just felt really weird you know. And then the next morning \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Crying about -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Just that exchange was very \u2013 it shook me up because I felt really scared I\u2019d done something wrong by being a little aggressive with her, being rude to her and the way that she told me off. I got really scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Scared that what would happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Like, \u2018oh God, what have I done?\u2019 She seemed very powerful at that time and I felt very weak. I felt very out of it and unstable and she felt very powerful. And like the whole outsider thing really kicked in and I felt like I don\u2019t belong here and I\u2019ll never be able to make women friends and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">that\u2019s what I need. If I had that I wouldn\u2019t have so many guy friends and potentially like sleep with them. So I walked \u2013 I walked to Chris\u2019s place and everything seemed really strange because I saw my name on the mailbox and like yeah, this was like I\u2019m always hopping in and out of circles. I hoped <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">out of Chris\u2019s circle for various reasons because I felt judged, I felt small, you know. And that thing happened with his advisor in India, you know. That can shake anyone up and cause them to leave circles but you know I felt like I\u2019m always running away or getting scared or just feeling small. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">at that time I was really like, I guess that\u2019s what I was telling them at the \u2013 everyone has their shit together, everyone is working and they have nice jobs and they\u2019re saving money and they\u2019re secure and they have parents and siblings like that whole apparatus to lean back on. I just completely feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200234\">indefinite. I felt very indefinite, I guess, that night and the next day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: What was it specifically that you said to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I said, \u2018yes, I am writing it.\u2019 And we only had two or three days to do it. So we\u2019re sending the contents like right now, this morning. And I interviewed her Wednesday. And I have lots of other things to do. I have a paper due tomorrow but I was thinking liking what am I doing and I was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">panicking and really pissed that she didn\u2019t write the essay, nor had she done any thinking. So I had to like tease it out of her and like I was kind of like (unclear), \u2018yeah, we\u2019re going to dinner,\u2019 we\u2019re doing this, she\u2019s going to parties.\u2019 So you know, looking at her Facebook activity also I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">\u2018okay, you have time to party but you can\u2019t sit down for an hour and write.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Why were you in her Facebook?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think I was on her Facebook. You know you get news feeds and you see her saying things like, \u2018we went out dancing,\u2019 and whatnot. I was not like on her page but I was just looking at her news feed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561098\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think I have time to stalk her or anything. But yeah, I was kind of pissed that she didn\u2019t think this was important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">(PAUSE): [00:10:21 \u2013 00:10:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: So what was your question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I asked you what you said to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, so I had very little time to adjust so I just kind of said that \u2018yeah I have a lot going on but still I\u2019m writing it and don\u2019t worry, I will send it to you. I have very high standards. I do this every day. I know that\u2019s the thing to be done.\u2019 So I just was like feeling weird as though <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">I don\u2019t know to do that. So, I do this for my work at the university like writing profiles and interviewing people and you have to send it to everyone you mentioned in the article before you print it, you know? So I felt ignored by her and then like spoken to like I don\u2019t know my own shit and you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">\u2013 I guess I was feeling insecure other than just her because this was a new circle and I didn\u2019t know anyone and everyone knows everyone else and like for a long time so that also added up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: So why provoke her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: What do you mean? Provoke her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Why say something that she could react to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess I was angry with her. I felt let down and angry and unappreciated and just not the center of attention after she came in. Wait \u2013 I don\u2019t think I was the center of attention. I was actually, everyone was in the living room and I was actually in the kitchen cooking. So I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">do that a lot. I\u2019ve done that in the past also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe we can help you do something else with those feelings when you\u2019re having them. Because when you\u2019re lashing out at people and then they take a stand back at you and then you just start really freaking out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: And it really (unclear) this cascade of a bad few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: It reminds me of your experience at your women\u2019s group a few weeks ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That was small but this was big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You were upset about that too, though. You wanted to send apologies. It was like an aftermath to that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. What can you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like you get confused because your feelings and their intentions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) What do you mean \u201ctheir intentions\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, I mean it sounds as though she was kind of blowing it off. Whether she was blowing you, personally, off because she feels you are inferior to her \u2013 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s possible. But, you know, whatever. She\u2019s not taking this seriously. But it goes somewhere very personal in you. Very deeply personal. It feels like a personal affront to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it does. It does. I can\u2019t see it any other way. Like Chris tells me all the time \u2013 look, number one rule \u2013 people are not thinking about you. They\u2019re just caught up in their own thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s too insensitive. Why aren\u2019t they thinking about me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not that nobody thinks about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I made it personal. I did send her an e-mail like 5 in the morning Friday, like a long e-mail saying like sorry, didn\u2019t mean to hurt you and like I was just confused by everything. I respect you enough to send you the thing for finalizing it and the whole point to do this was to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">get to know you and I feel like I\u2019ve tried hard to get to know you but you really haven\u2019t tried the same way which is fine. We don\u2019t have to have mutual feelings but let\u2019s make up because we have to be in the same women\u2019s group and etc. And she send like a one-liner and just basically copied my words <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">and said, \u2018yeah, let\u2019s be productive members of the group. So that really hurt. It was like you\u2019re not going to (unclear) other stuff about me trying to get to know you and you not trying to get to know me and so I don\u2019t know. I feel like it\u2019s my rough expectations maybe that I expected more from her <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200633\">and didn\u2019t get it for whatever reason. Maybe she doesn\u2019t even have that emotional level or if she does then she shares it with other people and not me and I cannot \u2013 I have to try really hard not to take that personally because I\u2019ve tried to be emotional and be available to her, you know? So it\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200634\">hard to understand and to accept it\u2019s not mutual.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561098\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">(PAUSE): [00:16:18 \u2013 00:16:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: But yeah, also the intent being like they don\u2019t intend to be personally attacking me or thinking anything personal about me. How do I deal with that? You tell me. Like there\u2019s five people in the room. She goes and like hugs or touches everyone except me? How am I supposed to feel about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: How do I feel okay about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Maybe she knows them better than she knows you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, she does or she hasn\u2019t seen them in a while. Yeah, that\u2019s true. Why can\u2019t I rise above like these petty things and just let them go? I think I can. It just depends on how vulnerable I am at that moment. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Well, you were angry with her. And so you\u2019re already having sort of a hostile relationship in your mind with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: And then that happens in the context of her not hugging you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: And then you start making all sorts of assumptions about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. Like Nelson (sp?) said. \u2018There\u2019s a time when you should get angry and if you\u2019re angry, do it properly. Don\u2019t be like all weird and shy about it.\u2019 And like being nasty to her in someone else\u2019s home at a party was not the place. If you were angry, you should have just kind of told <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">her face to face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(PAUSE): [00:18:02 \u2013 00:18:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: How far back do you have to go to understand why I was vulnerable like you know? Like what I did the previous day or the week, that whole week? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You can probably go further back than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Than a week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Sure because this keeps coming up with different people. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, like it was a new place, new people, they all make good money, some of them have PhDs. I don\u2019t know, something just snaps when the other person says, \u2018I just defended by thesis. I just finished <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">my PhD. I just found a post doc. To me that\u2019s just like as if they\u2019re saying, \u2018you\u2019re a loser. You haven\u2019t done anything. This is \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of ways to think about it but my first thought is this is a way in which you can identify with your father, that he felt very like put down in the world and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">he always had to puff himself up because he felt that people were sort of seeing him for less than or inferior and there\u2019s a way in which I feel like you identify with that part of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561098\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: I know, you told me \u2013 why would you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, but I mean he did some good things maybe, like for a few years when he had a job \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know that well. But I feel like I\u2019m trying to do as many things as \u2013 more things and trying to be responsible and he didn\u2019t even do that, you know\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I wasn\u2019t comparing you to him in that respect. I was simply comparing you to him in the respect of how he felt about himself and how he imagined other people felt about him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m trying to understand this because like if he felt low about himself I feel there were concrete reasons to feel that way, right? Because he didn\u2019t even really have a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a different \u2013 maybe that\u2019s true but I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not making the objective \u2018should he feel that way\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m more commenting on his experience. Maybe he felt badly about himself. It\u2019s still a different sort of thing than to translate that into feeling either inferior or superior to other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">people. People can have low self-esteem without having that element of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Maybe it was something I inherited from him but I do feel that I have that element that he did. Maybe I learned it from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Well, you certainly were exposed to it a lot. A history of chronic feeling an awareness of a hierarchy and a sense of feeling humiliated and also enraged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Unclear) you know? Yeah, when I feel humiliated and enraged \u2013 I don\u2019t like parties. Feeling exposed, completely. The next day I\u2019d gone to two parties. One was with Chris and my mom at this other guy\u2019s place \u2013 an older guy. We have events, cultural events with him, or political events. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">And there also I was talking to someone who had finished her PhD. I was fine at that time. I felt calm. She was sweet and she was telling me about her work and I was asking questions and then someone said, \u2018Victor might be coming to the party.\u2019 And I was like, what? So \u2013 but then thankfully, I had to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B2\">go to this other thing right after so I left. There for some reason I felt worried I guess because I didn\u2019t know that many people and I felt like I had to prove myself and to do that I had decided to cook for them which now I\u2019m like, was that an imposition because they already had made food. Why did <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B3\">I insist on cooking and even at their place? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">(PAUSE): [00:23:40 \u2013 00:23:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just felt like I had to prove myself and that I was in the kitchen cooking away from all the conversation. I mean I could hear them but I wasn\u2019t a part of the conversation. I was just listening to songs and laughing. But I was so aware of where everyone was and what everyone was doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">and felt like maybe objectively it\u2019s true that they are in a much better place financially and in terms of career and maybe emotionally as well and you know. And at that point it just becomes \u2013 it\u2019s all just a comparison to me like it\u2019s all like a graph, like they\u2019re high up there and I\u2019m like whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">I just want to just run away and not interact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And so they had food but you were also cooking?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561098\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: I think it was just really a miscommunication because I didn\u2019t really understand. This one guy said oh I\u2019ll make this one thing and I thought, that\u2019s all they\u2019re going to make? So maybe I should cook something to have more food. But I don\u2019t think it was that big a deal. They were fine. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">enjoyed it. (Pause) You\u2019re right. I do know people who are insecure but their insecurities somehow seem to come out in a very different way than mine do. Like I feel like they are much more stable and their behavior is just far more subdued. Their personalities are different but my experience of insecurities <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A32\">is humiliation and retaliation and rage and making a mess and involving as many people in the mess as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not so funny when it happens. It really leaves you feeling very distraught.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s not funny at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">(PAUSE): [00:26:18 \u2013 00:26:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I\u2019m still trying to think if there\u2019s any other thing that happened that riled me up that I could take care of, but I don\u2019t know. I mean I didn\u2019t work on my novel this week because I was so busy. I mean the last week, so that could have something to do with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">(PAUSE): [00:26:56 \u2013 00:27:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Maybe it\u2019s being too busy and not having time for myself maybe? I don\u2019t know. That sounds too minor though, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I think you get riled up real easily. I mean I think you\u2019re kind of primed for this so it doesn\u2019t take much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: What do you mean, primed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re kind of primed to have this experience of feeling slighted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: So I don\u2019t think it takes much. I mean there might be times in which you feel more vulnerable to it than others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: You mean I\u2019ll always have that and that\u2019s something to watch out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: No, I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t feel that way at all. I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ll always have it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m talking to you about it. If I didn\u2019t feel it would change I don\u2019t think there\u2019s be much use in talking to you about it. What I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s simply circumstantial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: So I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about like what happened this past week to get me feeling vulnerable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You could but I just think it\u2019s such an omnipresent experience for you, that\u2019s why what triggered it doesn\u2019t seem as important to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">(PAUSE): [00:28:35 \u2013 00:28:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just trying to think beyond everything beyond what happened, connecting one feeling to the next and what I thought was just that \u2013 I just always feel that everyone is better than me, you know. And like when two years ago that moment the constant thought for many weeks was that I hate myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">and yeah, I mean I thought I was trying to take care of that by doing things I liked and making a plan for getting what I want but I guess it\u2019s still there and like it surfaces from time to time.

It\u2019s like a lot of negative, like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: Some of those aren\u2019t true. You do have a career. Your career is maybe not where you want it to be at this moment. You have friends. Maybe you want different kinds of friends but you do have a lot of friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">CLIENT: I do. I should think more about what I have, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">THERAPIST: Maybe, but also you\u2019re putting in a box things you don\u2019t have that you actually do have. It\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t have a car but you actually do have a car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: But maybe you say it because you don\u2019t like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Maybe but then you have a car you don\u2019t like, not that you don\u2019t have one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. That\u2019s what it does to you. You deny, you deny what you have. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening with me. Like I hate the car I have. Or I\u2019m not invested in it. I just don\u2019t appreciate it. So it might as well be true that I don\u2019t have a car. Which is why I deny that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">I don\u2019t have friends like I have this idealized picture like I\u2019m supposed to be picking up the phone calling each other every day, every other day. We\u2019re supposed to hang out and have like a fixed meeting plan. Every Monday we have dinner together. I don\u2019t have that so I feel like I don\u2019t have friends. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D2\">It\u2019s a lot to do with like my idealized image of things, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">THERAPIST: It does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">CLIENT: I have to get more realistic about things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Your idealized image is that other people also have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that was a thing too like I was saying, that girl you met she was very insecure, \u2018like really?\u2019 You know, she has a gigantic family and she goes to India every so often. She seemed perfectly fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">(PAUSE): [00:42:43 00:44:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: How do those things go together? Because you also felt she didn\u2019t treat you well so how does her being perfectly fine and her not treating you well go together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: Oh no, that was someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah, sorry. Like I shut off many different possibilities and many different variations of things. Like reality can be so much more diverse and there are so many different combinations. It\u2019s so much richer than an idealized image.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s very true. That\u2019s very true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: I should appreciate that and think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: We should really be stopping for today. I\u2019ll see you on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Okay, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: Great. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
