I didn't want to come back. (chuckles) But here I am. (chuckles) I can't remember the last time we spoke or what we said. (chuckles) But it feels like it's been a lot longer because [I feel like a] (ph) different place. So I guess physically also because I'm moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I'm moving out of Hamden. (pause) But I've kind of forgotten how this works. (chuckles) Like am I supposed to talk or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it feels new all over again. It feels like it's new all over again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, huh. Well, I mean, I think it's a good thing. Yeah, I mean (pause) It's I'm trying to I feel differently about a lot of things, I guess. I've just kind of lost my sense of being here which I really actually like because that gives me a chance to start again, to start fresh <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">and feel really differently about myself. Well, maybe not myself, but like act differently. So, let's see. I'm back. I have almost moved out of Hamden. I'm in Arlington now. I'm not really sure how long I'm going to be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I did sign a one-year lease and I did, I guess I have started work full-time, but I actually just realized last night that I'm not going to do that. (chuckles) It's pretty bad. I just feel like my passion is just not going to get done if I work full-time. So I'm just figuring out my finances because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">my mom is living in a different apartment as well. So her rent plus my rent adds up to $2,000. [The rent of Chris's] (ph) helps me pay half of my mom's rent, then it comes around $1500 or $1450 or something, and if I get a part-time job, that will give me like $1500 a month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">So that would be cutting it pretty close, but I'll just have to do that, which means that I won't be able to do therapy (chuckles) because then I'll only have like 50 bucks left for, you know, food. I think I can try and do that instead of going back full-time, just because (pause) Yeah, I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">know. I feel like if I don't do this now, it will just never get done. Plus, you know, I'm starting school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: For?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Another degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: It will just give me deadlines and stuff because after MSU, I was just left with a very bad kind of understanding of writing and of what I could do with it. It was just not enough, that one-year program was just not enough and it prepared me -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">It completely changed my like it made me think that success in terms of success, it made me think that success was oh, just a few months away which is a very bad way of thinking long-term about [real art] (ph) and stuff. It just made me a very bitter person, I think. (chuckles) I mean, I'm not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">blaming the program. I'm just saying I did not learn the right lessons. And the people at this school seem a lot more friendlier and laid back. They measure success by just the quality of the time you're having while you work. (chuckles) I think that's more important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">I don't know. It's like when I was in Nepal, I just felt very differently about everything. It was hard because I was there with Chris (ph). I was living in his parents' house and they actually, both of them, his parents, mom and dad, took me aside and asked me about marriage. Just point-blank, \"When <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">are you guys going to -\" because we've been dating for seven years and they're like \"Okay, now, now, now.\" Now he has a job so they're like \"Okay, so now what's the hurdle?\" I kind of lied and said \"Well, Chris (ph) is not sure.\" At that time, he wasn't sure and I said \"He's interested in someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200392\">else.\" Well, I didn't actually say it that way. I said \"He might prefer someone else, not me, because I'm not as spiritual [or religious] (ph) and his mom was like \"No, you're perfect. I'm not going to accept anyone else now.\" She's like this bully, so I was very unhappy for a few days because Chris <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200393\">(ph) wasn't there and I was just with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559324\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">It was just me with his parents and they were just kind of building you know, praising him so much and talking about how beloved he is and all, and I was just so sick of it. (chuckles) I was just like, what is this thing that Nepalese parents have, this need to just really praise the male child <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">all the time? And his mom is just such a bully, like she micro-manages everything. I came out of the shower wearing a shirt for just like I wasn't even going to go out and I was just wearing it for a little bit. I might've changed into something else. She was like \"Your (inaudible at 00:06:44) is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">sticking out. Why are you wearing this? It's so short\" blah blah blah. And she completely controls my schedule. \"Now is the time to eat, come on\" and she's yelling all that and she's shouting at her husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I was just like so frustrated for those few days. I was just like, this is not going to work. Our personalities are very different and this and that. But then, you know, she was nice and we traveled and when I got back, she was nice nicer, I guess. And I was just thinking, you know, like that is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">what I want to do. I want to travel and meet people and eat and just talk, talk to new and interesting people. It just broadens your mind. It's so healing and it also keeps you alert and alive and interesting. I just hate my biggest fear is that I'll be staid and boring and not have interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">thoughts and not be interested in the larger world around me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">I feel like with a full-time job, that's what I will become. Just sitting behind a desk all day or just even being on the web is not the same thing as actually, you know, traveling in Nepal or talking to the rickshaw drivers or the people who have roadside stalls. That's kind of the work that Chris <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">(ph) does, or has done a little bit, and I'm just with him when he does it and I feel like I'm better at it than him. You know, like I'm really good at interviewing people for him and really good at establishing relationships with them, and I'm happiest when I do that. I mean, it's very hard, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">It's very hot, it's dirty, but you just get used to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">[00:8:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">I feel I can do that more like I can adjust with the shoddiness of the environment and rather than adjusting to the staidness of Cheshire, you know? (chuckles) I feel like maybe the time to make a decision about what I like and what I should do because I feel like mostly I'm unhappy because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">of not being able to do what I want to do and what makes me happy and where my talents are most used.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559324\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I think you're unhappy because there's something that feels really wrong on the inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And I don't that these things are ultimately going to make you happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: They may make you happy if other things happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: But I don't want to since you've come here to seek my professional opinion, that I don't know how these things that you feel that really make you feel terrible about yourself and these fantasies you have about how you could get better are going to change without some sort of intervention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And I would hate to see you sort of just run away in the hopes that something else will help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: It's true. (chuckles) Yeah, that's true. (pause) Yeah, I definitely see what you're saying. I feel like I mean, yeah, what you said about something on the inside that is wrong. I know what you're saying because even when I was in Nepal, I did have those dark moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">All it took was for Chris's (ph) mom to act crabby for a day and be a little harsh for me to feel terrible again. (chuckles) Or for me to see how much Chris (ph) is beloved. Again, I'm doing the same thing I always do when comparing and feeling bad that I cannot measure up and all. I know there's something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">on the inside that's wrong, but I also feel like if I'm productive, I feel a lot better about myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Because it's compensating.

(chuckles) Like what have I done that has only been temporary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well, like you know sort of getting sort of seeking out outside approval, affiliating with people who have these beautiful lives [so you can sort of be part of] (ph) that beautiful life rather than feeling that what's beautiful is inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: That they're sort of solutions to things that really end up in the end making you feel quite empty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's true.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Rather than someone who has sort of graduated and needing to create something for themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, like, see the thing is that I feel like I'm really at a crossroads at the moment. The same crossroads that I've always been at, maybe. (chuckles) Is it a beautiful house or a beautiful book? Really I see it as either\/or in the sense that right now, I could have a full-time job and, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">you know, save up money. And I wouldn't be saving up that much, maybe like a few thousand dollars a year, and it would slowly add up to where I could buy a house. Or I could quit my job and take the time it needs to work on my project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">I mean, I don't know. When I was in Nepal, this agent contacted me because I attended one of her workshops. In the workshop, we all had to show the first part of our project and a proposal and she could've helped us with that. So I guess she probably just contacted maybe everyone or maybe only those <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">people whose proposal pages she found were interesting. So, I mean, I'm not saying this is a big deal and like I should just completely change all my life based on this one e-mail or contact or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">But I do feel that I mean, I think this means that I just should give it as much of my time as I can and, you know, finish the project and then see what happens and if nothing, then I can go back to a full-time job. Not that it would just be waiting for me. (chuckles) But you know, like I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">do that a little later, you know? It's not about wanting to feel better about myself. I know I will still continue to be a bit of a mess, the same mess that I am, but this is just something I've wanted to do for almost 10 years now. So I should maybe now is the time because I have some savings and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF2\">I can probably scrounge around for part-time jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">I just feel like if I work full-time I just because you need like, you need those empty hours. You need to cogitate and think about the material and with a full-time job, you don't get that time because you only get bits and snippets, and you can probably just work during that time. I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">(chuckles) It's a big decision. It's a lot of money to give up, but I don't know. I just feel I want to be on vacation. (chuckles) It's probably a very irresponsible thing to want. (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559324\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">I don't know. (long pause) I mean, just because you feel small about yourself and you seek out people who are great and interesting I mean, I know that that is kind of a tendency when you're feeling low. But then that doesn't mean that you should stop hanging out with those people, right? (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">That you should stop associating with Chris (ph) like that's what I thought. Like I thought he's just too good or he's just too ambitious. He's just achieved too much, so I will always look very shabby next to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">So one solution is just not to stand next to him. You know, not to be in the position where I can be compared to him. But then I don't even find lowly people attractive. (chuckles) You know, like lowly in a sense, like lowly like me. I don't even I wouldn't even find anyone in my program, say for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">example, attractive because it would just be like \"What are you doing with your life? You know, you're this old and you've not completed a PhD or you don't have an interesting job.\" Like me. (chuckles) (pause) I don't know if I can be with someone who is my equal. Like I wouldn't even know who my equal <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB2\">would be, you know? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">I mean, like a lot of stuff that, you know, I find lacking in myself I feel like it's not just because of some psychological issue. It's also just the way that I was brought up. I feel I was brought up with nothing and not just like I don't mean money. I mean, money is immaterial. It's the culture <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">that you're brought up with, the people. I feel like there was just no one there when I was growing up. It was just my mom and how much could she have compensated for the lack of a father or a grandmother, a grandfather, aunts, uncles, cousins, you know? She couldn't have compensated for all of those. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF2\">So that's the kind of lack that I feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">Even in my work, I feel that that's the lack because generally most people are you know, they grow up in a family and grandmas tell them stories. Then later on they find themselves reflecting on those, or they just feel like they lived a whole like a life that feels very full, you know, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">there are all these people who can share your life, all these elements of culture that you can reflect on or, you know, feel connected with. I just feel disconnected from a lot of this stuff, so I can either feel bad about it or I can borrow from other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">Like I can borrow someone else's family or I could try to create my own kind of patchwork of inherited culture. Just like make it up (pause) by reading and by learning things. So I feel like going to Nepal and talking to people there makes me feel like I'm part of this, you know? Why not? I speak the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">language. I look like them, you know. I may not live with them the whole year, but I could share their concerns. I could this is my culture, you know. I could inherit it. (chuckles) You know, who is going to stop me from laying claim to it, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">I was actually telling my mom this. That, you know, how can I succeed because I just have not been brought up with stories. I was brought up with silence, it feels like. You know, there's like crickets. Not, you know, actual crickets. (chuckles) But, you know, when it comes to like stories or like an <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB1\">abundance of food or aunts walking about cooking and all that. There was none of that. You know, there was just me and her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559324\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Did she ever read you stories?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: My uncle did, like her brother. He had bought me a lot of books right before he came to the US. Yeah, and like she would record like I would just make up stories. I would read some story, and then she would record my voice as I was narrating the story, and then I'd sort of forget to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">up my own version of the story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">There are those moments, but there was definitely a big lack of people who came to visit us. And even now, like I don't communicate at all with my dad's side of the family. I was there in Bhutan most of the time because that's where Chris (ph) is at and I just felt a little a sudden moment where <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">I realized that all of my dad's side of the family is in Bhutan, and what if I just ran into someone, you know, just randomly, would they recognize me? Probably not. But yeah, so they're not there, and my mom's side of the family is not there either. So I just have absolutely no family right now, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E32\">that's always been the case. (chuckles) I wish I could think of a different (inaudible at 00:25:53). That's probably the only solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">One solution is to think that they are there. You know, what I know about them I could just make do with that, and then just not worry so much that they don't call or I don't ever see them. (chuckles) That's okay. (chuckles) I can see strangers and meet new people and make new friends. (pause) But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">I mean, I know that I function from thinking in terms of lack and maybe the solution is to think in terms of I'm not going to say plenty but, you know, not lack. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: When I listen to you often I think about how difficult it is for you to find focus and commit to something. I often see you in the image of someone sort of wandering about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess I've always been like that. I wish I could be steady and stick to something. (chuckles) I never had the knack for doing that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: And your being here one way of looking about being here is it's like taking your life more seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Taking yourself more seriously, taking your life choices more seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I definitely know I have the need for therapy, I just kind of I'm wondering even if I quit the job, I'll probably want to switch insurance because I inquired at my current workplace about switching from an HMO to a PPO, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: And they said that (inaudible at 00:28:11) doesn't allow you to do that like in the middle of the year. But then if I quit my job and get a new insurance, then maybe I could off-the-bat ask for a PPO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Don't you get insurance isn't there an insurance policy through school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that's kind of going to be expensive if I don't have a job. Yeah, it's like $2,000 a semester. (chuckles) That's a lot. Because state insurance is cheap or it's free. Like if I'm barely earning anything (chuckles) then I might qualify for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559324\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's about they cover you for the year, so it's about $300 a month. The $2,000 a year is about $300 a month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: That's a lot of money.

Well, I need to give because where is she going to live?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Would she go to a homeless shelter? Where would she go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) But I think she yeah, I could give up my place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: No, I want to stay with this for a second.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: Would she go to a homeless shelter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) I mean, she has a little bit of savings, so she probably could pay her rent until the savings run out. But yeah, I think the expectation is that I would help. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm sort of putting aside the expectation. What would she do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I think she would. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: She would live in a homeless shelter? That's what she would choose to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: I don't know. This is not even like a possibility. I haven't discussed this I mean, this has never been brought up, so I'm not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Does she know how hard it is for you to make ends meet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: Well, like if I have a job, then it's not hard. But if I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: It sounds like right now it might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (pause) I don't know. I feel so tight. I mean, what is the expression? What's the word? I feel so confused, like torn, yeah. I want to be able to support her and make her happy, but that it is making me unhappy. (chuckles) And it's just not my goal. Like I remember the year that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201351\">I was full-time. I got no work done, and I was really unhappy about that. I paid off my loans and that's a good thing. But really, I just I will not feel good about myself until I have something to show for my work. That's just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: That's part of the problem. I'm not at all discouraging you. I think it's wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: I think your passion is the deepest sense of self-expression, especially with someone with talent. But that statement \"I won't feel good about myself until this,\" that's the problem, that there's an \"until.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: I know. I hate that I've been thinking this way. (chuckles) I don't know. Like why should I feel good about myself? Like why I mean, why even think in those terms? I know that is great that there's actually people out there who don't even give two hoots about whether they're likeable or <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F1\">not. They're there, you know? (chuckles) They are just undeniably there, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">I love that. I think that's so nice, to be able to just not even think in those terms. Like not even spend like any minute of any day. (chuckles) Most days, you know. That's nice. Just get on with your work. (chuckles) (pause) I think I have those moments when I'm like busy (chuckles), getting stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201431\">done. (pause) But then something happens, and then I'm just feeling miserable. Like I said, you know, in Nepal like I what was it? So like I helped Chris (ph) with some interviews and that was nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20142-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20142-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559324\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">And then we went to visit these caves, like fifth century old caves where they have these [rock-cut] (ph) carvings, caves off of Bhutan. Then I came back and I thought about that. I mean, it was kind of going well, so I was feeling good about that. Then, you know, his mom started acting crabby and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201471\">I was completely in the dumps again. (chuckles) It was like I feel horrible about myself, Chris (ph) is so great, he has achieved so much. His dad actually said, you know, \"People like Chris (ph) are made from a different -\" the expression is like \"they're made from a different kind of clay or soil\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201472\">or whatever. \"But you and I are from a very ordinary soil.\" (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">It's not that I want to be great or anything, but not that, you know, could Chris (ph) even think about who is great and who isn't, you know? And I'd just like to get to that point, you know. I'd just like to get to a place where people around me and then me included, we don't think about who is great <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">and who is not, who has achieved how much, you know? I think it's really just like people in the place of authority that mess us up, you know. Like parents, like my mom or, you know, his parents who give candy and then I don't get any. (chuckles) And I'm just like okay, you know, I guess I didn't deserve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">Whereas when, you know, I was traveling with Chris (ph) and another friend of mine, we didn't spend time thinking about who is big and who is small, you know, and I didn't either. So I felt pretty I felt I could interact with them. And so, yeah, they've read a lot more books than I have or just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F1\">different books, you know. They've read more technical stuff. This woman was pursuing (inaudible at 00:36:28) sociology and I kept saying, you know, \"You are articulating this much better than me\" and she kept interrupting me and saying \"Don't say that.\" So anyway, I was able to engage with her. It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F2\">not like I feel it's not like I can't or that I'm dumber than her or anything. We were just differently talented, and it's nice to be able to occupy that space where you don't have people judging you, you know, and making you feel inadequate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">I felt like that happened when Chris's (ph) parents were around and didn't happen when Chris (ph) and his friends were around. So I wonder if that's the thing, that it's just like people in authority kind of look at me in a certain way and I feel small or something. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: What is your thought about not having therapy? What will happen if you don't have it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: I guess I could go back to the old ways of thinking which are harmful for me. I know it would mean that I would take care of some really deep-seated notions I have about things that are harmful right now. I know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: That's pretty big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I mean, I am thinking that even if I do quit, then I'll definitely look into whatever new insurance I get and see if I can still continue. I mean, it's not I don't want to stop it just for the sake of stopping. (pause) I just wonder if I could just feel that way for an extended <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D1\">period of time instead of just on vacation, you know? Feeling like I'm not being judged and I am, you know, this whole person that people like and want to talk to and want to get to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2015C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559324\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yes, we have a lot of work to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: I mean it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: I'm very serious about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: You mean unless we do this, people won't want to know me?

(chuckles) I think I'm doing a social service (chuckles) by coming here because if I'm unpleasant, then I think people around me will not have a good time either. (chuckles) And like some people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F1\">you know, there are others who don't want to just throw me away.

So I got this bag for her and I was like, this is so great, I want it for myself. So she didn't like it. She couldn't fit her <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201971\">iPad in, and then I took it. I was like, I could've bought two, one for her and one for myself, but I didn't buy any for myself because I just felt like I wouldn't have even gone to this place had she not said \"I need a bag,\" you know. She couldn't come with me, so I went to buy it for her.

(pause) I don't know. I do have a bag. (chuckles) And then last night, he said he needs therapy too because he's so confused. Just the whole thing, whether we should be together or not.
