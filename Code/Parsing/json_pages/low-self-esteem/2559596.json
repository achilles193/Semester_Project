I looked over it very quickly. I didn't but thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Maybe it would be easier if we did one session at a time and I mailed that claim over to them because it seems like now they owe money and they're taking longer like before only one every two weeks so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I may at some point soon be able to figure out how to submit to them directly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Hopefully in the next month. So once that happens that would make it even easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's kind of stressful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Well, I appreciate you're looking into it. I can follow up, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I'm not trying to not pay you. I just want to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh no, no. I understand all that. I absolutely understand that. Insurance companies can be very frustrating. I totally understand how (inaudible). I'm just making sure. Were you worried that that's what I thought?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: It's a lot and it's been a long time, so I was getting frustrated so I thought -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Why would I think you'd not want to pay me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Oh I don't know. Just me. I wasn't thinking clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Okay. Well, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: You're welcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I'm here. And I'm on time. Yeah, Steve drove me and we got here two hours early.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Two hours early?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes. And I (inaudible). So that was good. Where should we start? Probably everything like I told you last time, I think, I don't whether I should start with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Well, there's no right place to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Do you have any questions at all? Do I understand all of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Understand eating disorders in general, or eating disorders in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. How have you helped have you helped anybody with an eating disorder?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: How do you go about doing that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: The general idea is trying to understand the meaning of it and what it's helping you with. No one does anything that is completely self-sabotaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: There may be self-sabotaging features to it they're doing it for other reasons that are helping them in some way. So in a very general sense, that's how I think about it. That's how I help people. You know work with them by thinking about what it could mean for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Have you ever heard of it as being like a mental issue and not only a medical issue as opposed to like getting something out of it? Like there's a reason why it happens? Like a chemical imbalance or hormone imbalance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well, hormonal imbalances don't make you do specific behaviors. They may make you more likely to do something or another, but there's no like gene that tells you to be for example, you may feel upset and that what leads to it, but people have said they can do lots of things with it, so it'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Are you thinking it's more because you said it's around your periods so -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: So, that's what your thoughts were about, being a hormonal issue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because it is like yeah, like I feel (unclear) and stressed. And then if I haven't eaten in a while, I'll eat a lot, then I think I feel guilty that I've overeaten but I always like have had to control my weight because I was heavy as a kid, so that I could eat part of so that I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200531\">find a different way to control it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559596\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Were you teased?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. For a long time. I mean, that just comes with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Were you I mean, especially these days, kids are there are a lot of kids who are not thin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: So it's usually one of those it's if you're one of the heavier kids versus just being a little overweight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Oh, no. It was like 160 lbs, you know, in elementary school. But I was this height.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I was very tall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. I grew up really fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: In elementary school. How? So you didn't, even after, even after you hit puberty you mean you didn't grow anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I grew like one inch. I hit puberty really early. I had like breasts in the fourth grade, pretty much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Did people tease you for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don't remember that. I remember always trying to hide them. I don't think people teased me though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Do you think you were the first developed girl?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Did you feel kind of exposed, like maybe stuck out or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: No. I think it was more like the weight issue. It was that issue. Yeah. And I went into I lost weight really fast, like I went from 6th grade to 7th grade I dropped like 40 lbs in a summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: So I was like a different person going into like junior high, which was a different school. And that was just from not eating. Because I went from like just kind of like eating a small meal but I wasn't bulimic when I lost the weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: When you lost that weight, were you then underweight? Or were you more of a normal weight then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: I was at a normal weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: And then what happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: I just always felt bad. I think that's what it was. Like I was normal weight but I always felt heavier than everybody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: And when did you start losing more weight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: I think I always have stayed like in the same weight category. One time I was really, really thin but like with my last relationship I lost like 30 lbs like in the summer. That was because of stress. I was so stressed. I think you're body works in overdrive when you're stressed. I lost a lot of weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: You were stressed about how he was treating you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: It was like hopeless. It was just transition to college and going to school and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Did your parents notice when you lost all that weight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: What did they comment on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Oh well, they knew I was going through when I broke up with my boyfriend. Like I had major (unclear) depression and I didn't sleep for a month so they had to give me medication to sleep. It was very stressful. But my mother was there like throughout the whole thing for me. I kind of just did <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200931\">what I had to do. I picked up like three jobs and I just worked and didn't think about things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: Was it more or less stressful after you left the relationship and broke up with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: I think it was more after because like everything kind of (unclear) it was like a loss. It was more like I had all my eggs in one basket, you know. Like that. I did everything for the relationship. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: The way you at times feel about Steve.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559596\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Right. I think that's like my problem. Like I didn't have a relationship without giving my whole self to a person. I feel like I should be able to balance that. I'm starting to realize that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">(Pause): [00:09:08 00:09:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Like I'm not a piece in our relationship where I'm comfortable in that. I have to work on that. Like if I don't have all my attention towards the relationship, he's not going to leave me. That's (unclear) thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And so when you say, \"your whole self,\" is it your attention that you're referring to primarily?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: My attention, financially I did that with both relationships. And like I instead of putting more focus on school, I did more focus on them, which I regret. I got angry with them. I'm still here. I can still go back to school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: You are still here and you can go back to school actually at any age, but you're still here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You mentioned (unclear) individually that you were thinking about that. Are you still thinking about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. But it's just a process with education programs. There's always process. It takes years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Even the process to get in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Because you need all sorts of prerequisites, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Right. Because mine are too old. They have to be less than five years. So it's like you have to start all over with them. But it's what I want. So now I'm in the process of doing that, seeing if I can get back into my old program and, if not, taking two of my classes that I need that are in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">an online program but then they switched the prereqs so now I have to go back and take other classes, which they'll always do that. There's going to always be a catch like with the online schools and with any (unclear) program. I just have to do it before they change something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You seem at the moment kind of choked up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I know you're choked up a lot but what do you think at the moment it's about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: My disappointment. I was like disappointed like in high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: From what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Just like my choices that I make. (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">(Pause): [00:11:42 00:12:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: Like I feel like I give so much to my job and my boyfriend and everybody else and there is like no more time for me. (Crying) So that's like I don't know how to do that for myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that sort of relates to my next question what would a time for you look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: Like school. Like being able to go to the gym to work out and just like maybe have a social life. I don't have that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Because of sort of limitations outside or limitations or constraints you put on yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: Like work. I actually pay the bills. I think financially I'm the only provider.

It's like I've generalized for it and I don't even know what I'm afraid of, but like I don't do anything until the last minute because I have to think about it and over-analyze it, so it's the same with school, like I'm so worried I'm (crying) going to go back <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">and like there's going to be a stressful situation and I'm just going to fail out, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Why would you fail out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Because that's happened twice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And how did that happen?

One is the getting help the getting tools to deal with the immediate feeling and the other is to sort of pick apart and look at what's causing so much stress and anxiety, you know, is the source of it. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F31\">think it's a combination I don't expect you to have an immediate answer to it. I think that's a complicated question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Really complicated.

Were you overeating as a kid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: I just don't think like we ever ate the right things as a kid.

It was an Italian family and they liked spaghetti and meat balls and pasta and you know, macaroni and cheese and all that, and if you have a slow metabolism as my family seems to, there's a lot of heavy people in my family, it's not going to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: Were there a lot of certain junk food around as well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: Not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Mostly just the cuisine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I get stressed out about the house, like if it's messy, like that really stresses me out. And finances and just like responsibilities. Even if I'm like in a social environment.

He takes care of that. It's like luxury when you don't have them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F1\">But that's fine with her. She's a very simple person.

Is she like -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: She's like a diet aide (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Ha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: So he's depriving himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Did you feel that deprivation in the family home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">CLIENT: I don't know, I never really thought about it. I mean, we always like I worked my whole life. I worked in high school, I worked in junior high. I had a paper route, so you know, I probably had like $20 so far. I provided for myself. They weren't going to give me money and provide me with nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF1\">clothes. I was going to do it for myself. I mean, it's a good experience, I have working skills. I don't have things handed to me, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Well, it's nice to feel self-sufficient, but it's also nice to feel taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">THERAPIST: And certainly one of your complaints when we were working as couples was you didn't feel taken care of enough by Steve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">CLIENT: Right. He likes to be taken care of. Today's my birthday so he's taking -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Happy birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">CLIENT: Thank you. I think eventually our relationship will be different. I have a lot of faith in him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">THERAPIST: What do you imagine it will be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">CLIENT: He's such a smart person and I think gradually I'll like get his education and think I can work like part time and have a family. Like I see that with us. That would be nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like he feels more comfortable about being taken care of than you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, probably. (Chuckles) We got together with his whole family they just they baby him, they worry about him. And you know, like his mother says things like, \"Steve doesn't cook. Steve cooks?\" Like she's babied him his whole life you know (unclear). The \"only child syndrome,\" I'm thinking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C31\">He's still like mentally like a 24-year old, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Twenty-four.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, 24, 25. Still young, a little immature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">THERAPIST: You think so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">CLIENT: Probably in some ways, I'm sure. Like we've been having like good weeks, like I started the pill and I just feel like I'm (unclear). So that's when I have an issue with him and am able to talk to him about it and tell him I'm not really attacking him, like I just have these feelings and I needed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB1\">to let him know. It works better than yelling at somebody. That doesn't work. And yeah, I need someone (inaudible) doesn't work either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">THERAPIST: No. (Unclear) doesn't work, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">CLIENT: Right. I'm just like, I just feel like (unclear) I just tell their aunt to give them a call. Give them some advice where I can't. You know they want to see him doing better than he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">THERAPIST: In terms of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT: Like education because he doesn't have a GED and is going to school. They're all nurses and they feel like he has like ADHD or ADD and felt like he's always had that. So like I just told them they should talk to him about it like I can't. I've tried.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559596\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">THERAPIST: He's more in touch with that part of him that likes being taken care of and you're more in touch with that part of you that likes to be self-sufficient. But there are times I think that you feel kind of alone in that and then you feel alone like, 'oh my God, everything's up to me,\" and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D51\">imagine that's part of the stress you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yes. You start talking to everybody else and they look at your situation and tell you like, 'that's not right.' Like my co-workers and stuff. Like they don't think it's right that I pay the (unclear) car bills. It's not (unclear) and somewhat that I don't like it either.

Does it make you feel good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. And when I got home I'm like, I like resent him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">(Pause): [00:35:49 00:36:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: I don't think it's going to be like this forever.

Like he has that luxury and you don't have that luxury.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">CLIENT: I think he's always had that luxury. His mother pays for everything for him, too. I don't think I ever wanted that, though. I mean, sometimes it's nice but I like being self-sufficient. I never I dated guys that had money and had it all together and like that did not turn me on. I felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E71\">they were buying me. So it didn't work out. I don't like when like people pay for me all the time.

Like you dad makes the money so he gets to call the shots which is not true in every family and in some families one person makes the money and the other person calls all the shots or they equally <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E91\">call the shots, but it sounds like your dad's attitude is more like, 'this is my money, I'll say what I'll do with it rather than what you'll do with it.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">CLIENT: Right.

I'm like, marriage is (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I certainly don't think you feel that way in your position. I was wondering in the position where the guy has all the money, whether you feel like that could be a potential where you're disempowered somehow because you're bringing in the money, like he's buying you off, (inaudible), <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF1\">he can do just whatever he wants and if you were with anyone else or doing for anyone else, (unclear) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: I think that's why, exactly why I never went out with those guys.

I just I always talked with my mother and like I always talked with my dad because I didn't agree with whatever he said because he didn't make sense to me. My mother was really the passive one who did whatever he wanted and would do it behind his back because I would tell her <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202031\">what I believed and what I got was like real and I would tell them like they were wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20205\">THERAPIST: About?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20207\">CLIENT: Anything. Religion. School. Even about going out on a date. Like about everything like everything was fake. Like, 'something's going to happen to you,' like you had to come home at a certain time, even like I wanted to go to travel, my parents would never let me do that.

I don't fear, like I'm not protecting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Do you have the feeling that you do that just to distract yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020F\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20211\">THERAPIST: Sort of fill the time with activity?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20213\">CLIENT: Um hmm [yes].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20215\">THERAPIST: What do you think you might be distracting yourself from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">CLIENT: I just get so depressed sometimes, for no reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20219\">THERAPIST: I don't think anybody gets depressed for no reason.

I don't know, I just feel sometimes, really down and that's a distraction, you know? Like you don't want to do what you need to do. You know you don't want to be out (inaudible), you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D\">THERAPIST: Do you think that food helps you with the depression, too, when you eat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021F\">CLIENT: When I eat healthy, I feel happy. Yeah. Like I diet reflects energy. Yeah. So I'm not quite sure about the media. I just don't get it myself.

I was thinking about what you were saying earlier on about the insurance and you have been processing it and I was thinking about this issue of trust again. Like, we talked about it very early on and also that comes up between you and Steve a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">THERAPIST: And you know, just trust, to feel a basic trust in each other like do I trust you that you're doing the best you can with that? And fearing that I don't trust you somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">THERAPIST: I think, you know I think it's something for us to think about. I think it's really important because it's very impractical to live in the world when you feel that you can't trust people and other people don't trust you. You know it's hard to feel sort of safe and at ease, not stressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">THERAPIST: So, yeah, we can think about that. And in terms of the time, I just wanted to make the cancellation policy (cross talk) so yeah, I don't want you, even if it's your birthday to cry and so forth on your birthday, but maybe it's cathartic, too. But yeah, I do I treat the times that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202351\">save for you pretty seriously, but then turn away other people who want those times and I only do get so if I save the times for you I do need you to use it. If you in advance tell me, that's fine, but I do am pretty protective of that. That's sort of helped me think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">THERAPIST: Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no I know.

I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">THERAPIST: And I can offer you this time as an ongoing time, this afternoon time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">CLIENT: All right. I'll have to e-mail you over the next week because I'm back to work and it looks like they have me working a lot and a lot of nights and a lot of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">THERAPIST: And on Tuesdays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">CLIENT: Tuesday I'm working nights. I'm not sure, like I'm going back in, that's the only thing is that I have to go in at 7 p.m. That means I won't sleep before coming here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20249\">THERAPIST: Right. So if you picked a time earlier like I could potentially do 2:30.
