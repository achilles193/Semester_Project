So it kind of\u2014it made me a little sad. [chuckles] A [peaceful? 6:50] injury. It\u2019s not that bad, but I just felt low because of it. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Low how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, just sad and depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Because you fell?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know, I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m doing so well with our running.\u201d And I won\u2019t be able to for like a few days or something. I don\u2019t know. It was like God was trying to punish me or something, whatever. I mean, I guess I was curious why like a small physical injury can affect my mood. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">But it did. It shouldn\u2019t, you know. [pause] And my mom came right over and helped me. So it\u2019s not like\u2014you know, it\u2019s not even like a sign of all our blues. I guess it\u2019s maybe I\u2019m also sad because of other things. Like I didn\u2019t hear back from this guy, so I was just\u2014that made me think. And now I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for a relationship. Or definitely not a new relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, you didn\u2019t hear back.

I don\u2019t understand. [9:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Oh, no. So he work\u2014he goes to Ohio during the week and comes back on the weekend. And I don\u2019t know, just\u2014we don\u2019t talk on the phone, so that makes me anxious or insecure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like\u2014you didn\u2019t hear back, it\u2019s like you called him and he hasn\u2019t called you back, is that what you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: No, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I just didn\u2019t hear from him on Monday and so I just felt insecure. Yeah. I just kept thinking, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not a priority,\u201d and, you know. Despite, you know, I [texting him? 9:46], \u201cYou know, even if you\u2019re busy you can kind of find the time to send a text or something.\u201d I don\u2019t know. I just kept\u2014keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">on [bearing and go back to?] my previous relationships where we were talking on the phone all the time and we were very connected. So I\u2019m like why\u2014I don\u2019t think it would [throw that off?], that connection, that love. [pause] [10:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">But I guess from Monday, just that conversation about power by association. I don\u2019t know. I guess I should have pursued that more, right? It seems to be a fundamental issue for me. [pause] I guess I do think about how like being part of a whole, and being like a contributing member of a community. Only <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">now it\u2019s starting. I mean, I only started doing this now. I mean, and this is healthy and positive. So I\u2019m hoping that this will help me to think more positively about how I can be part of the whole without wanting to be outside of it or\u2014you know, like that\u2014because what I was describing on Monday, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">that whole experience with my neighborhood children, like renting out a little room in that complex of bungalows, and very much feeling like the underdog, and feeling like\u2014not just feeling but actually being lonely, right? I mean, didn\u2019t you think like that whole like search, as if they had a search <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">warrant. And they were kids, they were like 13, 14, and they\u2014what I felt horrible about was they could order around like 40 years olds, my parents. Or I don\u2019t know if my dad was there. Certainly my mom, you know, who had to step aside and who had to bear the horrible guilt or whatever of being told <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200294\">that her daughter was a thief, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561084\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">So that whole thing about being humiliated constantly, and therefore wanting to be an outsider. And yet at that moment when, you know, that posse of\u2014you know, sort of passing by, kind of a weird odd moment that I have not been able to forget, you know, and forgive myself for, for saying that, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">So overstepping my bounds and like\u2014 Yeah, I don\u2019t\u2014what do you call that? What was that? What is the\u2014what are the adjectives for it, that behavior of mine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. It was your experience. [14:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but like I don\u2019t know, how do you understand it, like what I said to them? Was I experiencing power by association, or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: You were putting them down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s power by association.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Because that\u2019s not power. People don\u2019t humiliate people if they feel powerful. You don\u2019t need\u2014if you really feel powerful you don\u2019t need to humiliate people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I almost like\u2014I wish I could understand it. I\u2019m just so ashamed of it that I don\u2019t\u2014 I haven\u2019t even tried to understand it. [pause] Well, what did I mean, \u201cYou have to be able to construct, own, purchase a bungalow,\u201d anyway? What did that mean when I said that? Was I feeling good about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">myself? Was I feeling insecure? What was it? [long pause] Yeah, I need adjectives. I need them for understanding this. [16:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Why do you feel\u2014like are you in a mental block? Or what\u2019s happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Like if someone else would tell me, \u201cThis is what you were feeling,\u201d and then I can accept their definition, or their feeling about it. Not just blindly accept it, but you know, understand it myself. Then I feel like I can maybe start to forgive myself for that and like put it behind me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: What would you be forgiving yourself for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: For whatever it is that I did that I don\u2019t even understand what I was doing. You know. I have not thought about it in this, you know, constructive way. [pause] Maybe I was trying to impress someone? Myself? My friend? Maybe I thought that that\u2019s what she wanted to hear. Or maybe there was a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">choice for me, or like either identify with the outsider or the insider, and I at that moment chose to remain inside. I mean, it was a disguise. [18:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: It was a disguise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like it was a lie. I mean, they didn\u2019t know who I was, right. They were strangers, they didn\u2019t know who I was. I could have been anyone. I mean, I stepped out of the bungalow. Who was to say that I didn\u2019t live there and own the whole damn thing, you know? No one. I mean, when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">walk out, how are they going to know that I\u2019m living in the small little hovel in it, or the entire place, you know? [pause] So I had like a choice I suppose. I wish I\u2019d remember the whole fucking episode, that would help. But I don\u2019t. But all I can do is guess, and all I can guess is that they probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">were soliciting. You know, they were probably like they wanted to perform or something, so that we would give them money, or you know. And we didn\u2019t let them in, or we didn\u2019t let them talk to our parents, or you know. And that\u2014 Yeah. Should I keep going or more on, move away?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561084\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re having a hard time taking charge of the session today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: [chuckles] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It seems like you\u2019re wanting direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. [laughs] Is that what you expect, you expect me to take charge? [20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: That question is [weird?].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you\u2019re feeling very insecure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I go through\u2014I go through phases like. But yeah, going back to that, like that\u2019s what I can think of, that maybe I wanted to remain inside, I wanted to feel for once what it was like to pretend, you know. Because here was like complete strangers seeing me with the rest of the kids. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">Who knows? I mean, maybe I was wrong, maybe they already could tell that I didn\u2019t belong with the rest of them because maybe my clothes were different. I don\u2019t even know if they were that different. But maybe they were. Or maybe they weren\u2019t and I thought I could be anyone, whatever I wanted to, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">I could be rich, you know, like my friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">And maybe I wanted to be closer to her. I mean, I loved her, you know, like we were very close. She cried so much when I was leaving for Istanbul, when I was moving away from the city. So despite like the social and economic differences there was a lot of affection. So I guess maybe I wanted to impress <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">her, to be closer to her than [the economics? 21:54], you know. So even though I ideologically would have identified with them\u2014as much ideology as a child could have, you know\u2014like it was to identify with her, and I felt horrible about that ever since. But why did you say what would I forgive myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">for? You don\u2019t see that there is something there? [22:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know what it was that you feel you did wrong, I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Well, I feel very bad about it, so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: You feel you insulted them or put them down, is that it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Like I feel horrible about myself that I could do such a thing. Like I feel like a hypocrite, or you know. And a liar, and you know. Yeah, anyone who puts the downtrodden down is like the biggest evildoer in my books, you know. So. I mean, I can\u2014as a writer I can see the gray, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">you know, I can identify with the wrongdoer, evildoer. But when it comes down to a black and white thing, you know, right and wrong, that\u2019s the quick judgment I would make is that that\u2019s wrong, you know. I guess I must have wanted approval so badly in that moment that I just\u2014the words just came out. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">Yeah. I don\u2019t know, I guess that period in my life was very\u2014 And they were really a few years, like maybe three. Maybe less. My mom would remember. But I guess they affected me profoundly. Your thinking really [is it?\/isn\u2019t? 24:04] like that, you know, like almost every day could have that effect. [sighs] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">So I guess I feel like I can\u2019t really allow myself to like feel power by association, you know. [24:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s hard if you feel power by association is against someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] Well, when people have power it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, so when are you going to abuse it?\u201d You know, like. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. Like when I was with my women\u2019s group last week\u2014I think it was last weekend\u2014and I had that kind of flare up for whatever convoluted reasons, maybe that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">was also what I think, that when I see everyone that\u2019s being so big and powerful, and me being so small. I guess maybe I place myself in that position of the one that they can harm because of their power. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561084\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">It\u2019s so funny, like that\u2019s what is funny. Because like when I\u2019m feeling that way, insecure and all, it\u2019s so intense, you know. Like in that instance like all the goodwill, all the good things people have done and said\u2014and done, you know, done\u2014they just cease to exist, I cease to see them, I become completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">blind from them, and all I feel is just hurt and like scared and angry and bitter. And then I have no control over what comes out of my mouth. [laughs] Or my thoughts, you know. And I know there\u2019s absolutely no chance of me being\u2014of me contributing or anything like that. [pause] [27:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">I don\u2019t know, I guess I want to figure out some kind of antidote to this feeling of, \u201cOh, you have everything and I have nothing.\u201d I don\u2019t know, is the antidote to think I have stuff to, you know? [pause] It\u2019s so funny, I feel like all these children and their judgments really are responsible. And maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">I shouldn\u2019t put it so harshly. But I feel like that\u2019s what that is. Like as a child like of course I had things I was proud of, and wanted to look at and be with, you know, at home. But they were put down viciously by these people, you know. So it was like a poison, you know. Like I didn\u2019t want to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">home and look at these things because they weren\u2019t good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I think it was still multi-determined. Because absolutely the way these children treated you had an impact on how you feel. But, you know, certainly your dad contributed to it too in terms of feeling kind of lonely and humiliated and hence wanting to lash out on others, and I think your mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">felt that way too. So you were already predisposed to that kind of feeling that way, and then it was just sort of intensified by the way you were treated by these kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: I mean, another way of looking at it too is kids are very good at picking up each other\u2019s vulnerabilities, and that may have been something that they saw in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] It\u2019s kind of scary. [30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Just like their whole life was just going to pass, you know. I mean, I was thinking this last night coming back from class. Like I\u2019m thinking, why do I always focus on the negative? Why do always focus on what I don\u2019t have? You know, because there is actually no way that you can build a life <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">if you think of what you don\u2019t have. Most of the stuff\u2014all of life is all about building on what you already have, you know. And like specifically in terms of writing, writing is all about that. You start with a small idea, but you build on it. You have a draft and it\u2019s messy, then you revise it, revise <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">it, revise it. You don\u2019t just write ten different stories in the first draft. No one does that. And all of life is all about that, relationships, you know. Like you don\u2019t just toss them out. You fix things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">And I feel like this relates back to my childhood where I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, we can spend 20 rupees on firecrackers, but\u2026\u201d And, you know, like how fucking evil of that stupid boy and that girl to like ruin that for me, you know. Yes, you can spend 500 rupees, because, you know, you\u2019re a fucking capitalist. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">And your showdown is going to be so much brighter and bigger and louder than my little showdown with the firecrackers, but\u2026 So all the joy that I was going to get is completely gone because of the way you humiliated me for how little\u2014you know, because my bag was tiny and yours was gigantic. And just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">because my Barbie doll couldn\u2019t move her arms up and down or whatever. Because mine costed less and yours didn\u2019t. And my frocks are, you know, less expensive. But all the joy that I was going to get looking at the things I already had, you know, just completely poisoned, completely ruined. I just feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D3\">like it\u2019s high time I fixed this, you know. [32:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561084\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">I mean, that\u2019s what joy is, right. Like the stuff you have you can put out and you look at it, and you look at it again, and you look at it again. [pause] I mean, that\u2019s what friends are too, right. You meet them over and over again. [pause] I wish I could go and like beat them up like really, really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">hard. But I don\u2019t have to, because life has already beaten them. [laughs] It\u2019s true, like two\u2014several years ago, it\u2019s been so long, I went back to my\u2014that town, and they were living in rented apartments. And that girl, a sex worker, was working in a call center in India. Yeah, their businesses failed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">completely and [laughs] they have nothing now. That made me feel really shocked and scared for them. [sighs] And here I am in therapy, you know, like I said, you know. So it\u2019s like they still have the power. [pause] [35:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">Then I mean, yeah, definitely my dad\u2019s negativity was far worse than these kids could ever have been. But those were like really the poison years. It\u2019s like I feel like I was in their lair, you know, like\u2014is that how you pronounce it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: [chuckles] Like really being chewed slowly, very, very slowly, but being chewed nonetheless. I hated all my stuff because of them. And I think children go through that I guess. You know, like they compare\u2014that\u2019s when they start first comparing, and saying, \u201cThose shoes are really better,\u201d and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">all that. [pause] I mean, of course I don\u2019t\u2014to some extent I don\u2019t do that. You know, like I have good pretty things and people like them and I feel good about them. But then I think in much more like deeper ways is how I experience this, that I don\u2019t have anything and they have everything. It doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200852\">come down to shoes and clothes and dolls, but it comes to other things now I guess. [very long pause, over 2 minutes] [39:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">What\u2014how to connect this with other things. I wonder you said why do I seek the company of\u2014what was it, superior people, or like high and mighty people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: People who put you down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: [pause] Yeah. I don\u2019t know if I seek them, right. I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re thinking, am I trying to replace my dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: [Yeah?]. Interesting. [pause] [40:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess I seek the company of people who have more. I guess that\u2019s a fair statement. I wouldn\u2019t say I seek the company of people who have less. And then you could even say, why do you even look at things that way, have more, have less, people are just people. I mean, this is obviously <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">subconsciously, it\u2019s not like consciously it\u2019s\u2014maybe it is conscious, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I sought\u2014I don\u2019t know if I sought. But like my first boyfriend I\u2019m thinking, you know, he was just an average guy. And there was no like have more, have less. It turned out that he had, you know, this, this and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F2\">this. Some of it was very useful to me, you know, like the fact that he knew how to drive and fix cars. [chuckles] But he\u2014yeah, he was average. I don\u2019t think I sought him out because he had more. Initially it was just that, you know, he was cute and, you know, he was funny, and we had some chemistry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F3\">and that was that. [41:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561084\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">And then I guess I became friends\u2014or sought out the church people because they seemed very passionate and energized, and they were kind, and they had a community. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that they put me down. I mean, they did put me down, but like the whole guilt thing. But that came not too much <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200911\">later. But yeah, it did come right away, and it was like also attractive, you know. I hadn\u2019t wallowed in that way before. I definitely enjoyed a lot of the wallowing, like thinking of myself as a sinner, and like convincing myself that I was a sinner. You know, like as a 16, 17 year old finding that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200912\">\u201cOh yeah, all my 17 years I\u2019ve done such sins.\u201d And I was really finding out just like other people\u2019s confessionals would be full of so many other things, like alcoholism, and like womanizing, and drugs, and mine would be like worshipping other gods. [laughs] Or, you know, being unkind to my mom. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200913\">I was very convinced that I was definitely like such a bad sinner. So that whole self-flogging was interesting. Maybe I\u2019m a sadist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">But yeah, like after that whole thing was over like seeking Ahmed. I guess I sought him out because he was, you know, intellectual and I hadn\u2019t\u2014and I wanted that and I didn\u2019t have that, so yeah, maybe I could think of him as that, as me seeking what I didn\u2019t have. [pause] Which I think was it concretely <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">or more abstractly? [44:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I guess in the abstract, like to just generalize, like do I like it when people put me down? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. I mean, it is more intense, right, it\u2019s more personal. So I like intense and personal. But it\u2019s weird to think that I get turned on by that, or like\u2014you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">know, not even turned on, but you know, like I seek it out. But maybe I think that they will help me grow. Not the fact that they put me down, but maybe that they\u2019re able\u2014the constructive criticism. And if not even that then just the fact that they have something I don\u2019t really, open my eyes to something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200972\">new. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">I mean, that\u2019s why I keep seeking Chris maybe. You know, like after this weekend when I saw him, it was like he was telling me a few little anecdotes about intellectual things and what he\u2019d read or something, and I was like, \u201cWow, I\u2019ve missed this so much.\u201d And yes, I mean, so many complicated things <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">that happened in that, you know, microsecond in my head, maybe one of the things that happens is me like flogging myself a little bit, saying, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be as smart as this.\u201d Or, \u201cYou\u2019re just totally wasting your life because you\u2019re not with him.\u201d Or like, \u201cYou spend two days <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200992\">away from him while he could have enlightened you in this way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Do you still spend a lot of time with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Not that much really. But yeah, I do see him like four or five days a week, but like just for a few hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561084\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of time.
