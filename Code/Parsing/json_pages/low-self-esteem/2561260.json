data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: So how was your week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: (sighs) Uh! Hectic!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Okay. Do tell!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. Where do I begin? My cousin was involved in, I guess, an altercation or something and was shoved, fell, hit her head, and had bleeding on the brain and all that; but she\u2019s fine. Thank God!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Oh, goodness!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Then my niece was involved in a really bad car accident; broke both her legs, her pelvis, had spine surgery, and she\u2019s fine, too. Thank God! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Goodness!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes! And then, I found out that my granddad\u2019s shingles are worse than they thought they were, so... But he\u2019s fine, too. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: How are you doing with all this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Um... I\u2019m hanging in there. I\u2019m good, as could be expected, I guess. You know, I\u2019m used to... I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m just used to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Just one thing after the other, kind of. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just deal with it as it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Used to the trauma of it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah! (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You know, it makes me wonder what kind of impact that has on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. You know, I sometimes find myself feeling a little tired; then sometimes I find myself, still want to push and go, you know? Then I\u2019ll tell myself, \u201cWell you know, you\u2019re really sleepy!\u201d I\u2019d be at the computer and, I\u2019ll be like this... and then next thing I know, I\u2019m up again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">and I\u2019m typing, and I have to go back the next day and read what I wrote because (laughs)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Because you nodded off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t remember what I wrote! (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: You know, I thought about our first session last week. It kind of stayed with me (client responds), this sort of you going to take this test and the experience that you had there, and just how devastating that was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Oh, man! It was a mess!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. It seems like that experience really kind of changed some things for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Um, it did. You know, it made me question myself, you know? As far as while I was in school, did I really retain what I\u2019ve been taught? (therapist affirms) You know, and I\u2019m still questioning that. Then I feel like, sometimes my memory is not what it should be. So then I say, \u201cWell, maybe it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">was me,\u201d you know? But then, at the same time, I said, \u201cBut my grades were good,\u201d you know and everything. I felt like I knew my stuff. So that takes me back to, \u201cOkay, did you really know your stuff or...\u201d I mean, it\u2019s, you know... I try to weigh it, and I can\u2019t seem to balance it in no type of way. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">I can\u2019t figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah! Can you... can you take me back a little bit about, sort of your experiences in school? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah... Like maybe...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you smiled!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: ...in grammar school on up? (therapist affirms) Okay. Um... I had a good mama. Maybe it was probably third, fourth grade, somewhere around there, I was really young, but I remember a teacher would tell me... She got really frustrated with me, because she said I raised my hand too much, I asked <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">too many questions. (therapist responds) I guess that really did impact me, because I still don\u2019t raise my hand to ask questions, you know. (chuckles) If I don\u2019t understand something, and I really want to get the full understanding, I can\u2019t help but to ask, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">Moving up the ladder, I... I would say in high school it was, doing a math problem. I can remember it pretty well. I believe it was... what were we doing? It was integers? The way that the teacher did the problem on the board, I couldn\u2019t figure it out the way she was showing it to me, but I did it my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">way, and it was the same answer that she had; but because I didn\u2019t follow the format that she gave, it was wrong. You know? I couldn\u2019t understand that, you know? So then I said, \u201cOkay, now I have a hard problem, a hard time with math.\u201d I have a phobia of math now. I try to take any course or anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">where I can avoid math (laughs) at all costs! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: So, it sounds like you\u2019ve learned some pretty powerful messages about yourself in school. (client affirms) And the message is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Well the message for me is that... I see things a little bit different than most people. What a lot of people find to be simple, I may find to be a little difficult. (therapist affirms) Then what I find to be difficult, they find to be simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: And, like for example, (sighs) I could be reading something, and my interpretation of it would be a little bit different than somebody else\u2019s, you know, or than most people sometimes. But then, when we sit back and we discuss it (like I\u2019m in a book club, we\u2019re discussing it and everything), <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">and then we both come to the same conclusion in the end, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">And... Then, to another example, it\u2019s like... Somebody could say something, like as a joke or whatever; where everyone else would get it, I\u2019m like a little slow to get it. (therapist affirms) Then it\u2019s like, when I hear it again, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh!\u201d But to me, it wasn\u2019t... (laughs) you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t... I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: But you know, it\u2019s funny, because you\u2019ve taken these experiences to mean something negative about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well? You tell me!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess I just feel like I should be... more intelligent. I should be more smarter or... You know, it\u2019s like I\u2019m lacking something and I don\u2019t know what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: What is it you think you\u2019re lacking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Um... (pause) Oh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still trying to figure it out. You know, I think about it all the time, and you know, I just, I can\u2019t figure it out for the life of me. You know, I feel like I\u2019ve been in school all of my life, you know, and I\u2019m still at this point, where I should have... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">been past this point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of \u201cI should have been.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I hate to sing that song, that Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: No, I tell, you know, it doesn\u2019t sound like Could, Would, Shoulda. But you\u2019re really hard on yourself about where you \u201cshould\u201d be or what you \u201cshould\u201d be doing. (client affirms) All right, where does that come from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I... I don\u2019t know. (therapist chuckles) I\u2019m serious! I, you know... Oh, God! Here comes the tears... Um... (pause) I don\u2019t know. I just, I feel like if I\u2019ve been in school all this time... why am I just now at this point, you know? It\u2019s almost like... It\u2019s almost as if I am a little slower, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">you know. I don\u2019t know. Then I tell myself, I said, \u201cWell, you have to take into consideration that, okay, you stopped to have your kids. You know, then you raised your babies and stuff and...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: How painful is this for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Very, I guess. (therapist affirms) You know, and (sighs) then I tell myself, I say, \u201cWell, if I didn\u2019t have to deal with my mother and her drugs, and... help to take care of my sisters at an early age, you know, maybe my mindset would have been different.\u201d You know, maybe I could have, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">all the things that I think I\u2019m trying to do now, I would have done then, you know? I feel like now, the role has been reversed somewhat, and I feel like the child in me is ready to come out and... But I\u2019m like, \u201cGod, you\u2019re 41!\u201d I mean, you know, you\u2019re thinking, I feel like I\u2019m thinking backwards <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">instead of forward. You know, sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: And when you say, \u201cthinking backwards,\u201d what do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I mean like (sighs)... what, the things that I didn\u2019t do or wasn\u2019t able to do back then, I\u2019m trying to push it forward, like now. You know, live it now. (therapist affirms) You know, and I feel like it\u2019s inappropriate, you know? It\u2019s like when I... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s inappropriate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: You know, to like, want to go skating and want to... because I just feel like now, I should be thinking (chuckles), you know and maybe like a higher plane, you know, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: There is that word again! You just punish yourself, don\u2019t you? \u201cI shoulda! Why didn\u2019t I? But you know, I want to go back to something, you know. From the little bit you told me in our first session last week, your mom was addicted to drugs and you had to raise your sisters. (client affirms) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">Okay. And sort of, you know, how old were you again, as your...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Ten. I was ten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Okay. So you were ten. So you had to grow up, essentially. (client affirms) All right. Then you had kids, how old were you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Um, I had my... Oh gosh! Ah, well, when I first became pregnant, I was 16. (therapist affirms) And I had a miscarriage at home...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Oh goodness! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: ...and I didn\u2019t know what it was, in the toilet, you know. So I picked it up, I wrapped it in tissue, and put it in my pocket. I went to school, all day, and I said, \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m going to go see the doctor, let him know what happened.\u201d When I showed it to him, you know, he kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">of like giggled a little bit and told me, he said, \u201cThis is the fetus.\u201d And that just... I don\u2019t know. It like really blew my mind. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI walked around school all day long with a baby in my pocket.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Oh, Yvette! How did you feel about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Oh! (crying) Not good, you know? And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: It even hurts you now. (client sniffles) What are you feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: I just feel like... I should have... I know there\u2019s that word again (chuckles), I just feel like I should have known that, you know. I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Where you supposed to have known that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know. I think sometimes, I tell myself that if you could put yourself in a predicament, you know, you should... I mean if you\u2019re, if you have enough sense to do something, you should know... I don\u2019t even know the right way to say that. Not the... consequence, well, yeah. Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">sometimes the consequence that comes, you know, along with it. You know, or even just the education part of it. You know, I feel like, if, okay, I\u2019m having sex. I become pregnant.

Sixteen, yeah? (client affirms) So I know you had to grow up pretty fast, at ten; but that doesn\u2019t mean your knowledge base caught up with that. So how many 16-year-olds do you know who have sex that don\u2019t know that much about it? Or grown people, for that matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: A lot!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: So where were you supposed to have known that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know! You know, I feel like, okay, if I\u2019m trying to teach my sister something, how can I teach them if I don\u2019t know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Because you were ten! Ten! (client affirms) So you were a child! (client affirms) So you had to grow up fast emotionally. (client heartily affirms) Well, yeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean, you know, you had a tenth-grade education at ten years old. Where were you supposed to get that information? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">See, you know, I hear you have this story of struggle and pain and determination, right? (client affirms) And you hear, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I, why couldn\u2019t I, I should have.\u201d At 16 years old, how were you to know? You know, because I\u2019m sure nobody told you. (client agrees) Not really. Okay. Even, you\u2019re 16, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200952\">you don\u2019t know what that means. So, do you know about how far along you were? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Um... It had to be pretty early, in my mind. Maybe... maybe... maybe two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Okay. So how would you have known that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: (pause) Hmm. I don\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Where would that have come from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: You know, I wonder, really... I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re smart enough to sort of take the tissue and take it to a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I used to steal my mom\u2019s medical card out of (chuckles) her purse to go to the doctor, because she was the type... She was a good mom before the drugs. You know, really good. But then, when she started with the drugs and everything, she started lacking with her responsibilities, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">you know: wouldn\u2019t take us to the doctor for check-ups, you know, we wouldn\u2019t go to the dentist, you know, things like that. She would feed her boyfriend before she fed her kids, you know. Just, you know, things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">I said, well, you know, one time I kissed a boy and I thought I was pregnant, because he put his tongue in my mouth. (therapist affirms) You know, and then I missed my period; it was late. So I went to my aunt, you know, who I can go to for everything, you know, God rest her soul. She told me, \u201cOkay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">you know what? We\u2019re going to go to the doctor. I\u2019m going to take you myself.\u201d (therapist affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">I was so glad, because I was scared! You know? Before we could leave out the door, I felt wet and cold and I told her, I said, \u201cWait, I have to go to the washroom.\u201d I go in the washroom, and I seen it, Jackie says, \u201cYes, Lord!\u201d (laughs) (therapist affirms) When I told her, she said, \u201cWait a minute. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">Let, come here, I need to talk to you,\u201d you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">She said, \u201cWell, did you really have sex?\u201d And I told her, I said, \u201cNo.\u201d I said, \u201cHe kissed me.\u201d You know, and then she said, \u201cWhat do you mean, he kissed you? I said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we did. He kissed me and he put his tongue in my mouth, so, you know, I thought that that\u2019s why my period didn\u2019t come on.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">I mean, it was, and now that I\u2019m older, I can laugh at it. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: But to me, that shows a couple of things, right? One, where were you to have known, because adults (to scare kids from having sex), will often say, \u201cIf you kiss somebody, you\u2019ll get pregnant!\u201d Right? (client affirms and laughs) So I\u2019m sure you heard that! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: You\u2019re right! I heard that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yes! Okay, and so you did the smart thing. You told an adult (client responds), right? You knew that if you don\u2019t have your period, it could mean that you\u2019re pregnant. You told an adult, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the doctor\u201d (client affirms), right? When you got your period, she said, \u201cOh, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">don\u2019t know!\u201d (client affirms) But see, where were you to have known? So then, at 16, how would you have known that, and yet you\u2019re smart enough to pick up the tissue, wrap it up, and go to the doctor and say, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d (client affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">So where\u2019s the part that you should have known? (pause) See, you have recognized things that you shouldn\u2019t have known, and I recognize things that you knew, even then. You can\u2019t know something until you know it. (client affirms) Right? So even if you know how babies are made, at 16, that doesn\u2019t mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">you sort of put it all together. You\u2019re 16! (client affirms) Managing your mom\u2019s drug issues, taking care of your sisters. Where was there room for you in all that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: (pause) Oh! Where was there room?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Where was there room for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: (pause) I didn\u2019t have any. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: No. So you were supposed to what? Have a college degree by the time you were 20 (client affirms), all the while you were taking care of your sisters and raising your... Yeah, and then having your sons and then, you know, watching your mother deteriorate, and stealing her medical card so you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">and your siblings could get medical care, and while you\u2019re surviving, what? You\u2019re supposed to do what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: (heavy sigh) I don\u2019t know. Try to breath, I guess! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Right! So what\u2019s my point here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know. Maybe... (pause) I don\u2019t know. (chuckles) It\u2019s like, I have a big cloud up here, and I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: But what do you take away from what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: That... I know a put a lot of pressure on myself. (therapist responds) That I put myself in a, you know, in a situation where I think I should know, or I should have known certain things, when it was just impossible for me to know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Oh, yes! Say that again, please!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It was what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: It was impossible... for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It was impossible. And yet, your survival instinct was so strong that you pulled your family out of the brink, as a young girl, did the job of your mother in raising your sisters, took care of your sons, and now people are grown enough when you finally have time for you. (client affirms) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">You should be roller-skating!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t know what to do with myself!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Good! We\u2019ll talk about it! (both laugh heartily)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: I really don\u2019t!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: But... but... you know, so how old are your sons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Ah, 23 and 19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Oh, good! (client laughs) You know, so now is a great time to have... Do you know what the word existential means? (client denies) It kind of... when we look at lives and go, \u201cWhoa! What\u2019s my purpose? What\u2019s my meaning? What \/blocked\/(inaudible).\u201d (client affirms) Okay, but you finally have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">time to have what we call an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d! Yay! Right? Yours got delayed, because you were so busy, surviving and taking care of everybody else. You finally get to have one!

(client affirms) So, you know, I don\u2019t... You look at this, and you see where you should have been. I look, and I\u2019m seeing there is no way you could be there. It\u2019s by your own strength, the grace of God, your faith, and your ability to survive.

It\u2019s like, I get a lot of people who tell me, saying, \u201cYou cannot save the world.\u201d I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s I\u2019m trying to do. I just feel like if someone that I know or... (and I don\u2019t even have to have known <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">you all that long), but if I have the opportunity to meet you, and I think that you\u2019re a really nice person, or whatever, and something was to go wrong with you, I\u2019m willing to help, you know, and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: What about you, though? Remember, I asked you, \u201cWhere were you in all of this?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Where\u2019s your pat on the back for a job well done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: (pause) My GPA?

You\u2019re telling me this painful story, where you, you know, somehow found it, you know, in your schedule to be able to take classes to be an LPN. You are clearly very bright, because there is no <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">way you could have pulled all that together. All right, not just for the LPN, but I mean your whole life, of knowing, right? You\u2019ve got great survival skills! You\u2019ve had to bear more than a human being should have to bear, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">But, you know, to know to go to the doctor, how to take care of your sisters, when to go to adults, when, how to take care of your mom, all that stuff. Okay, that involves lots of emotional strength and smarts, right? So, again, last week, you know, you are bright, but you haven\u2019t figured out just how <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">bright you are, you know? You know there is something there (client affirms), but you don\u2019t know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: ...what! Like, how to bring it all together!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Right! Yes. Exactly. And that\u2019s because you haven\u2019t had a chance to be consistently validated, because school has always been interrupted. (client affirms) Okay? Right. So you finally, you know, take this test and that man, you have that racist incident, where he is, you know, basically...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: ...in my ear, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yes! In your ear, in your head, criminalizing you, basically positioning (ph) you and it messed with your head!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah! Big time! I mean, it still does!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s a very painful thing. And that threw you off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Oh, it threw me so far off, because... I think what it was, you know, I tried not to let him, you know, consume me like that. (therapist affirms) But at the same time, I said okay, well, I thought it was me. I said, \u201cWell, maybe I need to brush up,\u201d you know and everything. So I gather all my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">books and everything, and I\u2019m on the computer, and I\u2019m just studying and studying, you know, to the point where now I feel like I can\u2019t even concentrate, you know. Then I said, \u201cWell, is this what I really want?\u201d You know, now I\u2019m, you know, really with the questioning myself and you know stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">I called, I said, \u201cWell, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m not going to take the test over at Ohio anymore, since that\u2019s where I went to school. I\u2019ll try to take it over at Wisconsin.\u201d I called the Wisconsin Department of Regulations and they said, \u201cWell, how long has it been?\u201d I told them, you know, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">duration of the time and they said, \u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s been a little too long.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, okay. Is there a refresher course that I can maybe take? Then I\u2019ll take the State Board.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, no. Actually, you\u2019re going to have to re-do the program all over again.\u201d And I said, \u201cWait a minute! <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201032\">Who has money for that? You know, who has time for that?\u201d Because now I feel like, \u201cWhy would I go back?\u201d You know, I would take my time, if I wanted to go back to school, and I\u2019m going to move forward. I just have to find something different to do. You know, and I think that\u2019s how I ended up here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: So that cost you. That incident with him and monitoring you during the test cost you confidence, time, energy, and money.

I refuse to quit!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: But, yeah. So what is that in you, because you never do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Um, I think it\u2019s because I know I have the potential to be something just extraordinary!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: And where does that come from for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: And... I don\u2019t know! (both chuckle) I mean, I think it comes from... I want to make my family proud of me. You know, and I tell you, I think I\u2019ve been to a couple of funerals, and when I hear the obituary, it\u2019s so sad. To me, the obituary is worse than the person that\u2019s laying in the casket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Tell me about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: You know, as the obituary is being read and there are nothing said about the person. You have all these words on this piece of paper and it has no meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: What strikes you about that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: I feel like God put us here for a purpose. I don\u2019t want to be the type of person that\u2019s just sitting here, taking up space, you\u2019re irrelevant. You know... you\u2019re just here when someone else, they\u2019ve probably been, I don\u2019t know, aborted, just because somebody wanted to take it and use it as a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">form of birth control and they could have, you know, sat there in that space and did something good with it. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">I mean, I think, I don\u2019t know why I think like that, but I just... I don\u2019t want, when my obituary is being read, and there is nothing said about all the years I\u2019ve been here on this earth, you know, and then you have your children sitting there, your grandchildren, you know, what have you. And they <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201191\">say, \u201cMan! You know, Mama hasn\u2019t done nothing!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Well, what is it you want it to say? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: Well, I want it to say that Yvette was hard working, you know, dedicated. She was a good person. You know, she was always there to lend a hand, no matter what the case may have been, you know. She was creative. You know, she devised this and she created that, because we don\u2019t have any of that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">in our family. So, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOkay. If it starts with one person, maybe it could be like a trickledown effect? More like a domino effect and it just knock other people in the direction of something good!\u201d You know what I mean? As opposed to people just sitting around, and they\u2019ll be smoking weed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D2\">drink all day, you know, stay up all night and sleep all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2011C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">I mean you know, to me, I... and... my sisters, they call me (chuckles) they call me \u201cthe philosophier (ph).\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m always telling them, \u201cLook, okay, you know, get up, do something with yourself!\u201d You know. \u201cDon\u2019t just sit here!\u201d I have two of my sisters out of the three are doing so wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: I remember you telling me that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: You know, yeah. The one sister, oh my gosh! She is bright! I mean, was honor roll when she graduated high school and everything. I\u2019m just trying to get her to set one foot in college. If you just step through the door, you know, and you\u2019ll feel different, and you\u2019ll look at your surroundings <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">and you know, maybe it would change or spark something, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: There is, you know, there is so much that\u2019s striking me right now.

(client chuckles) Now, I hear the second part of the obituary are the things that you want to do (client affirms) and the things that you want to be (client affirms). Then I heard the third part is, you want to be a role model for your family (client <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">affirms) so that they can see something different. (client affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">So the first part is already on lock (ph). That\u2019s who you are, right? The second part is in motion, because it\u2019s the things that you want to do.

(client sighs) Tell me what you\u2019re feeling now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah, because... that\u2019s the truth.

I feel like, okay, when it... You know, we never know when our demise is, you know, going to come, but when I feel like when mine comes, I want to... Well, I guess I really wouldn\u2019t know anyway, because I\u2019ll be dead, but... I mean, you know, just to know that, even if I was to take sick, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">you know, and I couldn\u2019t do anything, you know, for anybody anymore, they could take care of themselves.

And your neighborhood?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: (sighs) Oh, well, when I was... about... nine, I would say, we moved to what I thought was a pretty nice neighborhood from the projects. So to me, I guess...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2013C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Which projects?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: Um... 38th and Ellis, was that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: 38th and Ellis, Ida B.

Then I began to meet and make, you know, make friends and everything. It was so nice and stuff. You know, we had a big backyard and you know, you could <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201491\">just run around and my mom wasn\u2019t on drugs then. (therapist affirms) You know, so stuff was good and it was like so many of us living in the house, just for so many years. I\u2019d say about maybe 13 people, (therapist affirms) you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">And it was basically like myself, my sisters, my mom, my aunt, her two boys, my grandma and granddad, my uncle (who would have seizures all the time, because he was an alcoholic then), then another uncle and... oh, yeah, then the other set of cousins, it was like four of them. You know, there was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B1\">so many of us. You know, you\u2019d even have to fight for your food and... I mean, you know, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: And were these happy memories for you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Oh... for the most part, during my early... I would say, when we first moved there, yeah, it was nice. But then, when I turned ten, I can remember it like the back of my hand. It was like 1980... was it 1980? No, like 1982. I could remember, that\u2019s when my mom started with the drugs and stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">She started slacking off, you know, things that she would do. You know, like giving the girls a bath and stuff like that, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">My sister fell down and busted her Achilles tendon and my mom wouldn\u2019t take her to the doctor. So it became infected and all that, you know? Just like... little things here and there and stuff. Then my grandma and granddad would have to argue with her, because she would sneak a boyfriend in. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201511\">try to feed him before she fed her kids. So then grandma and granddad got tired, because they had to make sure that everybody had money for lunch and, you know, stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: So they picked up the slack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Oh, they picked up so much of the slack; Oh, my God! Mom and... Grandma and granddad were my mom and dad, you know. That\u2019s why I take such good care of my granddad, because that\u2019s my daddy, you know? My grandmother passed away in 2010 and you know, a lot of things, she was so strong, though, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201551\">you know. She battled two different types of cancer and nobody knew it, but her and my granddad, her sister and children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">You know, just to see, even when she had the leukemia in the end, you know, she didn\u2019t want any oxygen. This lady was sitting up, trying to... trying to conduct a conversation with my cousin, and she couldn\u2019t even breathe! You know, she was holding herself up with her arms and, I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! Grandma!\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201571\">You know, I just started putting her shoes on and, without thinking, I should have never moved her. I should have just dialed 911. But it\u2019s like my instinct just kicked in and something just said, \u201cGet her to the hospital! You can move faster than an ambulance. You have to first wait until they get <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201572\">here and she needs to go now,\u201d you know. I ended up having to do CPR on her, on Easter Sunday. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20156-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20156-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: Oh, Yvette!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah, because, Oh, my God! Trying to get her to the car and her legs gave out. We put her on the couch. I told them, \u201cTake off everything at the top, to give her some air,\u201d you know, just... And she just stopped breathing. You know, so yeah, then we did the CPR, she came back and I thanked God, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B1\">the ambulance was walking right through the door. You know, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: So, you saved her life in that moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yes! And I thought she was mad at me. You know, because I remember she would say, \u201cWell, you know my mom, when she passed, she wanted to die around all of her family.\u201d That Easter Sunday, a lot of us was there, you know. It\u2019s like she held on for certain things, and I felt like that Sunday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F1\">she waited for me to get there, you know, because she was trying to give me these papers that the hospital gave her before I took her to the hospital. I knew she didn\u2019t want to be... revived. She said that. But then, here I go, and I\u2019m doing CPR! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but in some ways, how could you not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: I know!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: You know, could you really not??<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: You know, and then, well, we went to the hospital, she was able to still communicate, she just couldn\u2019t talk. She was on a ventilator, but she could hear you, and she\u2019d nod her head and everything. I had to ask her, I said, \u201cMom, are you mad at me for doing the CPR?\u201d She shook her head \u201cno,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201671\">and it was like a big relief off of my chest, because I said, \u201cGod! I did what she didn\u2019t want me to do.\u201d And I never defy my grandparents, you know, or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: Okay! Wow! Let\u2019s stop. (client sighs) You are beating yourself up for saving her life, just for the moment, because that\u2019s instinct. You know, she, in some ways, taught you that. (client affirms) Her, you know, she\u2019s trying to talk to your cousin, and she can\u2019t talk. So her fighting spirit <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201691\">to live... what were you supposed to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: I know! That\u2019s why I... I couldn\u2019t just sit there and not do anything. You know, everybody, out of everybody in the house, everybody! Nobody knew CPR! Nobody knew what, and I just kept thanking God, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just so glad that I was there...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Goodness, Yvette! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">CLIENT: You know, because they said, \u201cMan, \u2018Cuz,\u2019 you just went right into mo\u2019 and you saved her!\u201d You know, and I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cBut out of all the people there, that\u2019s here, nobody knew anything!\u201d I had to tell them, \u201cSomebody grab Dad, and sit him down!\u201d You know, I had to like navigate everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">THERAPIST: So you had to manage the family while you were doing CPR! (client affirms) Have you ever stopped (because these are all, what you\u2019re describing from your miscarriage, to your early pregnancies, to your own surgeries, to saving your grandma), these are all traumas. Do you know what a trauma is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">CLIENT: Uh... if I could sum up trauma in one word, I would say... Well, I guess I can\u2019t do it in one word! You know, but, if I had to pick one, I would have to say... Tiring! (chuckles) I mean, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s... it\u2019s pain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah. It\u2019s now, it\u2019s, but it\u2019s, these are life-changing, deeply painful events that forever change who you are and leave their mark on you. You\u2019ve had them, one after the other after the other after the other after the other; which is one, why you\u2019re exhausted; two, why you\u2019re always <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201751\">in crisis mode, right? Because you\u2019ve described these sorts of... You came in today and described these incidents, and you\u2019re sort of like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of the way it always is.\u201d I\u2019m imagining that that is exactly true. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s been since you were eight or nine (client affirms), and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201752\">it hasn\u2019t stopped.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20174-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20174-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20177\">CLIENT: No!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">THERAPIST: And now that it looks like things may be slowing down a bit, you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah! I mean, it\u2019s like... Okay, then I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWell, the kids are grown (chuckles) now!\u201d I mean, you know, so really, what do I do with myself? And then, like I told you before, I find myself, when I got here, the environment is just so different. You know, and the people, you know? The <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B1\">positive-ness. You know, that type of vibe, and it makes me feel like I can do anything. I\u2019m ready to almost try like, almost anything! (therapist affirms) Not even knowing what it is that I really... really want to do for myself, but just to, just go with the flow, and whatever door opens, I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B2\">step in, as long as it\u2019s positive, and some good can come out of it, you know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m willing to try. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D\">THERAPIST: But in some ways, what you put into the environment, hopefully in some ways, comes back to you.

(client affirms) Yes, but if you had walked through with a different attitude, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D1\">wouldn\u2019t, you know, so you talked last week about a professor who said, \u201cI got my eye on you!\u201d Because she knows that you can do it! Yes! How embracing that felt, because life hasn\u2019t always done that for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah! That felt so good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20181\">THERAPIST: But that started with you. (pause) You have a hard time with that, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20183\">CLIENT: (pause) Maybe. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">THERAPIST: What are you feeling right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">CLIENT: (pause) I feel like I\u2019m very... (crying, sigh) I feel like I\u2019m very proud of myself, you know, because I\u2019m at a (sniffles), I\u2019m at a place that I\u2019ve never been in before, and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">THERAPIST: And that place is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">CLIENT: A place of goodness, you know. I feel like it\u2019s just serene, it\u2019s calming. I feel like... for so many years, I didn\u2019t know who I was. (crying) (pause) And now I\u2019m getting a chance to see that there is more to me than, you know, what I was doing before. It\u2019s so much more to me and things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B1\">I never thought I could do, I see that it\u2019s possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Yes! Yes! Abso\/stops\/, well, not only that, but I think you underestimate the impact of your environment on you, you know. Growing up in poverty, right? Growing up black. (client sniffles) Growing up where you\u2019re surrounded by drugs and a lack of role models has a huge, huge impact, huge <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D1\">impact, right? So, for example, my parents were teachers. You\u2019re familiar with the local high schools? (client affirms) Okay, my dad and mom taught there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">CLIENT: Oh, wow! Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">THERAPIST: Okay. But they were teachers, so you know, it was always assumed I would go to college.

But you had all of these significant things you had to take care of, from the time you were a little, little girl. I got a <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019D1\">chance just to be ten. You had to take care of mom, help your grandparents, watch your sisters, deal with crisis and trauma. That has a huge, huge impact and it\u2019s unfair, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F\">But if we would have switched places, you are no less determined than I am, and you\u2019re certainly not less smart than I am, not in any, any way, not in any way, right? But the... no! Not in any way! (client chuckles) Okay, but the difference is, right, you grew up in an environment that was oppressing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F1\">scary, unpredictable, deeply painful, (client affirms) right? And you didn\u2019t get a chance to be a kid, right? (client affirms) I didn\u2019t have to deal with those burdens. So when those things are lifted, right? And you just get a chance to be a kid, it\u2019s a world of difference, and yet... you\u2019re still <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F2\">here, you\u2019re still very smart, very determined, and you get a chance now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A1\">It\u2019s unfair, but you keep underestimating the impact that all of these very tough, traumatic life circumstances have had on your life, so I do think we have to do some trauma work. Yet, in spite of it all, you have this positive attitude and amazing strength. You keep sort of, you kind of recognize <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A11\">it, but not really. It\u2019s kind of like, \u201cOh, yeah, yeah. That\u2019s the way it has to be, so now I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m behind!\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you serious??\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I (chuckles), I really feel like I am so far behind!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">THERAPIST: No, Yvette! Because what was the choice you were going to make? Right? What, leave your family behind? (client denies) No! And you took great care of them. It\u2019s time; everybody\u2019s grown, though, now! (client confirms everybody) So, it\u2019s time that everybody takes care of themselves, and you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A51\">been pretty instrumental in giving them some tools. It is your turn. It is your turn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A7\">CLIENT: And, you know, I feel like that, and I tell myself that, \u201cThis is my turn now.\u201d I want to keep that determination, you know. I can\u2019t let that slip through my fingers. I\u2019ve always been competitive, you know. I thank God for JROTC in high school and for a teacher I will never forget, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A71\">Kelly Church. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">She was the Head of the Math Department and she saw something in me that I just thought wasn\u2019t there, but I thought maybe she could see... pieces... Oh, how could I say it? Maybe she could see that I was bringing some of the problems from home to school...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Which anybody would do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">CLIENT: I would come to school hungry, you know and stuff. She would have these huge, (chuckles) huge candy bars, you know. I said, \u201cDog! I want one of those!\u201d But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ask. You know, so... I said, \u201cHmm.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you have to do to earn one of those candy bars?\u201d She was <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD1\">like, \u201cYou see that brainteaser up there on the board? You have to solve it.\u201d And I couldn\u2019t get it. I just could not get it. I said, \u201cDog! I\u2019m not smart enough to do nothing!\u201d You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201AF\">One day I was so hungry, I sat there and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving! (therapist chuckles) I\u2019m going to solve this friggin\u2019 teaser!\u201d You know? When I got it, she was like, \u201cPick any one you want!\u201d I said, \u201cWow!\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s all I had to do! It will take me the whole class period (chuckles), but...\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201AF1\">You know... Eventually, I would practice and practice and I would solve those brainteasers (snapping fingers) you know, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Get another candy bar! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah! You know? And then, I was, I think my grade in her class was like a D? No, close to an F. I believe I did get an F, you know, a couple of times. I told myself, I said, \u201cNaw, you can\u2019t get F\u2019s. You can\u2019t make it in life with F\u2019s,\u201d you know? So, I said \u201cOkay.\u201d I had, well I think she noticed <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201B31\">that she had to find a different way to work with me with the math. The way that she did it, oh man, I could get it (snapping fingers) just like that, you know? Those D\u2019s and F\u2019s became B\u2019s and now A\u2019s, to the point that I was doing it on the computer for fun! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B5\">You know, and then she gave me a job. She said, \u201cHow would you like to work for me? You tutor Algebra, and I\u2019ll pay you $50 every two weeks.\u201d I looked! Me? You know, and I was like, \u201cYeah! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B7\">THERAPIST: So when you said you couldn\u2019t do math, that wasn\u2019t true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B9\">CLIENT: (pause) I guess not!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BB\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BD\">CLIENT: You know... Well, see, it appeared to be so, because I was having a hard time with, I guess...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BF\">THERAPIST: So, the end results are like, is you, it\u2019s always you. If something goes wrong, it\u2019s you. (client affirms) Even though people look at you, in ten minutes of interacting with you, and recognize how talented you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, but why can\u2019t I see that in that minutes? (both chuckle) I mean, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C3\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re going to get to that! I just, you know, I am wondering out loud here, if you have a learning disability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C5\">CLIENT: (whispers) I was wondering that! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Let\u2019s look at some resources. I\u2019m going to refer you to Sally Rubin. She\u2019s the Director of Disabilities. You know, I have family members who have learning disabilities. You know, they\u2019re very common and typically, the profile of someone who has a learning disability is somebody who <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C71\">is very bright, who learns differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C9\">You know, you know dyslexia, where you see words backwards and things like that? There are different kinds of learning disabilities, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not smart. It means you learn differently. I myself, Lord knows, I\u2019ve had so many struggles with math. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s due to a learning <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C91\">disability (client chuckles), I just struggled, struggled, struggled, struggled with math. It can be a painful experience, but you\u2019re very smart. This has nothing to do with not being smart. You just learn differently. Once you figure out the way that you learn... and some of you already knows this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C92\">Okay, you\u2019ve had some very successful school experiences. Once you figure out how you learn, right? Then you can maximize how you learn, as opposed to learning in a way that doesn\u2019t work for you. So, it\u2019s not a, I don\u2019t, you know, I guess we can look more into it. It doesn\u2019t sound like a memory issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N201C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201CB\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201CD\">THERAPIST: No. Right? And you know what? If you struggle with memory, you can write things down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201CF\">CLIENT: I can write things down, and then... you know, okay. I write a lot of poems. It\u2019s like, whatever comes to my mind, I just like to have a pencil and piece of paper, I just like write it down. Now, if you asked me, \u201cYvette, can you say one of those?\u201d Because my cousin just asked me this over the <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201CF1\">weekend. He said, \u201cYou write a lot of poetry and stuff, and I like it!\u201d He said, \u201cCould you recite one of your poems?\u201d I looked at him and I just fell down laughing! You know, I said, \u201cYou know, I write the stuff and can\u2019t remember what I wrote!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D1\">THERAPIST: But why do you take that in, that there is something wrong with you because you can\u2019t remember what you wrote? I can\u2019t remember what I said five minutes ago!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D3\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Yes! I can\u2019t... If I... You know, if I wrote a paper on something, I can\u2019t remember what I wrote! But if you asked me to look at it, I can look at it and go, \u201cOh, yeah! I remember this! This is kind of the main idea.\u201d (client repeatedly affirms) If you do a lot of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D7\">CLIENT: That\u2019s normal? (both laugh) I mean... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Yes, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I mean, we should look into the learning disability issue, but why do you put it on you, that you\u2019re supposed to remember every word that you ever wrote?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201DB\">CLIENT: You know, I think because... okay, I\u2019ve seen people and they can actually...

No! (client responds) And why do I have to? Why do you have to remember your poems? If someone wants to hear you read a poem, just go get your poem and read it off the piece of paper! Why do you have to know that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201EF\">CLIENT: Oh, I, you know, I always felt that if you wrote it, you should know what you wrote, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Well, you know you wrote it!

(client affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20207\">So you, going back to your solving the math problem. You know, some teachers, in the way that they teach, they teach in rigid ways. You have to do it these ways. Okay, and don\u2019t ask me about math, but... But see, the thing is, you came up with the right answer. Quite possibly, a better teacher would <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202071\">go, \u201cOkay, Yvette.

I know how to read maps, but sometimes, for me to get the right direction, I have to flip the map upside down. (therapist responds) You know? Then I could tell you, \u201cOh, shoot!

(client chuckles) I can\u2019t, in any of my teaching or learning, I never look <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202231\">at the map, I never look at the graph.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N20222-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20222-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20225\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20227\">THERAPIST: It makes absolutely no sense to me. It confuses me. So if I were to ask you for directions, you say, \u201cLet me draw you a map,\u201d I\u2019ll say, \u201cDon\u2019t draw me a map. Write me the words, or tell me and I\u2019ll write it out.\u201d (client affirms) Okay? Because I\u2019m not a visual learner. That\u2019s useless. I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202271\">confused. No, I can\u2019t read a map, I\u2019m not kidding. MapQuest is the best thing that ever happened, because I just print out the directions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20229\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2022B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t look at the map part. (client affirms) But you are a visual learner, so you create in your head a picture of what it looks like, okay? I can\u2019t do that. (pause) (client responds) Not in any way. I\u2019m not kidding!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2022D\">CLIENT: So... (pause) Okay, I thought it had to be one or the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Nope! It\u2019s a combination of many things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20231\">CLIENT: Ohhh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20233\">THERAPIST: You have this idea, kind of as we end today, let me summarize this. You have this idea of who you\u2019re supposed to be and how you\u2019re supposed to learn and it has to be this way, or you\u2019re not smart. That\u2019s not true, and it\u2019s not how your mind works. Your mind works in some amazing ways, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202331\">you have to figure out exactly how your mind works, and then play to that, learn that way, right? So, I know that I cannot, one, I can\u2019t do math in my head unless it has to do with money, and then I\u2019m pretty good at it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20235\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking maybe that\u2019s how I am! I\u2019m... (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20237\">THERAPIST: Yes. Because money is real. The word problems of going to the store to pick up...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20239\">CLIENT: I hate the word problems!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but if you make it about money, it\u2019s easy for you, right? So somehow, you\u2019re able to learn all of this medical stuff, apply it in a crisis, know that getting medical care for your siblings is appropriate, develop particular life skills, all right? Understand that school is a value, <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2023B1\">go to school. This speaks to somebody who is very bright! Extremely bright, as well as motivated and competitive. These are great, great skills. That\u2019s who you are! That\u2019s who you are!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2023D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2023F\">THERAPIST: Yes! Okay? So now we just have to add the component of, how do you learn, right? You know some of how you learn, because you know you learn. Get rid of these ideas of, you know, you\u2019re not smart if you can\u2019t recite a poem from memory. Who cares? You don\u2019t have to recite no poem from memory! <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2023F1\">You just pull out the poem you wrote and read it! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20241\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, this makes so much sense! (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20243\">THERAPIST: Yeah! So how are you doing, as we end today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20245\">CLIENT: Um, I think I\u2019m doing okay. I brought something I wanted to show you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20247\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20249\">CLIENT: And this is just like a part of what, you know, things that I do, like when I have spare time? I remember I was telling you about it. Okay. This is like a small little portfolio I want to start, it\u2019s an idea that I came up with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2024D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t, I know that it\u2019s not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2024F\">THERAPIST: Whoa! So, wait. (high-pitched, surprised) Did you do this? (client affirms) Good Lord! (client chuckles) You have a mission statement... (client affirms) Okay, and this is just on your own, not for a class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20251\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That\u2019s an idea that I came up with, that I would like to... get critiqued and, you know, have it professionalized, where I could sell the idea, probably. And then I have another idea... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N20250-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20250-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561260\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20253\">THERAPIST: Wait.

It\u2019s, you know, I see a lot of women, they ride around in these cars, they look like cars for men, because they\u2019re trying to feminize the car, but it\u2019s just impossible. (therapist affirms) You know. You could have the most gorgeous woman stepping out of this masculine-looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202551\">car. So I said, \u201cWell, what if I could come up with something that\u2019s different. You know, for women.\u201d I don\u2019t really want to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20257\">THERAPIST: You did a SWOT analysis...

Because, see I came up with that idea because I was helping my cousin, before I even started here, I was helping her with an assignment she had to do, because she\u2019s in Human Resource Management?
