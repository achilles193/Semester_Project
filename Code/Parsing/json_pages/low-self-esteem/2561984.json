...surprised [to see me.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, quite surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: [Oh my God.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: So how are you doing? How was your week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Pretty Good. Yeah. Just was hoping that there would be a little bit more time this morning to have spent a little prep time. Like, \u201cOkay, where am I at? What am I going to say?\u201d And it is like, \u201cYeah. No, here I am.\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. There is never as much of that as we would want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So I am just kind of reeling back to, did I make the decision to take the GRE last week? Did I tell you I was doing the GRE? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: No. You decided to not do the doc program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Oh. Right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So I think where I am at this week from whatever events, not that there were that many events, yeah, I made the decision. And it is like, yeah. I am going to go. I will go take the GRE. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And it is like now I have to pony up 180 bucks to do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Is it 180 now? Oh goodness!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: So it is like, okay, I am at 180 bucks if I decide. Whatever. So I am going to go do that. I will go ahead and fill out the rest of the application forms. It looks like, and maybe we have had this discussion, but it kind of looks like kind of what they are anticipating or hoping that I am going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">to do is to go ahead and apply for this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Okay. For the masters or the doctoral program?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: The doctoral program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: And then I would be admitted into the doc program and I would be finishing up my master\u2019s degree classes as prereqs to the doctorate. The doc program. Which makes them more expensive. So I am still trying to figure out, okay, so why wouldn\u2019t I wait until next year to apply for the doc program? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Okay. Why wouldn\u2019t you wait until -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. But that is like a question that I need to have answered. You know, Dr. Fred is saying, \u201cWell, there are advantages to doing this.\u201d And I think that there is clearly the people that sign up for the doc program and get involved in it, you know, are less likely or more likely to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">complete it or to stick with it or whatever. I don\u2019t know. (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Okay. So you think that they are telling you you have a pretty good shot so you might as well. That is what it is sounding like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she said, it sounded like they would be able to set me up with at least a half time assistanceship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Which would cover the cost difference. But I am like, well maybe if I get in and they will figure out how to find me a full time assistanceship and then I don\u2019t have to worry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Sure. So you changed your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Really? That was where we left it last week? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well last week I think you decided to go ahead and finish up the master\u2019s degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Well that is definitely going to have to be part of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: So would you do a praticum and internship at the masters level?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Because unless they are figuring that, you know, whatever practicum But I am thinking that a practicum at the doc level would be different than a practicum at the master\u2019s degree level.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: It is from what I know about it because they are looking for different things because most people who go through the program already are either licensed therapists or have some, you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Experience. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: You know you can apply, get in and decide to delay your admission for a year if you wanted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that is not what they are wanting me to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: No. It sounds like they want you to kind of go forward. I mean, how do you feel about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I think I feel okay about that, you know, in that it is like, well, nothing really changes all that much. And as long as I am getting, you know, at the end of this they are awarding me a master\u2019s degree so that I can get my LPC, so that I can be working while I am also doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: You know, I would like to be working toward the LCPC or getting hours toward that. So as long as I am able to do that. And if things work out and if life circumstances work out differently and I can\u2019t complete the doc program, at least I have got the master\u2019s degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Sure. I think there is really no losing here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: So kind of whatever decision that you make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Now I know for the doc program for people who already have their LCPC they are pretty flexible about what it is comprised of. You always want to make sure that you have the number of hours you need and you are supervised by either an LCPC or somebody like myself who has a clinical licensure <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">through being a psychologist, that you get those hours supervised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And as long as you get those hours supervised by an appropriately licensed professional you will be fine. So it is kind of a win, win either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: It really doesn\u2019t make a difference. You know, I got my master\u2019s degree along the way in the doctoral program. So most people at Phoenix don\u2019t do it that way but it doesn\u2019t really matter. So if they are saying, \u201cHey, we really want you in the doc program,\u201d that is a really good sign I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">that, you know, you have a strong chance on getting in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: And I have heard they are going to take a bigger class next year to make up for some of the enrollment deficits of maybe some of the students who have dropped out. Because typically doctoral programs are smaller and maybe they want you to be a part of that class. So that is impressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think, though, that I really wouldn\u2019t start the cohort until Fall of \u201815.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: So it would be, you know, I would still have an entire year yet before I would start a cohort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Sure. How do you feel about all this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: You know, it was disorienting at first. You know, some different feelings. It was a little disorienting then, you know, kind of went down that path of wanting to dismiss it. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: And then kind of like, \u201cWell, this feels really good.\u201d You know? And then I am kind of wanting to check that. And it is like, let\u2019s make this decision based on something other than, \u201cOoh, this feels really good.\u201d You know? So I think, you know, it has maybe evened out a little bit more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: And now I do have another group. I don\u2019t know if I have mentioned this group of guys that we get together every four to six weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: No. I don\u2019t think you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: And it is an intentional group. I was invited to be a part of it. And it was started by a guy that I knew from kind of early on just out of undergrad. Yeah, someplace back then. We have known each other off and on for a long time. And he has got his PhD in psychology. And when we first got married <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">he put together an intentional young families group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: So we would get together about once every four to six weeks and talk about young family issues, raising kids. And then that group kind of died out for one reason or another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Because you were raising young families with kids. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, I think that there was really a nasty divorce. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Oh, goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: And one of the group members that kind of precipitated the end of that. (sigh) So this group is guys that, the other two guys in the group are counselors and I was invited to be a part of this group because he knew that I was getting into counseling. So it was a nice mix. So I am the youngest <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">guy in the group, you know, so it is nice to have the experience of these other guys. So it was a nice change to kind of air this idea with them and we kind of talked it through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: So, yeah, I sort of feel now I am kind of in this place of it does seem like it is just one of those situations where it is really difficult to find the cons. You know there is a lot of pros about this and not so many cons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well, more time. But you don\u2019t mind that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: A little more time and a little bit more money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And since you don\u2019t really mind that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: And right now it doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: That could change any day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Have you told your wife about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Tell me her thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: I think she has been fine with it. I would say it may be an issue if she wasn\u2019t so closely connected to her best friend. But they spend all of their waking hours together anyway. So. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: So, tell me about that. I detect some sarcasm there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: Well, yes and no. I mean, I feel like there is less pressure for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: You know, thinking about this program because this semester I am up here three nights out of the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: You know, and I am up here most days. Well that wouldn\u2019t really affect here. But, you know, three nights out of the week I am up here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: It stings though, doesn\u2019t it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: No, I am really okay with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Because if I wasn\u2019t here I would likely be at home alone.

You know, I go back and forth on that. And I really, you know, I am able to see. You know, it is like I can look at it this way, that I recognize that this is still an issue and I know that I still need to continue to work with this issue because it is going to constantly be there for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C91\">me as a counselor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: The issue with your wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">CLIENT: So I recognize that there is still a sense of being unsettled. But I am also in this other place of recognizing, yeah, you know, I can create this universe however I want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: You know, I can look at it this way or I can look at it this way. And if I spend a lot of time dwelling on this then I go down that road of being angry, frustrated, upset, mildly depressed. I get all of those kinds of things. And I am like, \u201cYeah, do you see what you did there.\u201d You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: But that stuff is still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Oh, it is there but, you know, it is also recognizing that And I know that I am filtering some of the language of choice theory on this. But it is like it is a choice. I can go there or I can go with a different -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Well they coexist together in the same universe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: You know, there are a lot of positive things happening for you. You know, you are excelling in this academic area where your professors have really looked at you and said, \u201cHey, we want to continue to educate you.\u201d You know? I mean that is impressive. And are encouraging you to apply even <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">before you finish the master\u2019s program. So that is great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">But then there is still some of this old stuff there, you know, that in some ways it makes it less of a hassle because your wife is spending so much time with her best friend that you don\u2019t really have to consider her needs in this. But on the other hand, it means she is still not really considering yours. Toughie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I know that that is there. I know that there is a sense, you know (pause) Yeah, that I am sure that if we had that conversation -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: You and she.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: She and I. If we had that conversation her world view would be, you know, I am projecting, that she is doing everything that she can to spend time with me and showing me all these different ways that she cares about me and those kinds of things. And I recognize that, yeah, in her universe I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">am sure that that is 100 percent correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">But in terms of knowing each other, you know, really spending time. You know, \u201cDo I really know you?\u201d kind of things. It is like, yeah, I think we probably both suck at that pretty much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. What would you like to, if anything You know, we spent a lot of time kind of in our earlier work looking at those pieces. We have moved away from looking at those pieces. What would you like to do with them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. I have thought about that one too. You know, it is like the inclination from years of habitual energy, the inclination is to avoid it, to ignore it. And now I feel like, well, yeah, how much (pause) So I think that I am pushing against that inclination and recognizing that, yeah, as <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED1\">a professional I am going to be asking other people to do that kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">And it is like So I know that But I feel In this situation I feel stuck. You know. I feel stuck in those old habitual patterns. I don\u2019t feel that I can\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t feel like I can\u2019t figure this out. But I know that I feel stuck. And I know that, yeah, yeah. (pause) It is an interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF1\">You know, it is interesting. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: We go there and it is like, hmmm, yeah. It is like the brain shuts down. It is like I don\u2019t want to go there. I don\u2019t want to think about it. Boom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: In some ways I am kind of torn with you because I still see it as a very painful issue.

If I can just pull myself out of the box of the shoulds and woulds and all of those kinds of things and just put myself into that place, into that fictional place, that fantasy place, it is like, well, I think today the answer would be, \u201cYeah.\u201d You know, the whole marriage commitment <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201011\">thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah, whoever came up with that idea? That is not good. I don\u2019t like that anymore. So we will be done with that. And, you know, I am kind of liking this not being, you know, in this role of being a student again. And it is like, yeah, I kind of like the freedom of all of that. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: So are you saying that in your ideal world you would not be with your wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean if I can really just suspend -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Suspend it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: If I could just suspend all of the language.

But you made that commitment.\u201d You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: So too bad, you know, you are locked in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: But your thoughts don\u2019t match that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, and it is like, well, what have you got? What have you got? Is it really bad enough that you would want to call it quits. You know, really. What is so terrible? So I mean there is a number of all of those different voices coming. It is just so against all the past tapes that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201191\">it is like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Tell me about the tapes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: My folks.

I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t seem You know, they seem to get along well enough together. But, yeah, in terms of how much do they actually connect? You know, do they know You know, it is like they are roommates living in a house. You know, it is like, \u201cI\u2019ll do my thing. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201251\">do your thing.\u201d And, well, I don\u2019t know. They do some stuff together. But I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: You feel like it sort of mirrors your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think, yeah. You know, in that need of mine to connect with somebody. To feel like I have actually got somebody that is listening to me. You know, might be even moderately interested to know something about me. You know, those kind of feelings. And it is like, yeah, I am not sure I see <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201291\">that in their relationship. You know? It is kind of like they repeat each other\u2019s stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Sure. But how connected are they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">CLIENT: You know, it is like, \u201cWe have got a history together and we can share that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: And, \u201cWe have got kids together and we can share that.\u201d But in terms of, you know, anything Maybe their needs Maybe they don\u2019t care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: And what about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: And that is great for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: But it is not okay with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t seem to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: And what about sex?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: (sigh, pause) You know, again, another Yeah, another issue. It is just like, yeah. And I feel that. You know? (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">CLIENT: I feel that frustration of \u201cDamn it!\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: Damn it, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: You know, to be in that place or to be in this relationship where I am like (pause) great, so you know I can get myself mentally to this place where it is like, okay, I can wall myself off. And it is like I don\u2019t need to think about sex and I don\u2019t need to think about interpersonal relationships. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201451\">And I can just kind of section myself off for a little while. And then I feel like then there are times where it is just like you know that is not working real well for you because it leaks out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: Well sure. It is a real human need to touch and be touched and to physically be validated with your partner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: And so I feel like I am in this relationship where I feel like the condition of it is that we just don\u2019t go there. We don\u2019t talk about it. I am not trying to use any kind of blaming language because I recognize that we are both responsible for being in that position. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: But it is not okay with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: No. No. And it is just like, yeah, what do I feel? I feel trapped. What do I feel? Stuck. You know? What other words? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And divorce would be, and I am not at all trying to sort of try to convince you that divorce is the right option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">THERAPIST: I am just putting it, you know, kind of talking it through with you. But divorce is an absolute no no because? What are the messages you have received about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: Oh, I suppose I go immediately to the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">CLIENT: You know, it is like you have got to stay married for the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: But they are grown.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">CLIENT: Right. But you still got to stay married for the kids because whatever. And then the other thought is, regardless of how weak or dysfunctional our relationship is, it is like me trying to imagine her going through that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Going through what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT: Going through a divorce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">CLIENT: And it is like I am pretty sure she is not going to handle that real well. And, you know, I am making up that whole story knowing full well that people are very resilient and they can figure this out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. And how would it be for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, you know, yeah. I have had that experience of letting go of an earlier relationship where I was engaged to somebody for a couple of years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">CLIENT: And that was difficult to kind of initially go through. But after that it was just euphoric feelings of freedom. And I recognize that, well, am I just kind of reaching back for that. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">CLIENT: Well, it is like that is the only answer you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: You know, run away and you got rewarded for running away because you had this -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: Whoa! You are so hard on yourself. I don\u2019t think you ran away.

Right? And all while you distance yourself from how painful it is on a daily basis even if you are sort of not internalizing it anymore and throwing yourself into school.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: What would it be like for you to do something radical?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">CLIENT: (sighs, pause) I don\u2019t know. I think that I am probably moving to that place. You know, that there is a sense of this work, our work together, my feeling a renewed sense of some self-esteem about myself through the program here. That there is a sense of like, \u201cWell, you know what? Yeah. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A11\">don\u2019t need to continue doing this to yourself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">THERAPIST: You are an attractive, extremely bright, deeply sensitive, insightful man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">THERAPIST: And we don\u2019t know I mean, of course, you know better than I. But we don\u2019t know for sure where your wife is at because of the fear, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: And extreme anxiety of the wall that has built between the two of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: And there is something very terrifying for you about knowing whatever the truth is, even though everything about you seeks the truth. There is something scary about seeking the truth here because it could be as simple and I am not trying to simplify it because I think it is very complicated <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B31\">as saying, \u201cHoney, I am not happy and I want to be.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: \u201cAnd I would like to talk to you about that.\u201d Which is not about divorce, per se. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Maybe that is not an option. My parents separated when I was thirteen. They never got divorced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Never. Right? And actually after their parents started dying started to be friends again. You know, but it took years. And I am not suggesting that model either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">THERAPIST: I am just saying, if you have all of these negative feelings about divorce, right? You know, and I do feel like you are a man with a lot of love to give and are looking for that in one form or fashion. And somebody would love to do it. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">THERAPIST: I think you have to give yourself a shot at that whatever it looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: It may look like having conversations with your wife about what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Maybe it is about actually, genuinely trying to work on your relationship. Maybe it is about finally getting answers to know this isn\u2019t going to work. Or maybe it is about separating because you are pretty separated now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: And that is the loneliest piece. You know, to be living with somebody under the guise of being with somebody but not really being with somebody is a lonely, lonely, lonely, tough place to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: But you are not stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: No. And I think that I am feeling more and more in that place of like, yeah, you know, stuck is just a box that I put myself in. Stuck is just the story I am telling myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: But it is tough because I can see where you would feel stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Once you have so much history with someone and you don\u2019t want to rock the boat. And so I too in our work together am completely torn with you\u2019re on this great And I can sort of see your future career and you are going to be great at it. I can see it ahead of you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">THERAPIST: But what do you do then when you sit across from your clients or you sit across from your couples?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: I remember I told you my Dad was therapist and he was in the process of he and my Mom were separating. And he got asked about it. And he said, \u201cIt was painful for me but I was pretty honest.\u201d And, you know, he said, \u201cWe love each other. We don\u2019t like each other anymore. We just don\u2019t like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E71\">each other.\u201d And I think it was more complicated than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">So I guess I am saying, you don\u2019t have to stay in this place. And avoiding the hurt. It doesn\u2019t go anywhere. It is not wallowing in it to kind of take it out and process it. But your needs, your sexual and emotional needs, psychological needs, intellectual needs are healthy, important needs. And they <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E91\">can\u2019t be denied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">THERAPIST: And when you are being constantly validated over in one area it makes the other area that much more stark. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">THERAPIST: And you cannot change her behavior but you can certainly, you know, say, \u201cHoney, I am not happy and I really want to have some honest discussions with you.\u201d And at least have a start. And if it doesn\u2019t go anywhere and you keep trying well that is an answer too. I mean, what are your thoughts <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F11\">on what I am saying? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">CLIENT: I think I am (pause) You know, I think that there is part of me that is like, and I think we have explored this a little bit, but I am like I mean there is another part of me that is like, \u201cI am not sure I want to go there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Tell me about that part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">CLIENT: Because what if she actually wants to work on this? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FB\">CLIENT: It is like that is a whole lot of work I am not sure I want to do either. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">THERAPIST: So what would that be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">CLIENT: Well, then it is just kind of like, you know, you recognize that, yeah, my perspective on this is just one perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">CLIENT: You know, she has a perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">THERAPIST: So what if she does want to work on it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">CLIENT: (sigh) Well then I feel like (pause) I think that is something that should be explored. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20206-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20206-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">THERAPIST: I am not talking about that.

So let me remind myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027B\">CLIENT: I would have to order it so it is not convenient. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027D\">THERAPIST: I will bring it to you but if you could bring it back the next week so I can use it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027F\">CLIENT: Oh sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20281\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) So what do you think about all this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20283\">CLIENT: Well I think that it is empowering. You know, it is empowering. You know, I think there is a certain freedom in being told by somebody that it is okay to think. To just to have the thoughts. And it is like, yeah, cognitively we know those kind of things. And we probably even tell other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202831\">those things when it is like, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20285\">And I think that trying to devise some kind of a little practice for myself whereby I can just sit with that. Can I just sit with the thought and allow it to be? And not, A, feel like schmuck for having the thought or, you know, try to suppress it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20287\">THERAPIST: I think you can accept the fact that you are a human being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20289\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028B\">THERAPIST: And human beings, to a greater or lesser extent depending on who you are, have socially unacceptable thoughts. Sometimes altruistic feelings, sexual feelings, physical needs, emotional needs. I mean and that just makes you a human being like the rest of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028D\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028F\">THERAPIST: And that is not only perfectly okay to be but whatever has happened to you in your life. Right? And all the history we have been through about you are sort of getting the messages about what you are not allowed to be, you still are amazingly you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20291\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20293\">THERAPIST: I mean you still are a deeply feeling, thinking man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20295\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20297\">THERAPIST: And that is why you still hurt over the fact that your relationship with you wife is not what it could be or what you would want it to be. And as painful as that is, that means that a healthy part of you is not destroyed. You are not apathetic to it. Right? And I hope that you are never apathetic <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202971\">to it. I mean, I hope you don\u2019t continue to be in pain around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20296-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20296-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20299\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029B\">THERAPIST: I hope that that gets resolved one day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029F\">THERAPIST: But if that part of you You know, because if you think about it, you know, that has got to be one of the best parts of you, the part of you that wants to connect on a genuine level with other human beings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A3\">THERAPIST: And that has not been damaged.

But what do you have to lose? It is probably not going to make things worse? You know, right now it is sort of status quo. But it still eats at you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B5\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B7\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t talk about it all the time but it eats at you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B9\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BB\">THERAPIST: because you want more. And after being married to someone for a long and you haven\u2019t given up that either it could be more or that there is something else out there for you, whatever that is. Right? And maybe you don\u2019t want more from your marriage. Maybe you grieve the fact that it wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202BB1\">what you wanted it to be. But you will never know until you find out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BD\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Mm hm. (pause) Yeah, yeah. (pause) Well, I think that it empowers me a little bit more to at least stand there and feel like I am, you know, okay with facing this. And, yeah, I think I feel less committed to ignore and to run away. And it is like, well, even though I may not know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202BD1\">that means right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BF\">THERAPIST: Sure. Running away does not diminish your pain in this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C1\">CLIENT: No. It hasn\u2019t worked for me for decades.

I think I need to spend some time just sitting with the thought of (pause) You know, it seems obvious to me that the first place is, you know, \u201cOkay, we need to have at talk.\u201d But I get to that place and then I am not sure I even want to have the damn talk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C7\">THERAPIST: Right. And that is honest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C9\">CLIENT: (laughs) So then I am like, \u201cOkay. Well tomorrow.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CB\">THERAPIST: But it is okay to be conflicted. I don\u2019t really think you have to know. And I don\u2019t even know if you can. You can think, well, maybe you just have a talk and you say, \u201cI really am not happy and we have to talk. But I don\u2019t really know what to say because it has been so long since we have <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202CB1\">done this.\u201d You don\u2019t have to have the right words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CF\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t even have to have the talk.

Part of you wants to leave it the hell alone so you don\u2019t stir up the bees nest. Part of you may want to go in there and see what is really in there. And part of you probably really <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202D31\">doesn\u2019t even want to know because maybe you don\u2019t want to put forth the effort. And all of that is okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N202D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And I tell any couple that I work with, \u201cI really don\u2019t need a hundred percent commitment. I need about 30 percent. Twenty Five definitely. I need a good 25 percent. And I don\u2019t even need that every time we meet. But I need about 25 percent because who is a hundred percent committed <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202D71\">all the time? Newlyweds maybe. So they say. Right? But that is just honest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D9\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Mm hm. Mm hm. Yeah. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DB\">THERAPIST: How are you doing? That is a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is a lot. But I don\u2019t feel overwhelmed by that. It is kind of like, well, of course. You know? This is just one of those kind of roads that I think all you can do is just kind of keep walking toward, marching toward it. Yeah, running away, I know what that path looks like. So this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202DD1\">going to seem unfamiliar and, you know, I am going to feel a little tentative about this and it is okay to be in that place too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DF\">THERAPIST: Remember, one of the best parts of you wants to connect on a genuine level with people.

So that is not You know, no matter what happens whatever you decide to do. And if you do decide to have a discussion, however it goes, that is a really good healthy part. There is nothing wrong with that whatsoever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E5\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E7\">THERAPIST: You may not get it back or maybe you will.

Yeah. That is true enough. Then, you know, the next part of that is the actual practicalities of making that happen. It is like I think we both can become pretty adept at like Well, I will take some of blame in that. But the schedule is set up in such a way -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EF\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F1\">CLIENT: that there is just no time to schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F3\">THERAPIST: Well, because it makes it easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F5\">CLIENT: It makes it a lot easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F7\">THERAPIST: That can be changed too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F9\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202FB\">THERAPIST: But it makes it easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202FD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20343\">THERAPIST: They are not unrealistic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20345\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah. If I really felt like they could go away or I could turn them off. You know? But I haven\u2019t found that to be true. (laughs) I haven\u2019t found that switch.

It is like I can\u2019t not see the world any other way than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2034F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I am honestly trying to think of the relationships, romantic relationships in my life or friendships that have been in my life. I have looked for similar things. I want to be understood. You know? I want to be validated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20351\">CLIENT: Yeah:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20353\">THERAPIST: I want to be needed depending on the type of the relationship it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20355\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20357\">THERAPIST: I want to give back to my relationships. The needs look a little different depending on who the other person is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20359\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035B\">THERAPIST: But the needs are very similar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035D\">CLIENT: Sure. (pause) Yeah, yeah. (pause) Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035F\">THERAPIST: I also wonder too if there is anything in there about if divorce is on the table are you a bad guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20361\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.

I mean that is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20367\">THERAPIST: So that means by staying you are a good guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20366-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20366-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20369\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2036B\">THERAPIST: Okay. You are martyring yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2036D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sure. You know, for my wife and for my folks. Yeah. My kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2036F\">THERAPIST: But they don\u2019t live your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20371\">CLIENT: Hm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20373\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t live your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20375\">CLIENT: No. No. No. Yeah, but that is a pretty big mountain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20377\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20379\">CLIENT: You know, walking down the path, you know, it is like, \u201cWhoa. Wait a minute.\u201d I had this vision of the path which was kind of like looking into the deep dark woods. And now all of a sudden I recognize just as I get started down the path, \u201cWoo!\u201d There is a huge mountain in the way. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2037B\">THERAPIST: You know, years ago I worked with this client who I liked very much. He was in his early fifties and he had been married for a long time. And he and his wife had divorced. She had some substance abuse issues and he finally forced divorced. And he never saw himself as divorced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2037D\">And I remember him sitting in front of me and I said, \u201cYou know, what brings you in?\u201d And he dissolved into sobs. And I thought, \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d And then I tried to process what happened and nothing. He just cleaned up like nothing ever happened. And I thought, \u201cOkay. Maybe I didn\u2019t see that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2037F\">Then we started talking again and the same thing happened. And it turned out he had all these unresolved grief issues years, years that the very act of kind of finally sitting in front of someone and talking about it brought it up. So first we started off with his marriage which he was very upset that <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2037F1\">it didn\u2019t work out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20381\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20383\">THERAPIST: Okay. And he had sort of martyred himself a bit. And then we went into some of his issues with his parents and, you know, some of that didn\u2019t work out the way that he wanted it to. And he was always the good guy. You know? And he always did the right thing but in a lot of ways he was miserable <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203831\">and pissed about it. I don\u2019t know if he always recognized that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20385\">You know and he was starting dating again and that kind of brought up some issues. But all these messages that he had heard about himself, you know, weren\u2019t necessarily true. They were kind of the things that he was told because of other people\u2019s stuff. Right? And he was really this incredible person <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203851\">and he just had to finally sort of let this go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20387\">And he had been divorced for several years. You know? But it was a real struggle because he never saw himself because it involved this [identity issue.] (ph) He didn\u2019t want to be divorced. Right? But it just got so bad, the substance issues got so bad. And, you know, I think you guys are not similar <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203871\">in many ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20389\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2038B\">THERAPIST: But there are some similarities there. And I guess I am saying that to say, you know, looking at this stuff, I mean it is painful, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily Avoiding it doesn\u2019t provide any clarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2038D\">CLIENT: No. And, you know, and I think also recognize it. Not that I necessarily subscribe to the medical model of addiction and all those words and everything. But it is like, yeah, I can see how my behavior provides some codependency for somebody who is also trying to avoid. And it is like, well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2038D1\">yeah, if somebody stopped the merry-go-round maybe it would facilitate change all the way around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2038F\">THERAPIST: And there are some real good reasons. And I mean I guess I want to acknowledge. There are some real reasons that you have avoided having this conversation. Things have taught you over time that this conversation isn\u2019t welcome all the time, is scary. And I think that is true. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N2038E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2038E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20391\">But I also think that not having the conversation or sort of denying yourself the chance for understanding. You know, you are going to find clients who don\u2019t really care about insight. Right? And that is okay. You work them with CBT, you work with them with some of the other models. Because they are <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203911\">not interested in knowing the why, they want to know what. Behavior is what. You kind of want to know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20393\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20395\">THERAPIST: Because everything about you, all the philosophies you seek are about the \u201cwhy.\u201d And so this is the one area that your \u201cwhy\u201d is missing. And it is not that she can fill in the pieces but the possible collaboration and maybe you can fill it in yourself. But you can\u2019t do that if you are stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20397\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) Mm hm. (sigh) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20399\">THERAPIST: How are you doing right now? That is a lot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2039B\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, you know, it\u2019s (pause) Yeah. Just knowing that, yeah, this is like it is the 800 pound gorilla. You know? It is what I have got to do. It is the work that I have got to do. And we can talk about other peripheral things that may be related but it is like, yeah, you know what? I <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2039B1\">have just got to climb this damn mountain. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2039D\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t have to start at the top though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2039F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203A1\">THERAPIST: You can start with kind of letting yourself think whatever you need to think and looking at it. It can start with, \u201cWhat would you say if you wanted to say something. It doesn\u2019t have to start with a conversation. It can start with, what would it be like to have a conversation? You don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203A11\">to have that conversation. You don\u2019t ever have to have that conversation but you certainly don\u2019t have to have it any time soon. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203A3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203A5\">THERAPIST: But thinking about having it or thinking about, if you could say anything what you would want to say and what you want to hear? You know? Entertaining in your own mind what you would like it to be. You know? Or what you are afraid might happen might be a good place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203A7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203A9\">THERAPIST: A little mental rehearsal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But I think just, you know, recognizing that it is just important to stay with. (pause) Yeah. And just being with the snake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203AD\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203AF\">CLIENT: Being with the cobra. Whatever. It is just like I have got to be with this. You know, as opposed to running off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203B1\">THERAPIST: Well I hate homework but I am going to give you homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203B3\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203B5\">THERAPIST: I would like for you to let your mind roam. Right? You know? If you should think back to our conversation today or think about what it would be like to talk with your wife. All of the positive, negative and every thought in between without censoring yourself. And if you do catch yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203B51\">censoring you I would like to hear about it. What are the areas that you most censor yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203B7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203B9\">THERAPIST: You know, and what feelings come up? Is it because you are about to have a thought that you deemed shameful? So I just would like for you to be aware of the kind of meta cognition piece of what your thoughts are and how often during the day you tell yourself not to have particular thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N203B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561984\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203BB\">CLIENT: Mm hm.

And I have, actually I picked up a dedicated notebook to start journaling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C3\">CLIENT: I used to do that kind of thing anyway. So it is like, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C5\">THERAPIST: Okay. Let me know how that works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I will see. You know, I am really trying and I feel like it has not been Interestingly enough it has not been something that has worked well for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It may not be your thing. Maybe instead you go out to your, you know, is it like a workshop? And do something with your hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203CB\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 56:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203CD\">THERAPIST: But journaling, you know, you can see if that works.
