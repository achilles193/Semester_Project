(pause) I suppose I should start with last (sighs) week. Sometime... not this past week, but the week before that I... had posted on Facebook something to the effect of... you know, \u201cI apologize if this is ill suited for a Facebook post, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">but... Man (ph), this country is suffering from a mental health crisis. I thought the Newtown tragedy would actually spur some sort of action or conversation about the... fact that mental health, mental illness is widespread and (inaudible), that the stigma around it which need not be there... (sighs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">Powerless as I feel to do anything about this, what I can do is this: I take these drugs every day, I do weekly therapy, and... you know... mental health is not, or mental illness is not... anything to be ashamed of and I think if you are suffering, you should get some help.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">I got a huge response to it. I mean, I have been actually thinking about doing it since the actual Newtown tragedy, you know, because... little has happened in the aftermath of that event. You know, we\u2019ve had... probably hundreds of other tragedies on a smaller scale since then. Anyway, so a huge response, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">you know. And (sighs)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: From people you know, from public, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Well... I shared it with friends. A couple of people asked if they could share it, if they could make it public so that they could share it with their friends; so I did. And... yeah. So this was, it was mainly my friends who were (chuckles) friends, Facebook friends. (chuckles) But I got an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">e-mail from my dad the... next day, or two days later, saying, you know, \u201cI... your Facebook post was sent to me,\u201d because he\u2019s not on Facebook. You know, basically saying, \u201cI support you and whatever you need to do to be healthy.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So I called him this past Monday. You know, I said, \u201cThis is what\u2019s, you know, this is kind of what\u2019s been going on with me.\u201d So I had to really tread lightly, because I didn\u2019t want to get into this (therapist affirms) on the phone. But (sighs) you know, because I didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cWell, look, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">know, we can trace this back to (chuckles) something specific and...,\u201d so on and so forth. But... And so I hadn\u2019t... I had done a little bit of work earlier in the week, and then yesterday I did some more. (pause) I also sent it to my sister. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: The letter or your post? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: The letter; sorry. And... (sighs) She could only read like, the first page. She was concerned that my dad would be hit pretty hard with it. This was like, yesterday and she hadn\u2019t had a chance to read the whole thing. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to read the whole thing in order to tell me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">if you think that that\u2019s still the case.\u201d So I haven\u2019t heard back from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">But, what I\u2019d like to do is I\u2019d like to read this, because this is pretty close to the final version, if not the final version. But I want to read it and hear it. I\u2019m not reading it to (flipping pages)... run it by you for (chuckles) content or even, you know, what I should do or shouldn\u2019t do, but more <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">as a... sounding board, because, just... to hear my thoughts after I read it, I guess. (therapist affirms) So... I\u2019ve just increased the font. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s... a novelette. So, I\u2019ll just get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561871\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019ll listen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Is that ready? All right. Okay. Dear Dad; I don\u2019t enjoy writing this letter to you, but if I\u2019m going to succeed in getting through my personal developmental issues, it must be done. I am in a constant state of anxiety. My stomach is perpetually clenched, my breathing abbreviated, my chest hangs <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">with weight. I\u2019m on medication for anxiety, but it can only do so much, and that is not enough. I\u2019ve been carrying a sense of constant dread for far too long, with no idea as to how to release it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">This letter has been in draft form for the past four years. During that time, you\u2019ve probably sensed that our relationship has not been as warm as it once was. You can well understand that actually finishing and sending it off did not hold a lot of incentive for me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">did not know how to communicate this to you in such a way that could both peel the burden from me and also help shape the way you would react to it. But I have reached the conclusion that your reaction is not something that I can control. What I can control, however, is constructing and delivering this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">message, as painful as it may be, with the trust that we can have a more meaningful relationship if I\u2019m able to tell you what has been going on with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">I have been working with therapists for several years now. My current doctor has helped me understand the source of that angst... (pause) (aside: Sorry.) The... \/corrects\/ understand that the source of that angst is a manifestation of guilt and shame. Guilt is the feeling you have when you\u2019ve done something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">you regret, but which no one knows about. (flipping pages) Shame is the feeling when you\u2019ve done something you regret (sighs) and others do know about it. My situation, I was sidled with both guilt and shame for various reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">The combination of these two has resulted in my inability to forgive myself for things which were not my fault, but also things for which I am to blame. I now hope that I\u2019m able to relinquish some of the anger and hurt that I have toward you, and move through a process of living forgiveness. I can also... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">I can also let go of commensurate guilt and shame which I carry, and forgive myself. If I cannot shed these, I despair... for living with these feelings... If I cannot shed these, I despair. For living with these feelings has been disheartening, and suffering with these while on medications designed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">to alleviate these feelings has been demoralizing, but I will hope for the best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">As you may be aware, I was diagnosed with clinical depression about eleven years ago. What I found alarming was that my psychologists estimated that I had a low-level depression for many years. I knew I had low self-esteem; I\u2019ve had it for as long as I can remember. But part of the problem is that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">don\u2019t remember much of my adolescence before the age of 13. Over the past ten years I\u2019ve been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. Whenever I would ask some of the siblings if they experience depression, most said it was likely I was just not getting enough exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">What they were not aware of was that I underwent significant trauma in my junior high years that has scarred me ever since, that they did not have to endure or even know about. (flipping pages) To be blunt, the trauma is the series of events which encompassed my own inappropriate interactions with Brandy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">the revelation of your relationship with her, your losing your job, and the fallout from all of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561871\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">One very vivid memory of this shame and guilt was while I was working at Maggie\u2019s (aside: that\u2019s a pizza place). When I was 15, the summer before high school, I was finishing a shift on a Saturday afternoon. There was a customer finishing his meal, who exchanged some pleasantries with me while I brought <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">in the remaining tubs full of dishes. When I clocked out, as was usual, I made a burger and fries and went out to sit in one of the booths. The customer, still nursing his soda, invited me to sit with him. Although I didn\u2019t really want to, I accepted his offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">We started talking about Haverford. He was quite a few years older than me, but had lived in the area all of his life. We somehow got on the topic of Haverford High School, that he was in the program. As always, I said with pride, \u201cMy dad started that program.\u201d (aside: this program was like a inter... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">a program in the high schools for troubled youths, drug addiction, family problems) As always, I said with pride, \u201cMy dad started that program.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d he asked. He then proceeded to quiz me on a story he had heard, something about you ordering up a Chinese girl for some action on the side. All I could say was, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d but inside, I was shattering. The pride I had just reflected was now burning a pit in my gut. If <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">this guy knows, who else knows? I couldn\u2019t finish my lunch. I couldn\u2019t even speak. I walked home, devastated. Suddenly every conversation I had, every encounter, I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201cDo they know? Does he know? Does she know? Who has she told?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">When I got to high school, the first day of each term was always a nail biter. Calling roll, the teacher would call my name, ask me if I was Harry Clovis\u2019s (ph) son. I would hold my breath and say, \u201cYes,\u201d wondering what they or anyone else in the room, was going to say at that moment. But the teacher <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">would always say, \u201cGreat guy! Say hello to him for me!\u201d But these encounters were always anxiety inducing. Any conversations which might turn to something recalling our family adopting two children, what my dad does for a living, or anything which might reveal my shame were quickly directed as far away <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">as possible. I was always on guard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">When I say I have depression, low self-esteem, anxiety, I feel I need to be a bit more illustrative. You may identify with some of these, but I can only speak for myself. For decades, I would wake up feeling, knowing really, that I was worthless, that I had no redeeming qualities, that I was destined <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">for pipedreams without the courage, trust, and confidence to pursue them. If someone told me I was good at something, I was quick to minimize his complement as either incorrect or misguided. If someone were (sic) nice to me, I assumed she was just... I assumed she just wanted something from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">Any success I achieved was a fluke. Finishing my BA, winning an award, getting accepted to Amherst, UPenn, Stanford, completing my Master\u2019s with an Aaverage, winning a fellowship to go to the abroad; all of these were flukes. Every one of them could be explained as anything but the result of my work <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">ethic, my talents, or my perseverance, for I do not possess these qualities. Anyone who really knows me like I know me would certainly have never given me any of those accolades. Everything I have done is overshadowed, blinded, by what I did when I was 12. The shame is strong, the guilt is paralyzing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561871\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">Drinking has been a short-term fix, a way to feel a little better about myself, but it has always been destructive. The instant gratification of a buzz has always been the low-hanging fruit, the quick and cheap way for me to carry on with the baggage I was lugging. Delayed gratification has been elusive, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">due to this self-destructive behavior. Self-destructive behavior, however, is a bit of a misnomer. I cannot destroy what is already shattered. Self-destructive behavior for me should be called self-affirming behavior, because it reinforces how bad I am. It underlines it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">What normally would be called self-affirming behavior, or actions that would be considered healthy, constructive, and enriching are pointless, because they refuse to mesh with who I really am. In other words, I am a horrible person. Exercising would be good for me. How can something be good for me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">when I am an irredeemably horrible person? Writing songs would be uplifting. To be uplifted would be to deny my worthlessness. Writing songs is a waste of time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">Unfortunately, this way of thinking is very powerful. Even if I were able to get on a series of positive actions, I\u2019m always quick to remind myself that I never finish anything, so don\u2019t expect this streak to last. Albeit harmful, betting against myself as been another form of self-affirming behavior. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">Even writing\/finishing this letter has been a bit of a coin toss. But quitting drinking hasn\u2019t solved all of my problems. I still cling to the instant gratification as a way, the only consistent way, for me to be able to feel good about myself. Can I get beyond this, by addressing the issue head-on, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">that I am not what I did when I was 12 years old? What does this say about how I view you? Can you be the father you are, without being the person that I\u2019ve held responsible for my troubles? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">As you know, I flew in from Mexico in May of 2010 to undergo some intensive Family of Origin Therapy. This therapy is designed to dig into the problems that occur in the person\u2019s formative years. Although some of the information I felt was hard to understand or relate to my situation, I did come away <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">with some pretty intense resentment toward you and mom, both in handling my upbringing, and in dealing with the Brandy crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">In many ways, I feel as though I was an accident, not a miracle, as Mom would suggest. I think you and Mom trusted the older children to help raise me. By the time I got older, it was as if you had grown tired of parenting. Liam said that when he was growing up, he had fond memories of you coming home <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">with a box of fireworks for the family to enjoy. I was stunned to hear this. I have no such memories. The memories I do have are not very flattering, and come down to an obsessive concern about how everything reflected on you, and scolding was the way to parent. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561871\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">When I was in fourth grade and playing my first year of little league baseball, I remember how you came to one of my games. You did not come down to the field, but instead, leaned against the car up at the corner near the dentist office. During the game, I hit the ball into the outfield, but apparently <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">got thrown out. I also apparently walked to my position in right field when our team took the field at the end of the inning. (flipping pages) Didn\u2019t run; walked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">When the game was over, I ran up to you to share my excitement of hitting the ball. You scolded me for not running out to the outfield when we were to take the field. You threatened me by saying something to the effect of, \u201cIf I see you doing that again...\u201d What kind of a man scolds his nine-year-old <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200431\">son for that? It would have been one thing if the coaches had requested it, or that you had previously requested it. But this was the first I\u2019d heard of it. When I got home and ran inside to tell Mom, I said, \u201cMom, I got a hit!\u201d But you couldn\u2019t help yourself but correct, by saying, \u201cDude, you did not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200432\">get a hit. You hit the ball.\u201d How demoralizing! I was nine years old! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">When I said that I think you became obsessed with how things reflected on you, this is an example. The former varsity head baseball coach\u2019s son doesn\u2019t run out to the field! Shame! It\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t think of how your actions in the coming years would reflect on the family. But in fact, it cast <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">a long shadow. I can\u2019t speak for William (aside: he\u2019s my youngest brother), but I know intimately, painfully just how damaging those actions were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">I think you tend to wash your hands of my relationship with Brandy, as if I were a grown adult who knew what he was doing. But no, I was eleven or twelve. Brandy was older than me, and this household was under your watch. I\u2019ll not criticize you for what you did with her. That is not the issue. The issue <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">is that for twenty years, I carried with me the guilt of feeling as though I was an incestuous molester, who was afraid to have children because of what I might do to them. No one\u2014not the state, not your counsellors, not the court, and certainly neither you nor Mom thought it might be prudent for me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200472\">to get some help. This is the issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">You were so concerned with getting through your affair (flipping pages) that you neglected the health of my development at a crucial time in my life. This was a serious dereliction of parenting that has affected every chance for success that I could have had. Sure, you might say then, \u201cWell, gee, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">seem to be pretty successful, given all that has happened. Couldn\u2019t have been too bad, right?\u201d My successes came through hard work, by suspending my belief in who I really was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">Maybe you didn\u2019t know this, but I began smoking pot at 14, drinking alcohol before that. I had a serious shoplifting problem, hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars. I stole from the people for whom I babysat. I graduated in the bottom 25% of my class in Haverford. (clears throat) Because I showed up <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">hung over to take the test, I obviously didn\u2019t score too well on the SAT. When I took the ACT, while working, I entered into general college the place for \u201clow achievers.\u201d I worked my ass off to get on the Dean\u2019s List to transfer into the college of Liberal Arts. This was the beginning of a lot of work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">but I was doing all of this while struggling with depression and not believing that I would amount to anything. Imagine where I might be if I had gotten the help I so needed? (clears throat) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561871\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">As I said, I cannot forgive myself until I forgive you. In an attempt to understand what I am dealing with, I have also had the chance to reflect on your situation, of why you behaved as you did. As it turns out, over the past few years, thinking about all I wanted to say in this letter has actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D1\">allowed me to rethink my anger and hurt in a more compassionate light. I have been able to view your behavior and actions as reflected against and in my own. This has given me insight into why you may have done nothing as you did, why you responded the way you did, and why I reacted the way I have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D2\">various challenges in my own life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">As I think about my inability to forgive myself, I wonder how you are able to forgive yourself? Not that you shouldn\u2019t, but knowing the difficulty I\u2019ve had, I suspect you may have had some difficulty yourself. This, for me, is largely a result of wanting to keep quiet about the whole mess, as it is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F1\">not a very comfortable subject. But for you, I gather, without any person who wants to talk about it, you probably haven\u2019t been able to deal with the topic since completing the court-ordered therapy. How, then, could I expect you to be able to recognize and acknowledge my damage, if you haven\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F2\">been able to acknowledge your own? But I suspect your own upbringing contained a mechanism for dealing with what was uncomfortable, mainly by burying it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">That said, I don\u2019t wish to play the victim. I am making a concrete choice to move forward as the person I am, warts and all. But who is that person who has suffered, and how is his suffering unique? Who can say they have lived unscathed by the tragedies that are all around us? How can I relate to someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">who has fallen if I have never fallen? Am I stronger as a result of this history? My depression masks the strength, because it pervades any thoughts I might have about perseverance and any ideas that I could be strong and effective, that I could live a life of my choosing. (flipping pages)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">But I hasten to add that I am removing that mask, which for so long I had no idea I was wearing. Now instead of a victim, I want to be a healthy human being who can empathize with others who are suffering, not as a fellow sufferer who can commiserate, but as a support, because I have healed. I write <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">this letter selfishly, for my own benefit, because I hate living with the fear, guilt, and shame which has governed my entire adult life. I didn\u2019t want the message to sting, but I can see how it might, and that possibility provides me with no satisfaction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">I love you, and I want you to know that I forgive you for what you did or didn\u2019t. I do not conflate the person you are with the things you have done. Now I just need to tell myself the very same thing and mean it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">P.S. If you would like to respond, please do so by mail.

(clears throat)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a powerful letter. How does it feel to hear the whole thing, to read it through?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s surprisingly comprehensive. (clears throat) I think, you know, the issue I had for a long time was, \u201cDid I get everything in? Did I include everything that I have ever thought about in the past, you know, four years,\u201d for example. And... (pause) Yeah, I mean (clears throat), I know for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D1\">a long time, there were sections that have just seemed like, \u201cIs this necessary, is this necessary, does this really say what I want it to say?\u201d I think that\u2019s all the work I did yesterday, just kind of trying to organize my thought process and get to the, from the top to the end, really. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">(pause) But... I do feel like, although it\u2019s a powerful letter and, in some ways... condemning, I think it also... is balanced by a certain amount of empathy and... compassion... (pause) which is... I mean, those contributions were made in the past six months or year. They\u2019re not, you know, they don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F1\">form the basis of the letter itself. I feel like, with those additions, it\u2019s a... it\u2019s more balanced, more... digestible, I guess. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does encompass a lot of what we\u2019ve talked about and different things, ideas and things that you\u2019ve expressed in here as being really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah (sighs), yeah. (pause) I mean there are things that I know I\u2019ve left out, but that was more of a choice. I think, just things that I can bring up down the road, if need be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">THERAPIST: I mean, it doesn\u2019t need to contain everything you\u2019ve ever thought about in order to be complete. (client affirms) What makes it complete is that it hits upon the major themes. You know, I think the theme of your feelings about yourself, how you have felt about him in the transition of being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200651\">able to find compassion along with anger. I really think you really have expressed those themes to him, and done it in a way that, you know... You do the best you can to really say what you mean to say. I think, you know like you said, you can\u2019t control what his reaction is, but clearly, you\u2019ve done <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200652\">a lot of work in trying to be careful about what you\u2019re expressing and trying to be complete about what you\u2019re expressing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">CLIENT: Good. Because that is (clears throat) was a concern I had. (pause) But this is meant to be something to move forward, not stay where we are, the skin and bones stranger, semi a stranger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">THERAPIST: Do you feel ready?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">CLIENT: I do. I do. (pause) I just want to hear what my sister has to say, and then... because she knows all of this, more or less. She said to me last night... You know, she\u2019s very supportive and she and I are the closest in age. Let me very clear, this is not the sister who was... (chuckles) okay? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B1\">She said, \u201cI know you need to present this to Dad. I know you need to do this, but I\u2019m just concerned that he\u2019s going to take it very hard.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">(pause) I think what she... was expecting was that I was just going to send it to him and that was it. End of the story. I don\u2019t know why she thought that, but, you know, she was saying, you know, \u201cHow can this, how can you move forward in this if it\u2019s just going to be like, close that case and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">move on?\u201d So, I think those concerns of hers were...

And I think in the first letter (corrects), first paragraph... \u201cwith the trust that we could have a more meaningful relationship if I\u2019m able to tell you what\u2019s been going on with me.\u201d That I think, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">THERAPIST: There was a lot of space between the first paragraph and the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, you know... (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: You want to make sure he doesn\u2019t forget that part (chuckles), because there is a lot, you know, having never spoken to your father, it\u2019s hard for me to make an assumption about how he\u2019ll respond. But I can imagine that it would feel hurtful, as well as being kind of heart-breaking to hear <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200771\">that your child is feeling this way (client affirms), kind of both feeling badly for himself and for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess that\u2019s one of the things that I thought about earlier, was that (sighs) whether I need to communicate in there that I know he wouldn\u2019t want me to continue suffering like this, but... it\u2019s so long already! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no I\u2019m certainly not suggesting that you add pieces, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: No, no, yeah. (sighs) (pause) Yeah, well, maybe I can look in there and see if I could drop some hints that (chuckles)... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t feel like necessarily you need to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: I mean, you end it by saying \u201cI love you.\u201d That\u2019s, you know, a pretty... relationship-building (client affirms) expression.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: I mean, was that clear, though, as far as why I wanted it in writing? I mean... All I\u2019m trying to avoid is a knee-jerk (therapist affirms) tear-ridden phone call that\u2019s like, you know, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Well, why are you sorry? I don\u2019t want it to get emotional over the phone, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">I want some thoughtful reflection, not a response. (pause) Yeah. Because he\u2019s, that\u2019s... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You know, so I mean, I think the only way to make that cl , you could take out a line of like, \u201cif you\u2019re going to respond, do it in a written letter,\u201d and just keep it to the like, \u201cI\u2019d like, you know, when you respond,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d like your response to be...\u201d You know, focus on what you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">want. I mean, it\u2019s not that you really want a like, a written letter versus an e-mail. It\u2019s that you want a thoughtful, processed response rather than a quick response. (pause) And that might, that might help him to understand what it is you\u2019re really asking for. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re asking him for <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B2\">a hard copy, you\u2019re asking for a thoughtful copy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I just don\u2019t want to get a phone call, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: So you, so that, you know, I\u2019m saying, it would be easier for me to talk about this type of thing, you know, via letter or... or if, you know, saying you know, a phone conversation would be really hard for me.

(therapist chuckles) Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C91\">is better, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s probably more of a long-lasting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s right. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And you could be a good person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (clears throat) (pause) I am a good person. (pause) It\u2019s just sometimes I fall down, and I can\u2019t get (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D3\">THERAPIST: (affirms) And all people do. (pause) It doesn\u2019t seem fair to define yourself by your worst moments or your mistakes only.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, especially if they... (chuckles) are... one for every thousand good things. (pause) So how long did it take me to read that letter? A long time! Jeepers! (pause) So, you know, I\u2019m not going to see you for two weeks. (pause) So this feels like a good... time to send this off. I can fill <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D51\">you in on all the details (therapist chuckles) when I get back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I think it sounds like a good time, because you feel ready. (client affirms) You\u2019ve been kind of gearing yourself up for it and setting yourself milestones. (client affirms) And, you know, it feels complete. So I mean, you\u2019ve held onto it, because you were worried that there were important <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D71\">pieces that might not get incorporated, or things that you were having trouble getting across. As you read it today, you know when I asked you how you felt after reading it, you said, \u201cIt felt complete.\u201d I think that\u2019s... If it\u2019s done, there is no need for you to hang onto it. (client affirms) It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D72\">time for you to let it go, and let yourself... experience whatever it is that comes with sending it off, whether that be nothing, or something that you don\u2019t know how to expect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (clears throat) (pause) You know... I don\u2019t know if there is some, I don\u2019t think there is any real correlation here, but... four years ago... this coming week, I was in Guatemala, Antigua for Holy Week. I think (inaudible\/weak) just... magnificent processions, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D91\">of them, you\u2019ve seen them, but they... The people in the towns, they create these rugs of palm branches (ph), artwork made out of grass and flowers and fruit, marbles or eggs or whatever, whatever, sand... They are just incredible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB\">They lay them on the street, you know, they lay it out, and then that night, when the procession comes through... you know, a hundred or so men, or a hundred or so women start toting (ph), carrying these gigantic floats that can weigh up to 10,000 pounds. They come through, and they just walk over these <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB1\">things, so that the art is... is... fleeting. And I was there (clears throat) and weeks later is when, weeks before was when (clears throat) that I, you know, the Mexico incident, which is a few weeks after is when I went home for that Family of Origin Therapy. Next week, I\u2019ll be in Arizona for Holy <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB2\">Week and... it almost seems like some sort of... internal resurrection... perhaps. Perhaps not. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561871\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Let it be! (client affirms) I mean, I think, you know, part of it, like you said, is a choice. You can choose to let this be a marker of a new era for you, a new phase of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (inaudible\/weak)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And that, you know, that doesn\u2019t mean that everything is going to feel awesome all of the time, but you can, you know, when you have a hard day, or you forget to let go of this, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s meant nothing and it\u2019s, you know, a failure, and that the expectation is unrealistic. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200E11\">It just means that, you know, letting it be, that hard days, hard times are still part of the new experience of having let this go, and letting yourself feel proud of the fact that you set out to do this piece of work, and you did it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. It might be the hardest piece of work I\u2019ve done... ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I don\u2019t doubt that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E7\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. That\u2019s... That\u2019s only occurred to me now. It\u2019s interesting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a pretty meaningful expedition you set yourself on when you started writing the letter, and continued to pursue, even though it was really hard and felt daunting and you wondered whether it would ever feel done. (client affirms) But you kept doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s funny, because most of the work was done in my head, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200ED\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t make it, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not work! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EF\">CLIENT: No, I know. It\u2019s work, it certainly is, and I look forward to not having to... tally these things, you know. Oh, make sure I... make sure you... oh, there are that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting that you brought up the fleeting art. (client affirms) Just because you can\u2019t see it, just because it was done in your head, doesn\u2019t mean that it wasn\u2019t there (client affirms) and that it didn\u2019t exist. It doesn\u2019t have to have a permanent record to be real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. You know, I did three... audio-visual slide shows of those events.

This happens all over the... Latin world, mostly, yeah. Apparently, they\u2019re just incredible. (pause) Here and gone. This happens over the course of like, four or five days, it\u2019s just... anyway. So, that\u2019s me. That\u2019s where I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Well, thank you for sharing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FB\">CLIENT: Thanks for listening.
