One of them was like just starting out as a litigator and is really excited about it and really loves it and was like you know, sort of geeking out about being a lawyer which I found hilarious and the other one is, she just finished her dissertation and is starting her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200513\">internship in clinical psychology and so like she was talking about \u2013 she like works with \u2013 she\u2019s working with kids and they both seem really happy and were easy to talk to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559815\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(Pause): [00:09:10 00:09:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s sort of like I set up these go and be social things and dreaded them severely and they all turned out to be pretty good.

Eliot\u2019s \u201cFour Quartets\u201d which I had a high school teacher, which was a teacher actually at the boy\u2019s school that was affiliated with us. I had him only as a senior and he was like one of the best teachers I ever had except for the fact that the older I get the more I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">no \u2013 that\u2019s really not okay. You should figure out a way around this. He was just like really late. He would take like three months to grade papers, at least. Just nothing was never on time, nothing. Like he never got anything back to you. So at like my high school graduation he said, \u201ccongratulations, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D2\">you\u2019re a wonderful student and I don\u2019t usually do this but I have a gift for you, but I left it at home.\u201d And was like, \u2018I\u2019ll send it to you,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018okay.\u2019 Five years later (laughs) at St. Margaret\u2019 graduation like I\u2019d been teaching there a year and am leaving he was like here you go and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D3\">gave me the \u201cFour Quartets\u201d and Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cThe Waves,\u201d which are two of the most opaque works of literature I can conceive of. I actually didn\u2019t finish \u201cThe Waves.\u201d I didn\u2019t like Virginia Woolf that much. But I really like these.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know (unclear). I know like, \u201cThe Wasteland\u201d and all that stuff. It\u2019s sort of like it\u2019 later than \u201cThe Wasteland,\u201d like one of his last big works. He talks about a lot of the same things as \u201cThe Wasteland.\u201d As far as I can tell he has a lot of religious stuff and a lot of metaphysical <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">stuff at that time a lot. And sort of deliberately not looking at scholarship or tried to trying to crack it. Just reading it. It\u2019s very beautiful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559815\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(Pause): [00:17:14 00:18:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, a couple of passages in there I\u2019ve seen or heard at a church service set to music for religious context like you know, he\u2019s definitely talking about religion.

I\u2019m thinking of the spoiled milk which you curiously own but micro-flexively put back. You know? I find something very poignant about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Oh. Do other people not do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Not that. Like the trope of spoiled milk in particular, you know? Like you having to hold onto things that are supposed to be like not (unclear) good, but (unclear). You know, are kind of gross and awful. And pretending you\u2019re glad, which you are, of course, to be in a (unclear) position <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">in which you\u2019re staying at home and not having anything but spoiled milk. But as a way in which that situation seemed more resonant than the one of having been unable to go out. Like, in reality this morning you could go out which is great. But it sounds like the more familiar \u2013 it either felt more <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200872\">familiar would be the one where you had to stay home and not have to go out. And then there\u2019s the (unclear) kind of absurdly out of step getting back to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah, it is a little ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And on top of that, it gives you the stuff that is incredibly opaque and difficult. I\u2019m sure that like in the sense of it it\u2019s all okay, but it\u2019s all off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think he gave them to me because I just loved the opaque and difficult stuff.

I feel like that is sort of sniping at people in church music who \u2013 I mean my experience with people in church music is that none of them are as smart as they think they are and they\u2019re all kind of assholes but it\u2019s not based on a huge variety of people but enough to sense a pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: (Unclear) loved T.S.

There\u2019s a lot of that in going to church. I don\u2019t believe what other people believe and I\u2019m never going to. I did <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">get to the point where I don\u2019t call myself religious, go to church and am part of that community. I just (unclear) that it\u2019s not going to be about believing the same things as other people for me. It\u2019s not going to be hearing things that make sense to me. In maybe one in four sermons I feel like actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB2\">speaks to me. Two and four \u2013 well, that\u2019s nice but not really relevant to my situation. (Unclear) usually think that they\u2019re just wrong.
