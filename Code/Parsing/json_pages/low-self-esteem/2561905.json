I lost it, and I had, like, just made it this winter, I didn\u2019t have it for that long, and I felt really stupid about losing it. I\u2019d just gotten so, so upset, like really upset. And Sydney was like, you know, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">like really pissed at him and I\u2019m like \u201cNo, it\u2019s not going to be okay,\u201d like. You know, I mean he asked me if I checked all these really, really impossible locations for it to be, and okay, of course it wasn\u2019t there. I think I lost it like we drove home from Chicago yesterday, and I think I left it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">at the restaurant, and I like called the restaurant and they didn\u2019t find it. But I was like like it was lost by the time we got home. And I was wearing it in the car, and I was wearing it to the restaurant, and I don\u2019t think I was wearing it after the restaurant, so now it\u2019s gone forever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Um-hmm. So you\u2019re mad at yourself for losing it, and you were sad because it was something you worked on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: And I was mad at Sydney because I felt like he was like \u201cNo, calm down,\u201d and I\u2019m like and he was like trivializing my emotions and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: So which piece feels like an overreaction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: The part where I was like crying about it and upset for like several hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Um-hmm. What do you think what would crying and upset be an appropriate reaction to for that amount of time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Something that was like worse consequences, I guess?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So kind of keeping it in perspective, I think. Because I think the feelings makes sense; the being sad, being angry at yourself for not checking to see if you had it whenever you were leaving. I think those feelings make sense, but you\u2019re right, the intensity feels out of proportion <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">for a scarf, even a scarf you made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: But it was just because I had no other winter scarves anymore and like you know, like the really light cashmere one that Sydney\u2019s parents got me for Christmas, but like I mean and I think that, granted, it\u2019s like probably the end of winter and I probably won\u2019t need it anymore until next <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">winter, but still like\u2026 And I guess I just felt like, you know because it\u2019s silly. I knit people things all the time, and like I just you know, like for like edifications and stuff and like when we were feeling bad and going through tough times, and it was just like I wish that someone would like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">knit something for me this time because like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, so I wonder if that\u2019s part of why the reaction was so intense, because it wasn\u2019t just about the physical scarf. Now it sounds like it got connected to this idea of feeling like your relationships aren\u2019t reciprocal? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Aww. And that might be something worth being upset about for a few hours. And how did one come about the other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Just because Bill was like offering like because Sydney really said he was thinking about getting me a scarf, or a scarf implement (ph), but he wanted to wait until I knew it was lost for sure and I think\u2026 Well, he told me that today; like that he gets annoyed when I, you know, get upset about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">these things and like expect him to make it better, but like I wanted to want it to get better and\u2026 (Sniffle sound)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561905\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">(Pause 00:03:48 to 00:04:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: And then I had to give a rehearsal (inaudible at 00:04:04); I was like still upset about it after rehearsal, and I felt like naked without my scarf because it actually was cold enough that I like I could have used it probably. But\u2026 I just feel like my whole life is falling apart and I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">deal with like even losing a scarf now. And it was fine when I lost the hat, but for some reason I wasn\u2019t fine when I lost the scarf. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">(Crying sound)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Well, so things I just heard you say, \u201cI feel like my whole life is falling apart.\u201d That\u2019s very different than \u201cI feel like I lost my scarf.\u201d You did lose your scarf, but your whole life is falling apart, that\u2019s a much different statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve just been thinking of that really, you know, in the past hour or so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Where is that thought coming from? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: The fact that I don\u2019t have a job and, you know, if God already knows. I think at this point I\u2019ve heard back from everything that I\u2019ve applied to though, like, and not a single interview for that job is\u2026 It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t applied for anything for the past, like, couple of weeks, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I\u2019ve just been so unmotivated. And like now I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m probably getting a kid in, because like one of the ones that we were babysitting for\u2026 And I\u2019m like wondering if it\u2019s not a I mean maybe it will be a good idea, maybe it will be a bad idea. I mean I don\u2019t want to\u2026 And I\u2019m just like what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">if I like fail at being able to take care of him and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re jumping from one thing to the next. You went from \u201cMy life is falling apart\u201d to \u201cI haven\u2019t applied to jobs\u201d to thinking about getting a kid. How are you going from one thing to the next in your head? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Well, in terms of like my apartment is messy and I believe I haven\u2019t dealt with a bunch of boxes and I feel like I need to deal with them before I get they get\u2026 But like they\u2019re going to be staying either sometime this week or next week, so like really soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: And just, you know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: So I think this is actually part of the pattern that leads to having really strong reactions that feel sometimes out of proportion with the trigger, because you connect things in a way that lumps everything all together, right? So there are a couple of things that you\u2019re consistently feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">pretty unhappy about: The state of your apartment, feeling pressure and panic about a job, the job search, and whether or not you can hold down a job. Those are big things looming and I think impact how competent you feel all of the time. And when other incidents like losing a scarf or, you know, getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">you know, some sort of challenge with the car, when those get mapped onto things that have to do with the apartment or finances, then you end up having a reaction about, I don\u2019t know, everything lumped together and it\u2019s really hard to process everything. It\u2019s hard to tolerate the distress of the really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200473\">big life questions every time something specific happens. Instead of ending up dealing with the problem at hand, you end up dealing with everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561905\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Um-hmm. And then I don\u2019t think that I was thinking about all of those things yesterday. I mean I\u2019ve been thinking about them today, but yesterday I thought I was really only thinking about the scarf slash (ph) and I guess friendships not being reciprocal, but it started with the scarf. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and it does, yeah. It starts with the kind of specific trigger, like realizing that you lost the scarf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like feeling like Sydney was telling me I was overreacting, like, (inaudible at 00:08:21) because that\u2019s all he like he like doesn\u2019t really make things that often and, ever, like. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s ever lost something that he like spent lots of time making and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So one part of you agrees with him that you were overreacting, and then another part feels really angry that he said that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">(Pause 00:08:38 to 00:08:48)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What did you want him to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">(Pause 00:08:50 to 00:08:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

I\u2019m not sure what he could have said to me at the end. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">(Sniffling sound)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: All of this\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Your overreacting, whether or not it feels partly true, definitely feels critical, judgmental.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And I know we had some e-mails back and forth about couples therapy, and I think that would really be a place to work on how you guys talk to one another and maybe some strategies for handling times when you are having a strong emotional reaction to something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Um-hmm. (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: And when he is having a strong reaction, emotional reaction, to something, and it goes both ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Now, see just I get mad when he like says things will be okay when he doesn\u2019t actually know things will be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well, what would not be okay about losing the scarf? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: The fact that I don\u2019t have a new one, and the fact that it took me forever to make it, and the fact that I didn\u2019t have that yarn anymore and I couldn\u2019t replace it with anything like it; like it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to replace. Like he\u2019s just going to get me a new scarf but it\u2019s not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Not going to be the same, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Or even close to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: And so in your mind does okay exact replacement? Is it okay? Is it really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Replacement as nice as the one I have. Maybe not exact, but like something comparably nice, which you can\u2019t just like buy at a regular store (sniffling sound). And like I found something nice-ish online, but it wasn\u2019t like as good as my scarf. I\u2019m just feeling like all that work had been (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">at 00:10:57).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. It sounds like you really wanted him to empathize with the work, the feeling of loss, whereas okay for him might mean, yeah, life will go on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a really vague term.

Yeah, but he says like other things a lot like now, earlier like, you know\u2026 I forgot what it was that he said; then I just got upset because I\u2019m like \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that. You don\u2019t actually know that.\u201d But like\u2026 I forgot (ph) why I was saying that and really saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">that. I don\u2019t usually lose things. and I usually take good care of scarves, and I\u2019m like \u201cHow do you even know that\u201d like? I\u2019ve lost things before, and the fact that I lost the scarf that this was originally based on, and that one was only after having it for a brief time, like maybe a couple of months... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">I lost it in a bookstore in Stamford, like right before I was going to Israel.

Sometimes when we\u2019re doing something out of our routine it\u2019s easier to lose track of details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Uh-huh. Still, I shouldn\u2019t have lost it. Like people do go away and like operate on less amounts of sleep and stuff and manage to not lose everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Lose everything? Did you lose everything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:14:13).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Ah. So then -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk) not to lose anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Ah, maybe sometimes, and there have probably been times when you\u2019ve gone away and haven\u2019t lost anything, and this wasn\u2019t one of those times unfortunately. I think what\u2019s important to notice and what gets you really upset and what escalates the feeling is when you move from what just happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">to globalizing it, right? So what just happened is, this past weekend you left your scarf behind someplace, maybe a restaurant, to globalize that, to you lose everything, you\u2019re not deserving. That makes it that changes the reality, right? You\u2019re\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">(Pause 00:15:06 to 00:15:12)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019ve lost some very expensive things before, like I\u2019ve lost my wallet. I\u2019ve lost a pair of glasses that I had just gotten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I mean that sounds really upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: It was like a couple hundred dollars. And, I don\u2019t know, I have been good about not losing this lately, and then this happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And you had this accident. Yeah, it\u2019s really upsetting when you lose track of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: And I just feel so stupid for having lost it. You know, if I had been smarter, then I wouldn\u2019t have lost it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There\u2019s a big difference between maybe being careless and being stupid. Listen to the language you\u2019re using; it\u2019s really hurtful language. If you called you know, if you called somebody else those names, I would say that was really inappropriate. It\u2019s also not okay for you to call <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">yourself those names; it\u2019s inappropriate. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561905\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Um-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Judge the behavior, not the person.

I can\u2019t just magically stop thinking that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: No, not magically, but you can train yourself to think in a way that is healthier for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: So when have I ever been able to like treat myself to think anything, like ever? Like when have I successfully been able to change the way I think, like? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t yet, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not capable of it. You\u2019ve never really been onboard to try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: I just hope that I\u2019m capable of controlling my emotions the same way that other people are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re capable of controlling your emotions, but I do think you\u2019re capable of controlling intentional thought; there\u2019s a difference. I\u2019m not asking you to control your feelings, I\u2019m asking you to listen to the language that you use to speak to yourself and choose your words <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">intentionally, which then, in turn, impacts how you feel. You do have control over what words you choose to use. You have never spoken to me in the way that you speak to yourself. You have never, certainly, out loud. How come it\u2019s okay for you? I mean you wouldn\u2019t come in here and say \u201cDr. Hallingford <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">(sp?), you\u2019re being really stupid,\u201d but you say that to yourself. And I think you do have control over the words you use, because I hear you talk to me in a different way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: I guess with everybody else in the world that I\u2019m not around them all the time and and I\u2019m around myself all the time, and I can only like be controlled for like so long before I go crazy. I think that I don\u2019t really usually have like such harsh thoughts about other people for any reason like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">enough to enough to do something really like upsetting for me to like start really thinking of terrible things about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: I\u2019d like for you to give yourself the same respect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: But I did something upsetting. I lost my scarf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It is upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">(Pause 00:18:48 to 00:19:12)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: (Sniffling sound)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: What you\u2019re doing is something called personalization, and it\u2019s kind of a speech technique or a thought pattern where you mistakenly ascribe a label to yourself based on behavior, or a kind of creating an enduring pattern out of a single incident. So it\u2019s a rather common way that people do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">this, right? So yeah, you lost a scarf. You left something behind. You\u2019ve left other things behind. And instead of keeping the description in your head, whereas you talk to yourself about that behavior, you\u2019re labeling yourself as a person, and that has a very different impact. You know, if you talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF2\">about yourself as like \u201cI made a mistake, you know, I miscalculated a number,\u201d that\u2019s very different than saying to yourself \u201cI\u2019m an idiot and I can never do math.\u201d It feels very different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">Here\u2019s a personal example. Last night I was rechecking my taxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561905\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Um-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And I noticed that in my Excel spreadsheet I had written the equation wrong, so I was calculating including a cell twice in the final equation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Now, this is, granted, big mistake. I had to fix it. I had to go back and tell the accountant that my numbers were off because I had entered the equation wrong. I felt badly about the mistake, but I felt silly about it, should have checked it before I originally sent the numbers to the accountant. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">It would have been a good thing to double-check first, these were mistakes, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an incompetent idiot; I do plenty of other things correctly. And yes, it was a mistake, but if I had spent the night thinking that I\u2019m completely incompetent and I\u2019m an idiot and I can never do anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD2\">right, I would have been a lot more upset, and it wouldn\u2019t have done any good, right? It wouldn\u2019t have me feeling that badly, talking to myself that way, wouldn\u2019t have fixed the error, and it wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent me from making an error that I\u2019m going to make in the future someday. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD3\">that\u2019s the difference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">And I also want you to kind of practice, because people make mistakes. We\u2019re always going to make mistakes. We\u2019re not going to be perfect in all the areas of our lives ever; nobody is. And we don\u2019t necessarily need to feel so badly about it if that\u2019s not especially when that\u2019s not going to prevent <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">a future mistake. Thinking about, okay, so you were careless, you didn\u2019t double-check to make sure you had all your belongings before you moved on to the next location, keeping that in mind, can actually help next time. I\u2019m pretty sure that next time I talk to my accountant I\u2019m going to double-check <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">those equations. And remembering that can help me do a better job next time without making me feel horrible, and that\u2019s what I wish for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Then you can make the mistake once and not make it again and like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: No, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to make mistakes again in my life, Georgia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: But they\u2019ll probably be different mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Whereas like losing things, like, you know, like I do go through a phase where I\u2019m really careful about checking my belongings, but it only lasts so long, because if it works then I would have never lost anything after I\u2019ve lost something the first time and that\u2019s obviously\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s pretty unrealistic to expect that there\u2019s going to be perfection at some point. I\u2019m going to make math mistakes again, of course I am. I\u2019m hopefully a lot longer to be living and working. You know, maybe I\u2019ll and hopefully I will be a little bit more careful in the future, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">I\u2019m never going to prevent a hundred mistakes on my own part, and neither are you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: But you\u2019ll probably prevent like you said you left mistakes to somebody else before double-checking it and looking at your\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know.

And it\u2019s like I feel like nothing will ever make me like be able to like never lose a belonging again, and that\u2019s what I want and it won\u2019t happen. (Sighing sound).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561905\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Ah.

Who has never left behind something or never will? Do you know that person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know anybody specific, but like it\u2019s not like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think they exist, Georgia, I really don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: I mean I have lots of friends, and like lots of them have never told me about leaving something behind. So it\u2019s possible that somewhere at least one of them has like never lost something before, or like (inaudible at 00:24:10) at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Maybe, but anything never always ever again feels pretty unlikely to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: Those absolutes just feel really unlikely. Maybe not impossible, but having reasonable expectations for yourself is part of being able to be accepting of yourself, and expecting perfection in any area from here on out feels a little unreasonable. I think it feels like you\u2019re setting yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">up for failure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s like not losing I mean behind something like not people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something to work toward. Finding a way to set yourself up for a success; you know, what might help you to be more careful.

They told me that I didn\u2019t get an interview or anything and like gave the job to someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Those are really hard to get those and keep trying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DF\">(Pause 00:43:59 to 00:44:13)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E1\">CLIENT: I just feel so worthless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E3\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E5\">CLIENT: Well, [I\u2019m not] (ph) like a nice person or anything else, like. There is nothing likable about me. You could make comparisons and like, you know, I\u2019m not like the worst person ever, and like that doesn\u2019t make someone good, like. You know, you don\u2019t get points for like not being Hitler; like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201E51\">that\u2019s sort of expected.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561905\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Umm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">CLIENT: You know? (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019d say it\u2019s far from Hitler.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201ED\">CLIENT: Most people don\u2019t commit genocide and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EF\">THERAPIST: That is true.

I\u2019m not good at anything valuable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F7\">THERAPIST: What do you want to be good at?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FB\">(Pause 00:45:27 to 00:45:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FD\">CLIENT: (Crying). I don\u2019t even know. Like all I want to be is not overweight anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FF\">THERAPIST: So as a place to start, doing the things that you have control over, use some of the things that you\u2019ve talked about today. Your skill in knitting; you\u2019re not the only person that has that skill, but it is a valuable skill. Like you said, you know, your scarf was so much nicer than what most <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201FF1\">people have because of a skill that you\u2019ve cultivated, the time that you\u2019re willing to put into something. That, that\u2019s something you have control over, and it is a nice skill that you have. So maybe spending some time\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20201\">You know, I know a couple of weeks ago you mentioned getting together with someone and doing a knitting circle and knitting together with a friend, you know. You\u2019re in a pretty low place right now. Doing something simple like that, a way to reconnect with someone and to reconnect with a skill that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202011\">do have, that is part of what makes you a unique and a valuable person. So doing something active to take advantage of the skill you have, and doing something active to work toward a goal you have, being in better physical shape. Let\u2019s focus on the doable things right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20203\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20205\">THERAPIST: Because, you know, if you can just think about putting a small chunk of energy into those two things each day and start to work yourself kind of out of this feeling of hopelessness and helplessness that you\u2019re in\u2026 And I\u2019d like to help you build on those, and it feels like you have more to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202051\">hang onto, but that\u2019s a place to start. Two very identifiable steps you can take. Can you work on those this week for me until I see you next?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20207\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20209\">THERAPIST: Does that feel reasonable? I don\u2019t want to put too much on your plate, but I do want to put you in charge of something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020B\">CLIENT: I did take the stairs today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Excellent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">CLIENT: I decided to walk to the subway rather than drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you\u2019re already doing it before I even gave you an assignment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m supposed to be getting together with a friend tomorrow to knit, but I have to double-check if that\u2019s happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20215\">THERAPIST: Okay. And if that if that friend can\u2019t get together, I\u2019d like you to take your knitting needles and do some anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20217\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20219\">THERAPIST: I think it would be great to get together with a friend to do it. If that friend needs to cancel or reschedule, commit to yourself that you\u2019ll take out your needles and do some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019re that, and you have complete control over it. And it is you know, that\u2019s a pretty special talent you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F\">CLIENT: I feel like there are at least like a million other knitters in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20221\">THERAPIST: And there are also many more that can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20223\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20225\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re right.
