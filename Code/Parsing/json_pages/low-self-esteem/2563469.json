I have a lot of it. Couldn\u2019t do it for the last couple weeks but I [inaudible at 00:00:10] roll so I need to spend this week doing that because I also know I can\u2019t just cram this. I need to actually do it. So woo hoo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: This is the retest, the retake?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: No, this is the final exam, the take-home exam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh it\u2019s take home? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yes. Two questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Oh is that the project award? Are they going to publish it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly. So I should visit (ph) that. And we\u2019re starting again the tide distributions. I\u2019m not sure what those are but some of them have been turning up something. Oh that sounds cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh in Time Square?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yes, I guess, yes. Sounds cool. [inaudible at 00:00:51] other ways so, because basically everything eventually comes to normal exclusion except for certain things that don\u2019t. Yes, [inaudible at 00:00:56] to normal exclusions. Oh this looks interesting. And there apparently is a way mathematically <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">to convert that to normal distribution and use it the same exact way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes. Yes, Time Square\u2019s one of those, recall the non-parametric statistics where because you use those for such because they don\u2019t, because they\u2019re not normally distributed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Oh good because that\u2019s what I\u2019m going for. Fantastic because that\u2019s what I want to do. So I got excited. I went looking at, I think I told you this, I went looking online this not very good [inaudible at 00:01:40] $1,000 course. They offer advanced statistics, which Concord does not. I [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">at 00:01:50] hear your prereqs and this is a list of them. They go all the way back down to, so I did pre-calc, then calc, then advanced calc, then I guess pre-advanced statistics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: For advanced statistics?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes. I said okay, I guess that makes sense, right? What we\u2019re doing here involves curves and calculus can give us a greater level of precision than any other math can. As I understand it as the calculus does. The idea of calculus is how close to zero can you get and can ever get? How close to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">zero can you get? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I was watching Cosmos the other day, the one about Haley, and Haley\u2019s always been an astronomer. As a kid his father has encouraged this, ideas, his father funded his trip to map the stars of the Southern Hemisphere so he could completed the star map and sail the ocean and go anywhere in the world. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">Took him years because where he lived it was storming all the time, so he would [inaudible at 00:02:56]. It took him a year. So [inaudible at 00:02:57] a couple months to go to it, and the screwed (ph) option has always been played as a good measure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">And so he comes back, he comes back, and he\u2019s with this other group of mathematicians and astronomers and they\u2019re discussing why orbits are elliptical. Clearly they\u2019re elliptical and in the end there has to be some mathematical explanation of this. That\u2019s so somebody can express this in their equation <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">just so we can predict times. And this guy, [inaudible at 00:03:34] something like that, he says yes, I can try to raise that. He said yes, yes I\u2019m working on that. Almost got it. But he never actually produced the math. [inaudible at 00:03:45].<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">Now Robert Hooke is the guy who claimed he invented gravity after Newton came forth and said hey, gravity, no such ah, here\u2019s the person who stole my idea. And the people said Newton, man, that\u2019s not cool, because Newton\u2019s the new kid. And Newton said well fuck all y\u2019all and went off to live in seclusion. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">Haley knows about him. There\u2019s one way that this guy can get him out and he goes up to his place and says hey, I know you\u2019re a recluse and known as a difficult person. This friend of mine said the other day from his research thinks that you probably did something wrong as a spectrum (ph) and this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">a real difficulty, a drag on your [inaudible at 00:04:21].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: This is Hooke or Newton?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Newton. And Haley goes to see him and says hey, you\u2019re an amazing we\u2019re trying to figure out this thing about the elliptical orbits and Newton says oh yes, there\u2019s an inverse square law. And he said what? And he said yes, the orbits [inaudible at 00:04:39] inverse square law. I figured out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">if you use [inaudible at 00:04:44] we\u2019ve got a ring down here somewhere. Can we, can we do this? He said yes, here\u2019s the proof; here\u2019s the math. All of this is calculus; I made it fun. I still haven\u2019t shared it because when I shared with someone, someone stole my idea so this is mine. And Haley said <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">okay but I need to get this published and then it\u2019s definitely yours and no one would be saying oh I invented calculus because I\u2019m here with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And so eventually he convinced him to do it and because of Haley reaching out, guiding, and convincing him to share his work with the world again, we have calculus. We have astrophysics, [inaudible at 00:05:19] -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: This is all in that show Cosmos?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes, and also the Laws of Motion that he discovered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Is that right? So that guy Haley went out and found him and got him to tell the whole story -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes, and then he figures out this comet and it\u2019s called it Haley\u2019s Comet. It\u2019s when he realized they\u2019re also on an elliptical orbit. He said it\u2019s going to come back every 76 years. And as [inaudible at 00:05:42] this is the first time science did something that religion never could, which was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">prophecy. Raw, specific prophecy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What [inaudible at 00:05:56].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen now. Seventy-six years from now a comet will fly over the sky as a ball on fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yes. Comet\u2019s a really good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes, seriously. And this giant ice cube\u2019s very nice. Giant ice cubes float in space, frozen rock and whatnot, and as it gets closer to the sun it starts burning off and that\u2019s the tail that you see is all those chemicals and other things burning off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yes, being -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Dipping (ph) in the sun has boiled essentially so eventually the comets will stop. So this will show how easily a comet can get pulled off course as it comes close enough to a certain planet. Sums it <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:06:38] pull it in its orbit enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:06:40] be a tug of sliding by its orbit. Not even at the surface the tug is slightly off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Just [inaudible at 00:06:41] cutting in? There\u2019s still enough pull from whatever?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yes, especially Jupiter with its size. Things that fly by Jupiter get bent. God, it\u2019s a bitch. It is, it is. I mean the universe is an amazing Cosmos; you\u2019re right about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Now what is it? Is it dramatizations of these kind of ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s certainly illustrated frames of some of these stories and this is what [inaudible at 00:07:08] thinks happened. They don\u2019t hire actors, they\u2019re just drawings, stylistic ink colored wood cut sort of drawings. And deGrasse Tyson narrates, [inaudible at 00:07:19].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yes, it\u2019s the show. So that\u2019s the show on PBS? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: It\u2019s on Fox actually now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s on Fox. Maybe that\u2019s why I got confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s Rupert Murdoch\u2019s apology letter to America. He says whoops. He says we realized we actually have made a problem. We\u2019ve lived with the conservatives and Tea Party gab for too long and now they\u2019ve raised a generation of religious zealots who don\u2019t believe in science. And Bill Nye <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">is right; we are going to fall behind scientific and technology in the world very quickly if we don\u2019t fix this. We need to start doing something about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Very interesting that it\u2019s on Fox.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yes, that is very much like here\u2019s what people believe for reasons of religion. And here\u2019s why we now know how it works. And the sponsors (ph) say can you believe this, because they had no idea and they were afraid and so their views were based on fear. And now, we\u2019re not. They can be based <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">on wonder and wow isn\u2019t that amazing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s the same show that used to be on PBS right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes, Carl Sagan hosted it. And now Neil deGrasse Tyson holds [inaudible at 00:08:29] as chair and he also hosts. The U.S. does have some incredibly intelligent human beings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yes, I was wondering why I saw it all the sudden on I thought it was some play on that or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:08:43] developed a skit, Chemotology University, and it did quite well. So that was good. What else, what else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Well yes the importance of math and calculus -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yes, I want to do more math. And I said okay if I\u2019m going to do math, even if I\u2019m doing a night class and I\u2019m busy enough that I\u2019m only getting a C in math and of course I\u2019m actually learning the calculus, that would be great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What about []? What do you want to see done for credit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: About []? I mean it was interesting but they don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: They didn\u2019t have it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Well they\u2019ll have it. They\u2019ve got everything. But the dude\u2019s a mathematician; he skips all sorts of steps. He says always to do this. I said well wait hold up, why can\u2019t we do that? That\u2019s interesting. What you\u2019ve done there is a very complicated formula and it used to be extremely simple. What <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">did you do? I don\u2019t immediately saw what he did because you say oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">And he said it\u2019s [inaudible at 00:09:53] due to permutations. He said what do you have? N-factorial over N-factorial times R-factorials something like that? And he said yes, well the N-factorials they cancel each other out. He did this thing where he said well since, I don\u2019t know I can\u2019t really explain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">it. It was a very good trick because he got out of school to know enough to [inaudible at 00:10:18].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">But, yes, I watched that. I\u2019ve been watching that, I\u2019ve been watching the Science Show. I\u2019m just watching stuff about math and science and trying to be more literal about all of that because it\u2019s also fascinating, the ability to understand and know that stuff, the quest to know it. Finally to understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">that the explosion have we talked about it in here before?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ve talked about it before, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Recently because I was watching a video on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Oh no, not [inaudible at 00:10:54].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: So, people said it\u2019s the field that gives things mass, right? But these fields have popped into matter resistance all the time [inaudible at 00:11:09] directions and quirks. It\u2019s not so scared (ph), which was the sad thing about it. Nothing should pop in and out of existence. There it is. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">it is field particles all around us. It\u2019s the way that it contracts with certain spectrums under electromagnetic, certain parts of the magnetic spectrum that creates the illusion of mass, essentially. We actually feel resistance as the field and that\u2019s how much mass we have. The levels with which we <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">interact with the field is how much mass we have. That\u2019s how mass works. Photons out of the mass they\u2019re not affected by the field. So it\u2019s not that they have to think about <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Stop. Stop for a minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: although we have the mass it\u2019s not affected by the field, is that? They aren\u2019t affected by the field, which is right by the mass. The particles don\u2019t interact with the photons in any way, because the photons are strong in their way, whereas they interact with us in all the electron energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Oh I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: These are things to remember. We are a collection of magnet connections, that\u2019s pretty much we\u2019re mostly empty space, we\u2019re mostly empty space. So fascinating. So Erickson used to talk about this idea of the self being an illusion and this [inaudible at 00:12:42] is being at a point where <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">you see yourself as you would in an illusion. And that\u2019s really curious when you take a look at it. But who knows? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">It isn\u2019t even [inaudible at 00:12:55] itself. How do we receive any practical [inaudible at 00:13:04]. It\u2019s all well and good. Starting that talk, series on web online course for waking up and guiding spirituality without religion, I\u2019m thinking Bethany (ph) I love you but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll stop trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">to tell your (ph) motivational speaker, just one more God. I want a few things to say of spiritual development. It also will be, depending, I think quite relevant. Such is my thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">Opened my eyes to a lot of ideas I got before [inaudible at 00:13:42]. My favorite bit is some talk on the nature of God and then one of the other atheists are [more saddled] (ph) to reason. People lose thought as gears; there\u2019s a new tribe out that support people [inaudible at 00:14:03]. And then there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">Deepak Chopra and then some female version of the other guy. So I\u2019m going to try to out and test the working (ph) lecture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">So let\u2019s talk about the nature of God. Deepak Chopra, I\u2019ve always loathed Deepak Chopra. He\u2019s very much describing spirituality in these literary terms. And he\u2019s the Kant of quantum physics, says the following sorts of things therefore we can then surmise this stuff nature of reality on a metaphysical <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">level and what is God and those sorts of things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">And Sam Harris says first off we can\u2019t even talk about nature of God. I think it was implicitly part of that this was the god of Abraham we\u2019re talking about; this is the God most people are talking about when they say God in this country. So let\u2019s not talk about some flimsy idea of what God could be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">hypothetically let\u2019s not he says being [inaudible at 00:14:59] in quantum physics that would be like oh this is what\u2019s this. And Sam Harris says you\u2019re not a quantum physicist though. And basically every word out of your mouth just firmly confirms that. And Deepak\u2019s just oops kind of going actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">no it\u2019s this, it\u2019s the other thing, this other thing, and Sam Harris said saying it louder and relentlessly won\u2019t make it true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">He said and by the way can you bring down the volume a little bit? And the moderator says oh yes, here you go. It\u2019s a little bit of Sam Harris. He says you\u2019re just wrong and that\u2019s I\u2019m not going to shirk but and also what are you doing? That seems strange. I don\u2019t know eventually that\u2019s the thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">you can\u2019t just say quantum mechanics has some stupid stuff in it and just cash out all this other stupid stuff you want me to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Oh what, his point was that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Deepak has a lot of metaphysical ideas, which are always ideas, which he states as facts. And he claims there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t possibly know. And Deepak uses some arrogance. He says you are less likely, you are farthest likely to see arrogance at a scientific convention then you are to seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">nudity. He says everyone hedges their comments. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some here that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: took a lot of the classes. You know the views as long as I have that clearly need to be verified. I\u2019m very excited about it but it could be wrong and since everyone, no one wants to be wrong. As to the point of science let\u2019s not be wrong. Let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">He\u2019s into reasoning. I\u2019ve seen the equation; I roughly understand the equation. I know how the equation reads but I don\u2019t know why it does what it does, why it does what it does. But it\u2019s very good. Do you know the concept of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Okay, so essentially it\u2019s the algorithm for the equation, bases [inaudible at 00:17:23] equation or theorem, bases theorem. Essentially it\u2019s the probability that this new information should change all the new probabilities you have based on the known universe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">So this is for instance, the way he says that. It\u2019s takes place at [inaudible at 00:17:43]; he says it\u2019s just some guy, he delivers rather poorly, he writes rather poorly and reads it off on cue cards and you can video it. The explanation is good but his jokes are kind of flat. So to explain the piece, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">these are all possible known universes in terms of everything you could possibly know about the universe. And he says so let\u2019s just then take a look at someone says to me hey, [inaudible at 00:18:12] was a nightclub singer. Now in all the universes in English someone approaches and says this, he draws <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">a circle around saying this is the universe in which someone tells him [inaudible at 00:18:22] was a nightclub singer. I say I\u2019ve never heard of her being one, there\u2019s no evidence she\u2019s never been one. As far as I know in the known universe the likelihood she\u2019s a nightclub singer is almost zero. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F3\">therefore there\u2019s no reason to change our view of reality. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">And in this universe in which she finds a box of photographs which is all Madison, looks like she was singing in a nightclub. There\u2019s an elephant (ph) under these universes. We have the big universe, which is everything. Within that we have contained the universe wherein someone tells him Madison was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">a nightclub singer and may or may not have been. The other universe is the one where she finds the box of photographs. There\u2019s an overlap of these two universes in the entire realm. [inaudible at 00:19:17] defense, we say okay we cut out the entire order because put that in the relevance of this current <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A12\">situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">And now we have B, C, and D. You have B being where you [inaudible at 00:19:26], C being the overlap and D being [inaudible at 00:19:29]. And there\u2019s some recon (ph) with D that didn\u2019t, the other D that found the photographs, so that happened. And now we have a universe wherein we\u2019re told she\u2019s a nightclub <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">singer and this section here is much larger a probability that she actually was a nightclub singer. So I actually changed my, actually updated my reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">And that\u2019s the idea that it\u2019s not all valuable. How likely is it that this should be included in my understanding? [inaudible at 00:19:52] it\u2019s awesome, which we\u2019re also living and it\u2019s fascinating. How likely is it that I can change my mind? It\u2019s a good thought process; it\u2019s working through what do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">we know about the universe. And we\u2019re not looking at that as if [inaudible at 00:20:12] was even more ridiculous, even more ridiculous. Athletes thanking God for their win, super idiots. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">The circus analogy really drills down. So I need all possible universes and I need all possible universes in which there is a god. And we need all possible universes in which there is that specific God in which you are giving thanks. Then, all the known universes which [inaudible at 00:20:42] exist <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">to you when you give thanks intervene in your daily life. And now further drills down to a universe where that God exists especially in your daily life and cares about the outcome of specific football games and not others. What is that? What are the chances in fact that that\u2019s what it is? I\u2019m thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A72\">pretty small, pretty small. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">And now, and to answer the first three problems what if we\u2019re wrong? Well what if you\u2019re wrong? We could all be wrong about any number of [inaudible at 00:21:15] or lack thereof. There\u2019s no way to tell other than to say there\u2019s no evidence that we should believe in them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yes. What do you say, I mean I realize we talked a lot about, there\u2019s something really about the kind of the force of volition in the world, the what is it all, what is it that you think you\u2019re working out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: What is it that I\u2019m working out? That\u2019s a good question. I wondered that because it is a big focus in my life recently. It really resurfaces like this is something that needs to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Is that what it is? It needs to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: It needs to go. It needs to go. It\u2019s bad for us and it\u2019s dangerous. It makes the world a more dangerous place because people are making irrational decisions that seem rational to them based on an irrational framework which they were given, which was given to them. That\u2019s what [inaudible at 00:22:15] <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">people realize. Oh we believe, we can believe because that\u2019s what you were told when you were a kid and you were malleable. That\u2019s why you believe in all this stuff. The Virgin [inaudible at 00:22:27] was old. Look at someone like me looking at it from the outside. Look at Scientology. When you look <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B12\">at Scientology, some skeptic [inaudible at 00:22:37]. Apply that to your own faith. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re sure do you think that you\u2019re doing do you do that with yourself? Is that one of your customs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: In other words are you sort of saying you\u2019re going after your own religious kind of upward, like the stuff that you\u2019ve learned over the years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: To a degree, yes. Listen that stuff is there and it\u2019s, I have empirical evidence that it since I was born that it continues on throughout one\u2019s life and anecdotal evidence that this is the end. Empirical evidence in my friends and already closed to them. Why although your actual friends will <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">still identify [inaudible at 00:23:10] keeping them out. I\u2019m sure there are many things [inaudible at 00:23:18] out of their childhood Godparent. They asked me to be Godparent to their daughter. I said yes, I\u2019ll do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019m not going to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m not going exactly. But, [laughs] yes. I can\u2019t say I offered, I think that would be the responsible thing. Where are Mommy and Daddy now? No one knows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: How much does religion do you think still affect you? How much do you think your religious upbringing affects you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: I thought most of the day and I was talking about this to Ginny. I can\u2019t stop blessing my food. And it\u2019s the same rhyme they teach you as a child. Dear Holy Father, thank you for this day, thank you for this food, bless it [inaudible at 00:23:53], in Jesus Christ Amen. Boom. Every. Single. Time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C11\">And it\u2019s in there and I say it and I say Amen. And I have to, at night, at night, when I go to focus on positive things and hope for the future, I still, I have the same formula. Here\u2019s this ritual but these are things to think about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: What do you do? What do you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to talk about that. But it\u2019s premature and [inaudible at 00:24:30] down over the years but it\u2019s sort of like varied -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Varied kind of ritual almost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly, sort of a [inaudible at 00:24:36] role. But still it\u2019s, I have to tie it from beginning to end with the Mormon format, which is Dear Holy Father, blah, blah, blah. And then praying in Jesus Christ Amen, blah, blah, blah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Whether you like it or not you do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yes. Those aren\u2019t beings I ascribe in a note. Dear Heavenly Father, Dear Creator God of the Mormon faith who had sex with lots of women and made children so I could be here on this earth for some great time. Really I mean how many, how far do you have to go? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Well I was thinking that in some way it\u2019s like an attempt to kind of deprogram or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: Oh absolutely. I want to be deprogrammed of this stuff. It\u2019s awful. I have people on my thread I said Easter Bunny, it\u2019s Facebook, I said Easter Bunny another myth I would immediately tell my children about but there\u2019s no such thing as the Easter Bunny. I said there\u2019s too [inaudible at 00:25:38] <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">because why [roll down] (ph) to children? How many kids realize that adults lie to them all the time, that there\u2019s been a group conspiracy of adults who [inaudible at 00:25:47] all these mythical beings? For what reason? I mean for some of them it was fun probably and some of them thought it would be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D12\">fun for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s kind of why the hell are we putting this all into people\u2019s heads?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">CLIENT: Right, why are we putting ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And then it gets stuck in the head and then you can\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yes, Santa Claus from all above, we pulled out sorry, there\u2019s not a Santa Claus, there isn\u2019t. [inaudible at 00:26:13] Josh Dawkins refers to this very much. This is Santa Claus? Wow, let\u2019s reason that through. How many chimneys are there in your neighborhood do you think? Let\u2019s pick some numbers. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">Then how many neighborhoods just in this part of the state are going to have chimneys now? Okay, how much, how fast do you have to go between chimneys to do this? And if you get to that chimney and drop with the presents can you do all of that in one night? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">It\u2019s magic. Well, given that magic isn\u2019t real, right, or there\u2019s no reason to believe magic is real, think about this logically. Also reindeer, do you know of any reindeer that fly? Really? Other than the ones you\u2019ve heard about have you heard of reindeer flying because no one else has. No one\u2019s ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB1\">seen a reindeer fly. Not ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: Never, never happened. That\u2019s interesting. So I think we have to surmise that that part is a story, right? Yes, okay, interesting. So maybe it\u2019s all a story. Why wouldn\u2019t someone tell you it\u2019s a story? Probably because they thought you would like it because you were young and they thought you\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF1\">say oh this is fun. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And would make you feel a certain way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yes, maybe you\u2019re crying but don\u2019t let your kids ask about Santa Claus. I think much lore is very much offensive. I loved believing in Santa Claus; I want children to be able to believe in Santa Claus as well. And I thought I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a fair trade. You loved it, that\u2019s great. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E31\">then you say still your child to trust implicitly? This is what they think is real.

Why does Santa give poor kids the worst presents and fewer of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Oh boy you\u2019re so right, you\u2019re so right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s so interesting about that. ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: We really have such a different feeling depending on who, depending on the context in which it exists too.

He\u2019s in a flashback to his chemistry professor, one of the [inaudible at 00:30:11] chemistry professor, and he\u2019s with the woman he\u2019s dating and he\u2019s calculating all the bits and pieces of what makes a human body, the [counter rules] (ph) and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F91\">percentages, everything. It\u2019s 99.9 something percent is accounted for. He said this little bit we don\u2019t know what that is. And the woman says what about what if that\u2019s the soul? And he says what do you mean it\u2019s the soul? This is science. We\u2019re missing something. We\u2019re missing a very small percentage <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F92\">of something. We don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s got to be something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">Regardless, so what bothers me is that I have friends who are still saying, one of my friends, one periphery of my friend\u2019s circle, honestly wished everyone a happy Resurrection Day. I said yes, well when did you I said that didn\u2019t happen likely. Let\u2019s circle this truth. Let\u2019s go around it a few times <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB1\">and ask questions and look at it until we see what it really is. Okay, so happy Resurrection Day because Jesus Christ came back from the dead [inaudible at 00:31:45]. Okay, let\u2019s look at the evidence for this. First off let\u2019s look for any corresponding evidence. Do we have any situations where someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB2\">died and came back from the dead with their wounds still intact? Is that ever written or recorded anywhere? Never. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">Okay, okay so that\u2019s interesting. Let\u2019s get to [inaudible at 00:32:03]. So in the known universe that doesn\u2019t happen, but in the scripture they\u2019re saying maybe it did. Okay so fine. So now given that we know this never happens then we have one universe in which it can happen and we have this specific <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD1\">version. Okay, now what further evidence do we have that it happened? Well, three of his best friends said they saw him afterwards. And he said yes I fucking died. And I\u2019m not bad anymore but I\u2019m going mad at them so whatever. Peace. And the woman said how many came to America? And he said I\u2019m a spirit <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD2\">ghost. Let\u2019s all bow to Jesus; that\u2019s me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: And by the way people laugh at that. A lot of Christians would laugh at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: They think oh that\u2019s funny. I said yes that is funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a crazy idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: That\u2019s crazy, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: But this other one is credible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: But this stuff, though, this is all the stuff where and the trinity idea. So God sent himself to Earth to sacrifice himself to himself so as to protect us all from himself. That\u2019s the most ridiculous psycho bullshit in the world. So again, they\u2019ll all resist [inaudible at 00:33:26] for very <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201091\">real trouble? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">THERAPIST: But what about your friend that posted that or whoever was it a friend of yours?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yes, and just I said Felicity I like you but this is crazy. I respect you as a human being, as an intelligent human being, but you just said something that is insane. And I don\u2019t know how to approach that, to say hey that\u2019s crazy. It didn\u2019t happen. I mean, again, what\u2019s the evidence we have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Do you know that Felicity\u2019s not insane ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: Yes, I understand; she said the same thing. And again this is what I\u2019m saying she\u2019s a rational person making irrational decisions because her framework is irrational. She\u2019s in the right kinds of stuff because [inaudible at 00:34:19]. And it\u2019s just the thing of, I explain to people now the game <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201111\">of reality, talk about playing, which really is a game that I played in college. As I said I\u2019m willing to leave the room with that information. If I\u2019m making some shit up just to have fun with you just because you\u2019re going to believe me for a few seconds, I\u2019m going to tell you I was kidding. I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201112\">going to say oh shit, Leif left thinking that three printers (ph) can make eggs you can eat right now or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">[inaudible at 00:35:02] you tell someone that and they\u2019ll say you\u2019re a fucking idiot. That\u2019s not true. Let\u2019s Google that. Oh it\u2019s not on Google. Why the fuck would Google lie about that? What\u2019s up with Fred? Is he a pathological liar? No, I was joking and I forgot to tell you. Oops. But let\u2019s get with <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201131\">reality. We love reality [inaudible at 00:35:19] so often because she was so bad at it. Then one day I was talking, I was so excited about yes I vetted (ph) three printers and they\u2019re coming because they got three printers, amazing. She said no, not this time. I said you know three printers are actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201132\">really amazing. And she said, no, no such thing. And I couldn\u2019t help laughing because it was so funny. I said this is I\u2019m telling you the truth and now you don\u2019t believe every time I lie to you, you eat it up and now I tell you the truth and you say no. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">THERAPIST: The one time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: The one time. So, and then she found out they existed and she said he was right. They\u2019re real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: Well you know what comes to mind to me is the way you describe kind of how bad information shaped Kevin\u2019s life for instance. How it really profoundly -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">CLIENT: Snake juice. He still believes in snake juice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s, what is <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">CLIENT: Snake oil. Snake oil salesman. You know, the traveling salesman who says oh this is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: Oh yes. What does he subscribe to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: Cider apple apple cider vinegar is his current thing, which cures anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: Oh really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: Yes. He\u2019ll say oh just drink apple cider vinegar and hork (ph) out all that phlegm every day and spit it all in the sink. And it\u2019s a horrible sound and he horks (ph) up everything and spits. He does that for a few minutes until he says yes, cleared out all the mucus because he\u2019s got a [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201271\">at 00:36:51]. All right man, you\u2019re weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">But again, and the one that really gets me, the one Jesus fuck-up, is hearsay of three dudes who were his best friends that had a lot to gain by making him go away, who had written down 60 years after it happened. They had 60 years to come up with a story that everyone believes. Pathological liars, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201291\">you might know something about this. Fascinating watching across [inaudible at 00:37:31] lying, right? Pathological liars. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">So don\u2019t you lie and pretend, whatever. Fuck I don\u2019t care if you never talk about it. In order to lie you need to do something very important. You need to hold two conflicting bits of information in your head at the same time, right, the reality and what you\u2019re obscuring it with. The more complex the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B1\">lie, the more conflicting information you have to hold together in your head. The gray matter, that part of your brain that is critical decision-making and all those very useful things. White matter carries connections between your brain. The more white matter you have the more complicated information <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B2\">you can hold in your head at the same time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D\">Pathological liars have such a great amount of white matter that information is just being connected and held. [inaudible at 00:38:19] of information that\u2019s being held together naturally therefore a lot of pathological liars don\u2019t know they\u2019re lying when they\u2019re lying. They\u2019re used to doing it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D1\">the brain says no it\u2019s all here, I got all the information. They can\u2019t distinguish the truth from reality any more. Said you\u2019re on a roll, [inaudible at 00:38:44], still we should forgive him; well we have to forgive him to a degree, really. You can\u2019t help what you\u2019re doing and we also can\u2019t trust you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D2\">That is a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F\">THERAPIST: With the teacher?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20131\">CLIENT: Yes, yes.

Yes, exactly. Now you can\u2019t be trusted. That\u2019s all. Now it\u2019s important. How do we know the crazies? Facial tattoos? But that\u2019s all insanity. Yes, I\u2019ve got some time to do math every day this week. Just not [inaudible at 00:39:29].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yes, well what are you feeling about it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20139\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019ve got to get a 100 on this, which you recall it possibly will return (ph) itself, and do a couple retakes. I\u2019ll probably retake them this week or next week.

I\u2019ll take the third [inaudible at 00:40:03] extra points, shouldn\u2019t count very much. I might even choose if that didn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t hurt.

I mean I know my potential to fuck it up is so high and as long as I don\u2019t fuck it up and I pass this course I\u2019ll have my college degree. And my job search restarts in earnest and I can call the places that wanted to talk to me before but couldn\u2019t. Okay now, see now I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201411\">this degree now so now we can talk. I can [inaudible at 00:40:54] off success and say hey man, you haven\u2019t gotten back to me so I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not interested. If you are, we need to talk now because I\u2019m actively looking at jobs. Player, the place I worked and left, had massive layoffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20143\">THERAPIST: Is that right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20145\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. Two women I hired are still there and one of the guys I hired jumped ship for another company, as did other people. But I\u2019m laughing because this is part of the West Coast part of it too. So it\u2019s basically nothing now. It\u2019s just another, once again riches give out, well, time to start <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201451\">a new company.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20144-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20144-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yes.

And it might be interesting to say hey Josh, now that all those other assholes you [inaudible at 00:41:59] are gone, now we can have a discussion. First off, you can\u2019t talk to me the way you talked to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201511\">me in the past. This whole raising your voice, trying to be intimidating and take your best shot well you just can\u2019t do that. And the thing I would say this time -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">THERAPIST: Communicate better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20155\">CLIENT: Yes. And it\u2019s not only with me; that\u2019s with everybody. That\u2019s with everybody in this office. If I see you being a jerk I\u2019m going to call it out. I\u2019m going to pulling Pete to intervene on your behalf. I suppose that would be interesting. Hey now do you need me? Now that everyone, all the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201551\">people are gone I think I can make this work for you. I just want a piece of the pie. And easily, having been there I can easily be on the same levels as Larry, easily. There is no reason -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20157\">THERAPIST: They still have that position posted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20159\">CLIENT: Yes. I thought could I do that? Could I go back there? I said I probably could, if it were a different environment which maybe it is now. But I think I would honestly say we have to make some changes. We have to paint. The moral here sucks because your office fucking sucks. We can make it suck <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201591\">a little less. I know you have worried about the number of water bottles we go through, people drinking water here, come on man. Seriously, health insurance sucks, there\u2019s no 401K, there\u2019s nothing. So we have to make some choices. Let\u2019s make some quality of life decisions. What\u2019s the game? I don\u2019t give <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201592\">a shit what the game is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015B\">THERAPIST: But it was, it must have been a very sharp contrast from Melody, the economy, the environment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015D\">CLIENT: Oh very sharp contrast. It would be like and he said this isn\u2019t Melody. We\u2019re not running things loosey-goosey. I said yes, that\u2019s true. But you also panic in the same way they do. You say oh they do things this way; well yes, but you get the same in results, and actually potentially worse <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015D1\">because at Melody at least everyone loves each other. At least everyone\u2019s there to better the team. At [] it\u2019s just I think they on your back if most of us [inaudible at 00:44:43] team were gone. I think and actually I\u2019m throwing around this [inaudible at 00:44:46] I\u2019m here; these are the terms now <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015D2\">but they\u2019re different. And we need to fucking paint because it stinks (ph) plus it\u2019s fucking depressing. Your turnover rate is awful.

Man, we\u2019re busy right now. And at least when Orlando was the CEO, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201611\">he\u2019d call Josh out on points like you should not be involved.

You could go into the server closet but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20177\">THERAPIST: [Laughing] Not quite what you\u2019re looking for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20179\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:46:58] over in the back -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Executive meeting in the server closet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly. We\u2019d pull some chairs into the door up and around the corner of [inaudible at 00:47:03] wall and would say pretend that I had anything to do with <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017F\">THERAPIST: What was it? Was he just trying to save a lot of money or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20181\">CLIENT: Yes, he\u2019s very much like you say. His entire plan is to subsist. Not to excel but to subsist. And part of me says that makes sense. But again, I don\u2019t want to subsist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20183\">THERAPIST: People still need the way that you subsist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20185\">CLIENT: Yes. People still need to want to come here. That\u2019s actually the thing. People need to want to come here and right now they don\u2019t. And specifically I don\u2019t. And many people don\u2019t so they keep leaving. So clearly, so clearly -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20187\">THERAPIST: So what, you said, so you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re fearful that this week will go -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20189\">CLIENT: Will go poorly and I won\u2019t pass the course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018B\">THERAPIST: What will go poorly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018D\">CLIENT: That I wouldn\u2019t study math every day and do the math every day. That\u2019s what I figure, that I won\u2019t do that. That I\u2019ll fail to do that and I\u2019ll won\u2019t pass the course with a C and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Is there some reason why you won\u2019t do it do you think? What is it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20191\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, purposely. Well the reason why I smoke weed all the time though that\u2019s just an excuse. I would not be doing it regardless. This is not a time to change horses so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20193\">THERAPIST: There must be something about doing all the sitting down and studying is bringing out, bringing something out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20195\">CLIENT: Yes. But sometimes it\u2019s fun though. Sometimes it\u2019s fun. Like reading about stats is really interesting. This is when I think oh here\u2019s what I can do with that. I\u2019ve been working on a system for years and trying to convert all possible minis (ph) games I have into one universal systems that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201951\">can play all minis (ph) games together, by myself in solitary because that\u2019s what I do with games anyway. So they\u2019re fun video days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20197\">And I realize now I can actually have the tools. I never could do that before because I could never make it work; I could never figure out the math. And now I say oh wait, I know the math. Oh shit, I can make any of these normal distributions and I can make them all Z scores and then boom. Yes, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201971\">I got everything I need.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563469\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yes, you just need, I mean I\u2019m just going to keep saying this, but you just need the face time with it. That\u2019s all you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2019B\">CLIENT: I think you\u2019re right. That\u2019s why I \u2018m so excited about the idea of calculus, doing that. I\u2019d love to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yes? You just need time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yes. More math. It\u2019d be fun to go get a bachelor\u2019s in math. Really, that\u2019d be cool. I could transfer those other credits [inaudible at 00:50:05] naturals in math. It would be a really good math fortunately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A3\">CLIENT: I guess that\u2019s the thing I interpret (ph). Oh but Ginny said this, we should bring out some batons (ph) just in your head so we can talk about it next time. Ginny said that I often view what I should view as my normal self-esteem as grandiosity and manic insanity. Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Wait, what did she mean by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A7\">CLIENT: Well, I was feeling a little down on myself for a few days. I said you know I\u2019m feeling good about myself. I\u2019m a little worried that\u2019s just my mania. She said when you do that, when you have normal self-esteem about yourself you\u2019re worried you\u2019re screaming crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s a really good point, and yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201AB\">CLIENT: She said I haven\u2019t noticed you doing any of those things. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Yes, no, you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201AF\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s good, it\u2019s good. However we haven\u2019t had sex for over a month but at the same time I just think whatever. Well, we\u2019ll talk another day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Yes, listen man it\u2019s all about getting the face time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yes, the first part is getting to the gym.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B5\">THERAPIST: [Laughing] That\u2019s right.
