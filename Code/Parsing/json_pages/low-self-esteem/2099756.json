All my classic migraine symptoms without the pain, so I don\u2019t know what was going on with that, but I went home and slept. And now I feel terribly guilty and really anxious about some of my co-workers.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I guess this constant fear that I\u2019m lazy, malingering and that I was faking being sick in order to not deal with work.

(inaudible) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I know there\u2019s a lot going on this week because it\u2019s the week before Easter. There\u2019s been other rehearsals or stuff at church every night this week and it\u2019s sort of wearing me down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">Yesterday afternoon, I woke up and got managed together enough to go to choir rehearsals. Which is good because the music we\u2019re practicing is hard and we haven\u2019t given any of our pieces enough attention. It is\u2014you know friends of mine who sang in community choirs, and have to learn three pieces over <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">the course of a season; talk about, \u201cOh my Goodness, three pieces, this is so much.\u201d And we learn at least a piece a week, if not more. Which is it\u2019s just we don\u2019t perform as well as community choirs who have a whole season to learn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">It\u2019s just a little a little break neck sometimes, but made it to practice and practice pieces. And on one of them I\u2019m actually is singing with the altos instead of with the sopranos. Because I can\u2019t hit the high the high A and the hallelujah chorus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">But a bunch of my friends who sit in the altos section are like, \u201cOf course you can hit a high A.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201c No, I really can\u2019t.\u201d and they were like, \u201cYes you can, you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about yourself.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve practiced this piece with my voice instructor and she says I can\u2019t hit it yet.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">It really I was just it was really frustrating because I know they thought they we\u2019re trying to be helpful. And they know I have issues with self-confidence and self-image, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099756\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: I see, in this case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: In this case it really is a fact, but I can\u2019t reliability hit that note with any kind of clarity or relevance or I can shriek it, but it doesn\u2019t sound good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m going to trust my voice instructor on that, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(Pause from [0:08:36.8] to [0:08:59.3])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I accidently ended up over-scheduling myself for Saturday. I registered for this workshop that runs from one to five. Forgetting that Easter is the next day and I should reserve time for preparing Easter dinner. And I have a friend who will always hold her Passovers Sader late around Saturday, regardless <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">when Passover actually starts. Just because it\u2019s more convenient for her and her family. And that would be this Saturday and that\u2019s gonna take out my whole evening. And then a member of my congregation died on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Oh gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t know her. She was very old and has been in a nursing home for the last 12 years, but she\u2019d been part of the congregation for her entire life. 90 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Wow, that\u2019s cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, the choir is going to sing at her funeral. And our choir director says this is not mandatory, you might have other plans, but I kind of feel obligated to go. Between that and the workshop and the theatre, that\u2019s my entire Saturday and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to prepare for Easter and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">(inaudible 0:10:26.9) how much running from event to event I\u2019m going to ended up doing, is the thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(Pause from [0:10:33.5] to [0:11:09.6])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your like, it must be exhausting.

I think it\u2019s more I\u2019m really worried that because my schedule is so overfull all week, this weekend. And going through the weekend that I\u2019ll just end up flaking out on commitments. Not showing up or not doing things or doing a poor job. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I also kind of hate the fact that I have a huge need for downtime between events and things and my mind, it\u2019s a capital T, everything I need to do after work. And the more things there are, the harder it gets. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just friends with a bunch of superwoman. But a lot of my friends manage <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">to pack more things into their day than I do. I feel a little bit self-conscious about how much relaxation time I need to stay functional. And part of me worries that maybe I don\u2019t actually need so much downtime, I\u2019m just being lazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(Pause from [0:12:34.2] to [0:13:09.20])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: You said I guess part of which for me is the sense that (Pause) you probably question the \u201cT\u201d times through today, right? The most recent one is you know Why am I not doing as much as my friends are doing? Sort of like that. Is it because I\u2019m lazy or because they are superwoman. What <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">the hell is going on here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: And (Pause) you\u2019re really not sure, how often you do you pretend to, I realize you are kind of weighing on the side of laziness. (Pause) Another part is and I think it\u2019s important, which I think I\u2019m addressing the role of like other people in this. Who it seems like sometimes you want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">sort of reassure you, but maybe not really. Or like in the choir, who were clearly being nice and trying to reassure you, but just were also wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099756\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019m trying to think what\u2019s important to me like A part of this is you actually wanting to know what\u2019s really going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: That I\u2019m not talking about the emotional part of, are you lazy, read bad or are they superwoman reading it\u2019s ok and maybe it\u2019s even cool that their superwoman. Which would be sort of better or at the least a relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: And an important part of the thing is, you want to know. And it\u2019s nice that your friends are being reassuring, but they\u2019re not really saying. The one main thing is actually, you being in command of the facts and the reality of what they are. And maybe that has something to do with why reassurance <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">isn\u2019t necessarily helpful. Because in a way, even though it\u2019s nice to be nicely treated, and certainly beats the shit out of being badly treated. (Laughing) It\u2019s still not the same as you actually knowing how it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Right. I just have so much trouble trusting my own feelings, memories, and judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: And other peoples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Why do you say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Because, I think you just don\u2019t see the content of the experience of someone being reassuring as maybe their partly being informative, but mostly their just being nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(Pause from [0:16:51.1] to [0:18:00.5])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Part of this is, every single one of these situations are today, often other times sort of involves the question of, I think in your mind, whether you\u2019re fucking up in some major way. That reflects on you as a bad person. I wouldn\u2019t say badly, considerably badly, but that question is always <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">up for grabs. And you find it lots of places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">(Pause from [0:18:42.0] to [0:19:21.3])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: And (Pause) I bet it\u2019s the intense anxiety you experienced in relation to that question. That makes it hard for you to actually put your thoughts together. About what\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I believe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (Pause) I can\u2019t quite word this, well, you\u2019ll be condemned at the pits of hell if you get this wrong, but you feel like chocolate or vanilla. What do you feel like? (Laughs) It\u2019s like, how do you just not get so freaked out about winding up in hell. That you know it\u2019s very hard to get in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">touch with what you\u2019ve gone through.

I found this cute guy on OkCupid again and I read this profile that looked really interesting to me. And the person seemed really smart <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">and funny and awesome and then I got to the bottom of his profile and realized, \u201cWait a second, I know this guy.\u201d He used to be roommates with my bad ex-boyfriend. And he has dated friends of mine and our social circles vaguely overlap, but I kind of, haven\u2019t seen him in five years, so that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And his first name was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Thomas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Thomas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And I imagine often growing up, the answer was clear and you were often bad, but, in a way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">happily you\u2019re not so sure about that anymore. At least often times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">But (Pause) fact that can make it difficult to locate this. And yeah, I guess this sort of anxiety around the crease not being in its proper place, it really gets to me. It should go where it\u2019s supposed to go. It should have a very clear place. Yeah, you don\u2019t have a very clear place either.

And I begged my parents to buy me perfectly square origami paper. And they were like, \u201cThat is such a waste of money, just cut a square out of your notebook paper.\u201d And I was like, \u201cIt won\u2019t be perfectly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">square because I can\u2019t cut a perfect line.\u201d and it was very, very upsetting to me. So my mom cut out some of sheets of square paper for me from my notebook and they weren\u2019t perfectly square and it drove me crazy because the shapes I folded were not perfectly symmetrical because the paper wasn\u2019t square. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB2\">It was enormously upsetting to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) Yeah, that makes it come out a little differently.

It\u2019s a Christianized, westernized version of the Sader. Which if you kind of squint you can see the origins, but it\u2019s quite Christianized, westernized in any regards, but anyway, I really like shape <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">note music. I love, love, love it and it never occurred to me that there were groups in the area that do nothing but shape music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Ok. What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: (Laughs) It\u2019s a type of folk singing that originated in England in the I want to say 17th century, but I might be wrong. It might be as recent as the 18th century. But anyway, a lot of the first wave of pilgrims and puritans who came into the US and brought that music with them and it\u2019s a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">very egalitarian style of singing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">There\u2019s no choir director, each member of the group takes turns leading different pieces. And then the name shaped note comes from the fact that instead of regular music notation, where all the notes are round. And they are filled in or not. And have a stem or not, depending on what their measureable <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">value is. The notes are literally shapes, different pictures are drawn in different shapes. A triangle might represent an \u201cA\u201d and square might represent a \u201cB\u201d and so on. [0:31:59.0]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">And so a lot of the music the different parts are all meant to try to drown out the other parts and their not very harmonic at all. They\u2019re\u2014it\u2019s quite cacophonous at times, but it\u2019s a lot of fun. And almost all shape music is Christian in theme, explicitly Christian because it was the music of puritans, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">but my choir director absolutely hates the sound of shape note music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: We sing maybe one piece a year, if that. Like some years we don\u2019t have any. We only sing that because some members become angry and demand it because they grew up with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: But it never occurred to me that there are groups in the area that meet every week to do nothing but shape note music. And I think this is fantastic. But I\u2019m also really worried about showing up because Thomas invited me. And what if things end up really awkward when we meet each other. Is this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">a date, is this not a date, meeting friend. I don\u2019t know. I feel overwhelmed by anxieties of all of the things that could possibly go wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">(Pause from [0:33:06.7] to [0:33:45.8])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: And then there\u2019s also part of it, where, in one of his responses to me, Thomas said that he would literally did not recognize who I was from my OkCupid profile. He was like, \u201cYou have changed so much since we\u2019ve last spent any time at all hanging out together.\u201d And I mean, in some regards I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E51\">knew this. And on some regards I deliberately set out to change who I am and becoming a different person than I was ten years ago. I don\u2019t really like the me of ten years ago very much. Having changed for the better well, I assume that I\u2019ve changed for the better.

It made me very uncomfortable to hear someone else say it. I felt a little bit embarrassed someone would point it out that you know, like someone had pointed out that I had stepped in a pile of dog shit and it was stuck on my shoe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: You know why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: No I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">(Pause from [0:35:20.1] to [0:35:33.7])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Do you think it\u2019s because (Pause) maybe he remembered what you like?
