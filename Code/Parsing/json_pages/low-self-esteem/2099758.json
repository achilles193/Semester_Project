(Laughs) So I turned <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">around, came back, and got stuck behind a school bus.

Do you want me to write you checks ever so often or?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I'm ok with just holding on to it and crediting it towards next year's deductible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Sure, that would be ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I've been trying to keep track of an extra what is it, 30 bucks a month or whatever, it would drive me nuts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Sure. You need a pen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes I do. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, I have all this so it's easy for me to track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, you have billing software and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Exactly. It's got to make you think it's much easier than it should, but it does make them much easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Hopefully more reliable than a restaurant. I have a new checkbook and I can't tell if the top check is an actual check or it should work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Okay. (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: So I noticed in a pattern, in the last couple of weeks of all things that I want to bring here and talk about, like the day before, the morning of, while I'm getting ready, but then I'll come in here and I'll just be silent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">I'll either have forgotten about the things that I meant to bring up or I'll feel like they are silly or there's this particular failure mode that I have a lot with my (inaudible), you look up stuff you want to talk about and I'll start. And then it's just too overwhelming to put it all in to words <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">and I'll get really tired and just not want to face it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">Or sometimes I'll feel that there's too much backstory and that it would take too long to bring you up to speed with everything. It's all very and the thing that I want to talk about today falls into that category of, \"Oh my God there's 12 years of backstory here, how can I possibly sum it up?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">Sorry, there's kind of a lot of moving parts and everything's complicated. I don't know where to start. Suggestions for how to organize my thoughts? I know that might be kind of asinine because I never told you what my thoughts are. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Let's see. Well. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">Yeah I think you're probably worried about talking about it or uncomfortable to talk about it and we can have a mini conversation about the best way to arrange your thoughts, but I think that would probably in this case, probably be avoiding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Sure and I don't want to have a long conversation, which is something new. I was just hoping things that you have observed that have helped other people actually start talking. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Matter of fact, if I tell you is pretty asinine, which start talking, don't worry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099758\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Ok well, I'll just start with approximate causes and work backwards from there, instead of trying to start from the beginning, chronological working forward. So, I was online, browsing around and I ran across a profile of someone who used to be apartment-mates with my bad ex-boyfriend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: His name is Ashley. I think I mentioned him last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: We started messaging and we're going to see each other on Saturday. And we kind of had this stupidly long processingly e-mail conversation about whether this was or was not a date and what is the definition of date and we're both ridiculously wordy human beings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Literally thousands of words spilled on the topic of, Is this a date or is it not and if it is, is it a good idea. Oh my goodness it was, but anyways. So, I knew this guy 12 years ago when I was a very different person and I don't particularly like the person I was then, so I'm kind of Part <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">of me is wandering what the hell I was thinking when I messaged him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">It was very much an impulse decision, but I did not think through. And in hindsight, why did I think this was going to be a good idea? He's very attractive, he's predominantly pretty. Aesthetically, he hits a bunch of my buttons. He's also very smart and very funny and his online demeanor We've been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">live journal friends, are you familiar with live journal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Ok, so Live Journal is a blogging service that was invented in 1999, 2000ish, I've been on it since the beginning. And so has Ashley and so has a bunch of my friends in the university, hang around gate community and it's the way my friends and I use it, I don't want to be prescriptive about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">the way everyone uses it or be descriptive because I don't how to answer it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">The way my friends and I use it is very much about emotional processing and venting and the things you can't say in polite company, but you can go and put on your live journal under a filter, like password protected, only certain people can read it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">So, I have written a lot about my parents and processing all of the fallout from the way I was raised. I've written about relationships going bad. I've written a lot of stuff that makes me angry and I also write, used to write, not much anymore because I just don't have time for it. I used to write <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">a lot about race and gender and politics and intersections thereof and how very angry it all made me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">But there's couple of pieces I want to talk about later and going back to Ashley, we've been live journal friends for 12 years and then I stopped using live journal awhile ago.  Although, he still has me friended on his journal. And after I messaged him, I went and read the last three years entries, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">which not all that many because he doesn't post that much, but anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I'm just going to shut this a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Sure. So it's not in your eyes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: But anyways, so where I was going with all of this was, even though I haven't really seen him since Phil and I broke up. I feel like I know him because we've been reading each other's journals for so long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">And so he's tremendously smart and funny and I never really thought of him as someone I could potentially date until I saw his profile online. And I don't know, I'm now second guessing my decision to try to connect with him because there's many of people in this world who are attracted to me and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">is opening up an enormous can of worms for me. With confronting who I was ten years ago. And how did I get from there to here. It's stirring up a lot of old memories that I would have preferred not to have stirred up. I don't know. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099758\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Well, I imagine the worries are the same all around with you and with him and with me. That (Pause) will, in you looking at, thinking about who you were or at least how you imagine now how you were then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: That will project you to fall. (Pause) And that one way you try to manage that worry is through, sort of, considerations about how to look at yourself with structured things. Whether it's talking to me or how your definition or his definition (inaudible) a date coincided. (Laughter) Get out <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">your head and think about things. There's nothing wrong with reassuring yourself and I'm not trying to say that's bad. I'm just saying I think it's a bit trying to reassure yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: You're scared about putting out there more plainly thinks I think about who you were. You know, you alluded to, seemingly different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">(Pause from  to ) What's on your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I don't know. I'm, just still trying to figure out why I got in touch with Ashley and if it's going to be a good idea. My motivations aren't really okay with me and it's a little unsettling. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: I think he's a hottie. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Not in the mainstream conventional sense of the word, but for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: To you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: There's a lot of hot people in the world, there's a lot of hot people online and there's lot's hot people who are friends of friends who set me up on dates with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">I guess one story I can tell and I don't know how true any of these stories I'm about to tell are. But one story I could tell is because I used to know him. And I know something about him and he knows a bunch of my friends. And we have our social circles overlap and we have friends in common. That lowers <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">the risk versus complete stranger online. I know he's not going to be a complete nutcase, he's not going to be horribly offensive to me, and you know. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: And you like him, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes, I do and I like him!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I trust you that you're attracted to him, well, there's that too. But I get the impression from the way you talk about him that you really like him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yes.  As much as you can like someone where your only attractions in the last eight years have been on the Internet. I don't know. Another story I could tell is that there's something pathological that I'm trying to relive my college years by dating all the people I wanted to date back then. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">But didn't because I was too crazy and too repressed then. All those horrible adjectives to describe the me, 12 years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: And how is that pathological exactly? (Pause) I understand why you might want to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I mean because time passes and try to go back and recreate the situation that has already passed, that kind of feels a little bit to me like willfully trying to ignore or deny reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099758\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: That would make a lot of sense, if that was what you we're trying to do. But as far as I can tell, you don't anything to do with the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: The more I keep reconnecting with people who I know from my past. (Laughter) Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Sorry about that. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: What I can remember ever wanting to be in a relationship with him then. Just appreciation of how hot he is. But I think when I knew him as Phil's roommate; he was terribly intimidating to me. I was 19, he is six years older than me, which is nothing at 30, but it's quite a big deal at 19. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: What's attractive about him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: His sense of humor is just ever so lightly skewed from the mainstream, instead of he's just I don't know, the phrase aggressively weird is coming to me. And I think this is, that it's not quite fair, I think there too many connotations we hang on the word aggressive for that to be to really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">get across what I mean. But he's very un-self-consciously weird. And he's very enthusiastic about just about everything. He's one of those people who Carpe' Diem and break his leg. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">Completely unsurprisingly by now, physically, he's pretty anti-feminine. Tall and wiry and all that. Usually gets my attention. (Pause) He's smarter than me, but didn't study the same things I studied. I like spending time with people that are smarter than me, they're fascinating, wonderful people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">but sometimes that pushes a bunch of my insecurity buttons and Ashley doesn't do that because, which is entirely different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: What does he do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: He studies linguistics. And did natural language processing software development for a while. And then he went to law school and now he does patent law. Which is a little questionable as a career choice as far as I'm concerned. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Because it is, pay for a patent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yes. We have some ideology mismatch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">(Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">Yeah we're meeting on Saturday to make barbeque because he is quite possibly the only other person in the area who won't turn up his nose at mustard based barbeque. His folks are from the South. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">There's more history, I don't know, there's always more history. I think I can keep talking about history for hours and not get to all of it. But he dated until 2009, a woman named Katie, with whom I have had a very contentious relationship ever since Katie and I have known each other. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">We met as freshman at school at a bar and Katie and I and just instant oil and water. We rubbed each other the wrong way from day one. Katie has, what I refer to, and tell me if this phrase doesn't make sense, a cultive personality around her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: It guess, sort of get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, all these hangers on and groupies, who just want to be Katie because she's kind of social nexus and I always resented that always, always. And I mean, the resentment, I fully own that's my problem, not hers. I need to get over that. I have to some extent recently, but I really don't enjoy <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">being around her and watching people hanging on her every word while she's you know, spiraling around in her little vortex of angst and drama.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) (Pause from  to ) You seem convinced that you're doing something wrong here.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099758\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yes I do. Seem convinced that is. Possibly because I am. Possibly because I am confused. I don't know, I mentioned to a friend of mine, Lori, who I've also known since our freshman year up at school. And Lori and Katie have been best friends since freshman. They're really close and I'm really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">close to Lori and it's terribly frustrating to Lori that Katie and I never got along.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Anyway, for Lori's sake, Katie and I reached a detente a couple of years ago. Just try to stay out of each other's way now, but anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">And so I was talking to Lori and told her I had a date with Ashley and she said, \"Well, that's an interesting choice.\" and I was like, \"Why?\" and I was like, \"Is there something I should know, was there massive drama between him and Katie, like is there?\" And she was like and she pointed out that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">I just seem to be dating or you know just sleeping with a lot of people we used to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">Why I'm not meeting new people, instead of going back to the old fishing hole. I'm totally not a whore. (Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">I also feel like, I think that it's just a factor of the particular social groups that I'm in. But it almost feels like there's something gauche about looking for people to date via dating websites. And it's shameful and you should form relationships with people you know. They should evolve organically <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">out of your social circles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">It might just be the way geeks, as a generalization, were traumatized by mainstream rules for dating and relationships in high school and have decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater. That wouldn't surprise me at all, if that's what's going on. (Chuckle) But I don't know, I feel a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">judged by, not all my friends for things like going online for the purpose of finding someone to go on a date with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) threw off by social (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">(Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: There's a faint desperation about it. (Pause) It can't be that terrible because I have come across many people who I know in real life online. And instantly blocked them because bad idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">But I think, it might be that people are posturing one thing and their all in the position I'm in, anybody in my immediate social circle, who I was going to date, I've already dated. And I decided it's a bad idea, so now I have to look outside my offline social networks. But I don't know it's a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">I can't tell if people are actually judging or if I'm just projecting my own insecurities, but I feel judged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">(Pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah I guess it makes me think of you, sort of you creating a situation, of almost like at work. Where you wind up feeling like the people you are connected to and in a way are watching over you. By thinking all these bad things. I think I can see how unproductive and pathological you are. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">And really, the reason you set things up that way. You know what I mean, you getting, you sort of arrange it so that\u2014I don't think it's the whole reason. But it feels like a fishbowl in a way. With people kind of doing. There's nothing wrong with you and there needs to be something, probably but clearly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C92\">you know, painful and difficult. But maybe also reassuring about things that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099758\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: What do you mean?
