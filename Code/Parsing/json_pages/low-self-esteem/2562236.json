You know, then were kind of happy to shut that down and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">focus on work. Which I guess is feeling easier to do\u2014like, you know, in the last few days than it often has. And, you know, especially wanting to think more about that kind of stuff like with Paul. Now either you are really tired and I guess a bit worn out and kind of just as soon not.

It feels like something of a withdrawal from me which feels (pause 00:11:29 00:11:33) safer in a way. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">But I think also a\u2014it leaves you missing something.

I should be doing something else or kind of doing something else at work. (pause 00:13:06 00:13:11) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">But I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of\u2014I don\u2019t know. I already feel like I\u2019m kind of at my limit or kind of\u2014I don\u2019t know. (pause 00:13:18 00:13:22) And I don\u2019t know. (pause 00:13:24 00:13:35) Yeah. I mean I guess it\u2019s just like more things to do or kind of like pushing (inaudible). (pause 00:13:40 00:13:46) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:13:46 00:13:52) When you say it seems like more things to do (inaudible) to do things, you\u2019re referring to reaching out more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:14:01 00:14:53) Yeah. I have a sense that (pause 00:14:55 00:14:59) maybe there\u2019s this sort of translation that you\u2019re doing where it\u2019s actually that you\u2019re wanting to be closer to people. But somehow that gets translated into another obligation. I mean I know it\u2019s not easy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">Like I\u2019m not\u2014that\u2019s not a translation that it\u2019s the way it is. I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s risky and it\u2019s hard and can lead to upset, difficulty. But I guess what I\u2019m saying is (pause 00:15:28 00:15:32) I think you feel it (pause 00:15:34 00:15:38) perhaps kind of anxiety about wanting to be closer <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">to people per se. And so, you sort of package it for yourself more as like a task or something you should do. (pause 00:15:51 00:15:56) And maybe this sort of vaguely comes from outside in part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: (pause 00:15:59 00:16:15) Right. And I just feel like I should be doing something else. I don\u2019t know. For I don\u2019t know. Enjoyment or something. But everything kind of comes down to me making myself do something rather than pushing myself. Nothing comes because I want to do it. Or, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">natural. (pause 00:16:35 00:17:05) Or it\u2019s kind of like everything is kind of disappointing. Or I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not reliable or kind of (pause 00:17:16 00:17:23)\u2014yeah. (pause 00:17:23 00:17:40) I don\u2019t know. I guess I just feel very\u2014I don\u2019t know. Boring.

Like (inaudible) maybe like coin a phrase which is like to pull a Paul (ph) on somebody which means like to kind of not be there anymore. Not be <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">available.

Or to me in that like we want to gossip and chit chat and sort of get absorbed drama. (pause 00:32:24 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">00:32:30) And (pause 00:32:30 00:32:40) it seems so frivolous, I think, to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: (pause 00:32:47 00:32:55) I think it just affects me more.
