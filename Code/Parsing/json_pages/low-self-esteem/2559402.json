(Heavy breathing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(Pause): [00:00:20 00:00:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I've been holed up in the apartment with a cold. So I'm not very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(Pause): [00:00:40 00:00:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Dean and I had a huge kind of fight last night. I don't know whether it's because of being holed up or what, but I think it's kind of some of that and my behavior probably related to what we talked about last time like the whole day that Chris (sp?) and I have fallen into. But I guess we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">talking about not having friends or whatever and he said, 'you're a loser. You see everything in terms of punishment or like we don't get invited therefore people must not like us. So, I was like, well it's hard for me not to think that way. Then I kind of remembered a couple of friends who I was close <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">with and I'm not anymore and like these kinds deliberately went online and deleted me as their friend and one of them was amidst friends, that person was gay and I think we talked about it and like he's Chris's (sp?) friend and so he wanted to show his loyalty to Chris (sp?) but I felt betrayed because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">I'd really reached out to him when he came out but he spent all this time like reading about musicians and I read a few novels and I bought him a novel and he and I used to hang out and he was like don't you even want to hear my side of the story? So I felt very sad about that and (unclear) is like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B4\">'why is this not broken?' He says of (unclear), 'who that guy? He's just collateral damage and that was bound to happen.' And I've lost a friend, too, and was talking about (unclear). And I said, 'why are you and I still' I felt like just (unclear), 'why is not broken?' I don't want to be known as <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B5\">a cheater, if that is going to be the narrative, you know. He's like I don't think of you that way and I think like for most people this breaks the relationship because they can't get past this and they only see the relationship in those terms. They just cannot get this one thing aside. But I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B6\">of all the other things they're doing to our company. I want to be with you. All those things in there and we want to get past that thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I mean just say that I think that they were nice and he got upset for some reason, I don't know what. And I just kind of shut up. I couldn't open up to him like I don't know, like I was saying, 'are you very upset?' And Dean was like I'm going to answer about your (unclear) insecurities. So I thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">he was mad so I couldn't open up to him and then when he kind of calmed down he was like, you know, it's okay, it doesn't mean that you know couples fight and this and that and my reaction was I'm going to go back to my apartment and something and then I just go and he's like, 'why does that have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">to be the case? You know, people fight. You get angry at me all the time, but that doesn't mean you hate me, right?' And I was like, 'when you get mad at me that's what I think, you know that you hate me.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And then I was thinking about this the whole night and I think one time you got a little upset and like for the rest of the session I couldn't talk at all, like I was like in tears, or something. (Laughs). So just like the same thing I guess happens when I get so afraid when I think that I've made someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">mad that I just I cannot open up to them for like a few hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559402\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: When was I upset with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: This is like a while back. Like this was like a small misunderstanding. I don't know, I couldn't make some time or something. I was commuting -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: We talked about scheduling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah and you said like, 'it seems that you had all this time available.' And I just was like, 'oh no, I didn't mean that at all.' And (unclear) that you came across as a little upset so I think I started crying or something. (Laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">And like the last couple of sessions, I'm just saying like that happens to me like people who I look up to and they like in the case of Chris, I really look up to like I just cannot and he kept saying, 'tell me what you're thinking, tell me what you're thinking.' And I just couldn't. And I just felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">so weird and then I was thinking maybe he and I just don't share that kind of relationship. I think of him as he just has great intelligence, a smart person who is going to achieve so much. That's who he is as his whole entity and then when he and I are together we are having great conversations and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">he's encouraging me, he's teaching me, he's keeping me accountable. He's giving me structure and we are cooking together and making his place look more beautiful and yeah, well that's it, you know. Like I just cannot share my emotions with him just because I just don't know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: How did you feel you made him angry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you were analogizing it to feeling like I was upset with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I wasn't clear of the analogy when you were saying that \"it's hard for me,\" you were referencing the time that you felt that I was upset with you and I didn't get the connection to Chris.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I was just saying that like I couldn't talk for the rest of the session. I was scared. So that's the similarity that I was saying. I was scared with Chris also so like I just couldn't talk to him. And he kept asking me to open up to him to tell him what I was thinking. So I was just wondering <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">like why I couldn't. (Laughs) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: What do you think you're scared of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Several things a couple of things. Well one thing is that I was (unclear) and I cannot keep talking (unclear). He's already specifically said that I already talk too much. I try not to but even the little that I do is, obviously, too much for him. (Laughs) So I couldn't tell him about that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">And then -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What did you want to say about (unclear) to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Like he's saying, 'what are you thinking?' So like if he wants to know exactly what I'm thinking then that' not (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I cannot change that at all. Chris I mean, I'm scared of making him even more mad or (unclear) his judgment that, 'you're stupid,' or 'you're nothing.' And, 'you're just wasting my time and your time, get out.' And I know he's not going to say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(Pause): [00:10:31 00:10:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: But I don't know, like I kept thinking that he was a liar, I think, I mean, yeah. Maybe that's why I don't want to open up to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">(Pause): [00:11:11 00:11:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I don't know.

(Laugh) I mean he's so productive and like he has a set time for everything and even while he's not working he said he's going to take this week off. Even on his week off he's been working on some website on which he's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">been posting articles and stuff. (Laughs). Even the non-work is even work and I had school all this week. I mean I don't get anything done and like him watching me waste time also makes me feel very conscious of that but it's like it's worse than being naked or something that he can really see me as <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">someone disgusting and someone that just wastes so much time and I just feel horrible. You know, like I want to be someone sparkly and productive and efficient sitting across the dinner table and (unclear) and having a lot to say for myself. But I don't and I'm messy and I'm a mess. Like how can anyone <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200653\">love this?

It's like my mind just keeps going there and just keeps thinking, none of this was there with him. Like, I think. Maybe I was just so happy that I wasn't focusing on anything major. But I wasn't, yeah I wasn't loathing myself. I didn't think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">of myself as anything less. Yeah, I even felt myself as equal to him for some weird reason, you know. Like I didn't care if we were wasting time or whatever and everything was important, too, and it didn't matter like, 'oh, it's way past dinnertime,' or, 'it's way past lunchtime,' or something it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">didn't really, it was whatever time we ate or (unclear) worked and didn't seem wrong, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">(Pause): [00:21:34 00:21:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: But maybe I shouldn't think of that situation at all.

When I'm not thinking about it I mean you know, we are able to have a good time. But I think it's always there in the back of my head, this inequality.
