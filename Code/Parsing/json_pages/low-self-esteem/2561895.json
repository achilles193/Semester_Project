I really haven\u2019t been able to do the whole getting a regular bedtime and waking up at a regular hour thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Challenging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think left to my own devices I would be able to do it, but Sydney always wants to stay up late or [inaudible] we try to get to bed at a reasonable hour and then I\u2019ve been setting alarms and then resetting them and sleeping in. Even though I would\u2019ve already had eight hours sleep or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">like that, just still being lethargic. And I really don\u2019t know what to do to fix it. The problem is if he\u2019s using his computer, even if I have a sleep mask on, it\u2026 the light gets in underneath it and it makes it really hard for me to fall asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: And he often uses his computer in bed? [1:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, when he\u2019s not able to fall asleep, then trying to calm down and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it seems like part of this is your sleep pattern but also part of this is really a couple\u2019s issue because it\u2019s about really how you guys manage together the sleep patterns and respect for one another\u2019s goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: And sometimes he\u2019s like well, he could go to the kitchen to use the computer and sometimes he isn\u2019t. I guess when we\u2019ve gotten into a fight about going to sleep was when he would\u2026 then he\u2019s already so upset that he doesn\u2019t want to get up at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Well how important is this to you? I mean I know it\u2019s something we talked about and I kind of highlighted as something that might be useful, but is it something that\u2019s important to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s sort of\u2026 I guess it\u2019s not as important right now. Once I start volunteering, if I start volunteering, which I\u2019m not sure will happen because there\u2019s some administrative loopholes that my supervisor would have to go through. And so she submitted the form but hasn\u2019t heard back from <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">them yet. So once I start volunteering I mean then I guess one day a week I would, unless I do more days, but I think it would be one day a week, so one day a week I\u2019d have to go to bed at a normal hour and wake up on time. But even then I probably\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s not a schedule. [2:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not a schedule. That\u2019s one day. So\u2026 and then I think once I do get a job it\u2019ll be easier to justify it. I mean he would go to sleep on\u2026 at ten on the days that I had to go to bed at ten. It\u2019s just that right now there\u2019s not something pressing; it\u2019s just this abstract oh we should get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">up. The thing, though, is that he actually does well and he really likes mornings. But it\u2019s hard to get him to sleep in time such that he could actually enjoy the morning. And just then when we get up and it\u2019s 11:00 or 12:00 I already feel like half the day\u2019s wasted, and then it\u2019s not\u2026 we\u2019re not getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">breakfast we\u2019re getting lunch already. And so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So it does sound like, just from what you just said, you feel like half the day\u2019s wasted. So you sound frustrated with the idea that you would be sleeping in that late as a couple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, even though a lot of it\u2019s my fault because I could wake up earlier, I just don\u2019t always have that willpower. Like today I was able to just fine, but I don\u2019t know, other days I haven\u2019t been able to.

And you know that I think a consistent sleep pattern would be helpful in those things, but I am not going to push my agenda on you. The therapy agenda is your agenda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: But I\u2026 yeah, I haven\u2019t written any cover letters in the past week. There\u2019s one thing I might apply to though. It\u2019s\u2026 it requires some\u2026 I have the basic experience but then there\u2019s specific subject experience that I don\u2019t have at all. Or I guess I could read up a little on it before I apply, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">I don\u2019t think that\u2026 it\u2019s not the kind of thing that I can have demonstrated experience in and so it\u2019s already a stretch. And then it\u2019s all the way out in Providence so it wouldn\u2019t start until June, and it\u2019s a longshot anyways. And then there was this other one in Concord that you have to fill out the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">application, and it seems like a bunch of hoops to hump through. And I mean it doesn\u2019t help that my printer isn\u2019t\u2026 well it\u2019s not broken it\u2019s just that the printer cord is in one of the boxes that I haven\u2019t unpacked yet. So currently unavailable printer, annoying application, for a thing that\u2026 if it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">were a permanent job I wouldn\u2019t hesitate at all, but this one is... I guess they have 60 feet of records and they are budgeting 10 to 11 hours per foot, so a total of 600 or 660 hours which I divided it with the 600 and that\u2019s 15 weeks. So it\u2019s for a relatively short period of time and I\u2019m like is it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F4\">really worth it to do this for this. I mean I probably should anyways even if it isn\u2019t going to be permanent but\u2026 and I\u2019m just also afraid this will make me look even more like a job hopper than I already am, even though\u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well you\u2026 you\u2019re not leaving permanent positions. I think if your resume shows that you\u2019re completing projects that you were hired for, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re leaving companies or leaving zoos in the middle of a contract position. So I think that might\u2026 I\u2019m not sure that taking time limited <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">projects makes you look like a job hopper. It could also\u2026 part of a cover letter is about spinning what you see and telling the story that someone\u2019s going to see on your resume. And I think the story you can tell if you have a couple of time limited jobs is that you\u2019ve taken advantage of opportunities <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">to expand your skills. You have sought out temporary work in between positions. I think there are good ways to sell that story. [7:35] Is it something\u2026 is it a project that seems in your skill set, interesting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Mostly it\u2019s some old church stuff. And I\u2019ve done lots of old church records before but I guess the one thing is it talks about having experience processing a large collection, which I don\u2019t have. And so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: But it would be probably nice to gain if you could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, but they want it already, is what I\u2019m saying, and so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a hard requirement or if I meet all the other requirements it would okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Right, if having\u2026 I mean it seems like a nice blending of your two degrees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it does.

I totally forgot about the whole divinity school thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean that kind of might stand out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even have enough room to put all my degrees on there because they give you\u2026 they want high school and up and so they give you three slots.

That\u2026 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: If you went to college and have two masters degrees, the high school\u2026 I would\u2026 if you have three spots for education, I\u2019d put your three highest degrees, and most related degrees.

I think they put that there for people that haven\u2019t completely beyond high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Okay, yeah, I guess it\u2019s a standard form that just has the position typed in and everything else is\u2026 yeah because it has things\u2026 not even\u2026 it has typing words per minute and writing words per minute. I\u2019m like okay, I\u2019m going to read\u2026 leave writing words per minute blank because I don\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">know how to test that, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant to my job at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: No. So yeah, I mean I think if it\u2019s a standard form then that high school spot is for people that that\u2019s their highest completion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean I\u2019m also having trouble with the Providence one is because you\u2019re\u2026 it\u2019s one of those apply online things, and you have to create an account and it keeps on\u2026 I haven\u2019t gone beyond updating the account.

I know that neither one seems perfect but they seem like they could be potentially good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: [inaudible] better at writing cover letters. And I found out a few days ago that I didn\u2019t get one of the Yale positions I applied to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It\u2019s okay. I mean it wasn\u2019t my greatest cover letter ever so\u2026 and it was one of the ones that I was like wasn\u2019t sure if I was possibly overqualified.

It just sort of had one paragraph of a\u2026 well it had the intro paragraph. I had the paragraph about what my relevant experience was.

And I guess they don\u2019t sound that passionate and maybe\u2026 but they\u2019re\u2026 I\u2019m just so sick of\u2026 maybe I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">should just make the boilerplate text. If I know less about the individual part of Yale then I have to write oh, I really like Yale, which it\u2019s true, and I got my masters there, and I really would like to work there, but if the same people are reading those cover letters, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m wondering <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200673\">if my interviews gone bad have blackballed me from getting a job at Yale. [13:24] Or if they don\u2019t really remember me, which is what I\u2019m hoping, and it\u2019s just because my stuff isn\u2019t strong enough. Or maybe by the time\u2026 because it\u2019d been almost three weeks since they put it up until I found it and applied, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200674\">so maybe they already had the candidates they wanted to interview or something.

So it was\u2026 I think I came off\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I came <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">off as arrogant or something when I was like oh, I guess you probably wouldn\u2019t know that. It was just in response to having the previous recruiter interview, like that phone interview that I bombed, because it took me until too late to realize oh wait, this is a recruiter who doesn\u2019t know anything about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">the [inaudible] I should\u2019ve been explaining these things. And that\u2019s why she\u2019s acting completely unimpressed by things that should actually be impressive. So I went too much in the opposite direction. I mean that one also just like could\u2019ve\u2026 the second one, the one that was in person with the zoo recruiter, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F3\">could\u2019ve also just been the fact that I didn\u2019t have the customer service experience that they wanted, even though my resume mentioned that I didn\u2019t have the customer service experience. I didn\u2019t have any customer service jobs I could put on there. [15:26] And I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m starting to get worried because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F4\">I don\u2019t want to\u2026 things are going okay with Sydney but we still fight. And so originally the plan was\u2026 we moved in together in September which would\u2026 then we could find a place that was, say, $2000 and month and then I\u2019d be paying $1000 a month rent and not almost $1400. And I don\u2019t want to make that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F5\">decision being a\u2026 based on economics, so I\u2019d really like to get a job soon so that way I\u2019m not reliant on my parents and I can justify staying in this apartment longer if I need to. I\u2019m no longer\u2026 I think\u2026 it really was the drugs that\u2026 being off the Seroquel that made me go crazy in my apartment. Now <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F6\">I\u2019m completely fine with my apartment. I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel completely fine in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: I mean I\u2019m still a little bit frustrated with the lack of hot water for washing dishes, and as such we\u2019ve been doing a lot of takeout. And today I finally did a bunch of dishes so we could eat lunch at home. But other than that I don\u2019t panic anymore when I\u2019m here. So I\u2019d be okay staying for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">another year but I don\u2019t want to be spending that much of my parent\u2019s money if I\u2019m going to not have a job. So now I\u2019m starting to feel really desperate. And I\u2019m wondering if I should go into a different field. My dad at one point, I think a few months ago, made the offer that if there was a degree <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">or training or something that I could do that would\u2026 in another field that would make me able to get a job he\u2019d pay for it. But I can\u2019t think of what\u2026 something that would be a good jumping off point that I\u2019d actually be good at that I could conceivably get a degree in, or that I\u2019d like doing. [17:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: So you want to stay in this field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: I want to stay in this field. I mean I\u2019d be okay if I found there\u2019s another field I liked. It\u2019s just that all the fields that I like are ones that don\u2019t have lots of jobs. Like if I had gotten my PhD I\u2019d be having a super hard time getting a job, too, and I would have to be probably constantly <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">moving around until I found a tenure track position and would end up somewhere where I didn\u2019t want to live because there\u2019s maybe one\u2026 if the college even has a that department maybe there\u2019d be one professor, unless we\u2019re talking about Jordan or something. So zoo science isn\u2019t as bad as academia but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">I guess just all the humanities things that I\u2019d like doing\u2026 and my mom was trying to\u2026 pushing me. The jobs that she sent me are ones like I guess they\u2019re part of\u2026 it is programming, writing educational programs for college students to participate in or something like that, and that part is fine but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200773\">then it\u2019s also\u2026 there\u2019s always this other part of trying to reach out to people. And especially\u2026 I guess this one was like Birthright trips to Jordan, and so trying to get kids to apply to Birthright and stuff, which requires being outgoing. And they even said in the entry one of the requirements was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200774\">outgoing. [19:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t feel like that fits you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: I am not outgoing. I am not outgoing.

Or if it were at a Jewish school or something, like an elementary middle school or a high school.

I don\u2019t know if some of them do require it because there\u2019s an education certificate that goes along with that. I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: Would that be worthwhile pursing? Would that count under your dad\u2019s offer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know because then I\u2019d have to do a degree, and I\u2019ve already\u2026 I mean I guess I\u2019d hope they\u2019d count all the coursework that I\u2019ve already done, but I think\u2026 I don\u2019t think it would be lucrative enough; I don\u2019t think there are enough jobs there. Those jobs are also sparse. I need something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">completely different that would\u2026 and I\u2019m wondering if I really should give up and just get an MBA and take over running the store. But I really don\u2019t want to live in Connecticut. And I probably would have\u2026 either I\u2019d live in Connecticut or I\u2019d have a horrible commute every day that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Do you want to run the store?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Not really.

[22:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, another three years, approximately, which would mean I\u2019d still have to find something to do for the next three years because\u2026 I\u2019m actually going to be helping out for a few days at the store while I\u2019m in Connecticut, doing the [inaudible]. And that will just be office stuff like cashing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">out and doing invoicing and stuff like that. That\u2019s kind of work I don\u2019t mind doing. I don\u2019t mind doing that sort of administrative assistant-y type things. The problem is, for most administrative assistant things I\u2019m over qualified. So I can\u2019t apply for those positions. Or I can apply to those positions and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: But you haven\u2019t been successful in getting them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve never been successful. Maybe if it was one at a religious institution I might have a better shot. I\u2019d have to spin it somehow that my zoo knowledge\u2026 I guess it would mean that I\u2019m really good at organizing things and that\u2019s probably a good skill to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What would that be\u2026 so would being an administrative assistant at a large temple or at a school or... would that be something that would fit for you? [24:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: I think\u2026 I mean it wouldn\u2019t be as nice as getting to work with archival collections and historic documents and stuff like that, but I mean when I was working at Planned Giving I was like\u2026 I really liked my job there. So it\u2019s something I would like\u2026 I would not mind doing. And I like having jobs <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">where I have a lot of different responsibilities, which is the opposite of what my last job was. I was just working on this one project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: So keeping in mind how you felt in different jobs, the job title might not be as important as what the skills and experience was like for you, and that it\u2019s about spinning the things you\u2019ve done and the degrees you\u2019ve earned in a way that meets those. Because there are lots of different things <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">that you know how to do that might\u2026 if you think about what skills you have rather than what degrees you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: Would I have to completely redo my resume then and do a functional one with skills or something? Because they\u2019ll see position after position after position on there. I guess I could take off the ones that happened while I was in school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You can take off some of those and put on\u2026 keep the more recent experiences.

Here are the skills that I possess. And you\u2019d want to tailor your resume if you\u2019re going to be applying to different types of things, you\u2019ll probably want to have a resume for this is one I use for these types of jobs, this is the one I use for those types <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">of jobs. It\u2019s not that you\u2019d need to reinvent it for each application but if you\u2019re going to open up an avenue of saying religious institutions administrative assistant-y type stuff, you\u2019re going to have\u2026 want a resume for that. And maybe that would start highlighting skills, your organizational skills, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B92\">your other skills, area of knowledge or expertise would be maybe something to highlight. [26:27] I do think it\u2019s important that you put down the degrees you\u2019ve earned because you\u2019ve earned some important degrees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: But that might scare them off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: But you can\u2026 I think it\u2019s\u2026 I mean I\u2019m not a career services person but it\u2019s fairly expected that they\u2019re going to be listed, right? I think\u2026 or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve been reading some more ask the manager stuff and they\u2026 sometimes it is mentioned. Oh, you can leave off a degree, you can\u2019t mislead someone about it. But if it\u2019s not relevant and it\u2019s hurting you, you can but it\u2019s like if it gives you a gap then\u2026 but I guess if I only had it going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF1\">back to a certain point, because especially if I turned it into a one page resume or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to go back to your very first job. I think five years of history is probably enough. What you did ten years ago is not that relevant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: I mean I already don\u2019t have anything from college, and I usually keep off Planned Giving unless there\u2019s\u2026 I usually use that for only administrative assistant type things.

But I\u2019m just afraid the string of positions will confuse them even if <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">I do talk in my resume about how I have all this Jewish experience and would love to work for a Jewish organization. [28:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so I wonder if you can leave that stuff\u2026 if for\u2026 if you were to have sort of like a Jewish resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean if I took off all the zoo things, though, there would be a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">THERAPIST: A big gap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">CLIENT: \u2026 a gap. So\u2026 because it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve done administrative assistant stuff and a long time since I\u2019ve\u2026 well I guess I could put the Yale [inaudible] but I stopped doing that over a year ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you\u2019d want to have what you\u2019re doing currently, most currently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, because right now I\u2019m doing nothing and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Well maybe the place to start is to open up this avenue of looking and maybe look at some of the universities around, or maybe some of the bigger organizations or temples. This is maybe the time of year where they might start to think about programming for next year. So it might be a good <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">time to look and see. This is the time of year when new memberships, Hebrew schools, that kind of stuff all gets started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

But it seems like there\u2019s an area that may not have been fully tapped that is connected to some of your interests. And in thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD1\">about what you\u2019d be happy doing on a daily basis or four days a week if you\u2019re working. I think that that is going to make a difference in how satisfied you feel with your daily life. [30:26] So it doesn\u2019t have to be either or. I mean you could certainly think about your dad\u2019s offer and if there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD2\">something you\u2019d be interested in doing, but maybe not giving up before you\u2019ve looked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t know what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so if you don\u2019t know what, what would you\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: I feel like at one point I probably thought of something, and I can\u2019t remember what it is. Like oh wait, but that would require another degree that\u2026 I already know that museum studies is out because there are no jobs, and the ones that do exist I usually try applying to anyways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Might not change the experience you\u2019re having with finding something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Unless I wanted to go into being a zookeeper, which would require a PhD, and then I\u2019d really be overqualified for everything else in the world. And I think I\u2019d be more screwed with that type of degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: More limited than you already feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2019m already feeling pretty limited. Yeah, it really frustrates me that I can\u2019t\u2026 there always are a lot of\u2026 not a lot but I very often will see listings from R.I. Public Zoo, and I can\u2019t apply to any of those. I really, really hate the residency requirements. It\u2019s the worst thing ever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">And I understand they want local people but I don\u2019t see why it would\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s really R.I. proper?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, R.I. proper. Must be a R.I. resident by the time I\u2019m starting the job. So I don\u2019t want to have to look for a new apartment and move, especially moving for a job that I live within an easy commute of. And I don\u2019t think I could get a PO\u2026 well, a PO box would work. [32:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: That might not... yeah, it doesn\u2019t complete the residence requirement that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: And they\u2019d find out with my tax documents and stuff like that, probably, where my actual address is, so I couldn\u2019t find a friend in R.I. to use as an address for applying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2026 you don\u2019t need it to apply but you need it to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, or as an address for sending it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: You would have to\u2026 if you were to apply for those jobs you would have to move if you got one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: I would have to move. So I\u2019ve never bothered because I don\u2019t feel like moving again because I\u2019ve already moved twice this year. So yeah, I just feel so trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a frustrating limitation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah it is and\u2026 because sometimes there are really good things and I\u2019m like hey, I actually have this experiment\u2026 experience. Oh, wait, it\u2019s the R.I. Public Zoo. Never mind. Yeah, and it\u2019s not like any of the other ones\u2026 like New Haven and Wallingford and any other local public zoos don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF1\">that. And the thing about R.I. is they actually do have archives and stuff where\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: None of those other zoos do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: They might have some tiny ones somewhere but it\u2019s mostly just books. So I just\u2026 I don\u2019t really know anyone who I could think of to ask about jobs at this point. My network is kind of tapped out. [33:52] I mean it was never that big to begin with. And I didn\u2019t really get in a better position <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">with\u2026 the last job happened really\u2026 the people I\u2019ve met don\u2019t have any local\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: Connections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: \u2026 connections. So it\u2019s okay, yeah, I\u2019ll have a really nice reference but I feel like I\u2019ve gained nothing other than\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Well you had a good\u2026 you had a stretch of employment and pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it wasn\u2019t that much pay so it wasn\u2019t enough to be self-sufficient on. So at this point it\u2019s just\u2026 I feel like I sort of wasted a year. I mean I guess I didn\u2019t waste a year because at least I was\u2026 it doesn\u2019t leave a gap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t leave a gap. You completed an important project. And you weren\u2019t self-sufficient but you were earning and you were contributing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I kind of wish\u2026 and the problem is, with\u2026 I can\u2019t even really consider what if I wanted to do the yarn business full time. With this apartment it\u2019s too small for me to do any dying in. Though I actually made friends with someone who actually\u2026 who works at a local yarn store. Because we <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F1\">had a lot of fun Saturday night and it turned out\u2026 we were talking afterwards. She had just got a job at the yarn store. So maybe I could even sell myself to a yarn store. [35:39] But then I\u2019d just have to start all over again because of the moths [sp?] and the\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s really the lack of space that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F2\">preventing me from that, but even if I had the space, even if I dyed things every day, I doubt I could sell enough to live off of. It\u2019s just so completely unlikely. Well everyone I know who dyes yarn and stuff like that is doing it as a side job.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2010E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">THERAPIST: Side job, not their main source of income.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah, so now it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even have any source of income coming in. It\u2019d be nice to have that side job so I can feel less guilty about spending money. So I just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">THERAPIST: Well if the focus is on\u2026 when I asked you what your goals were, the focus is on getting healthier and career stuff. So for this week what\u2019s reasonable to expect in terms of the steps that we\u2019ve talked about? What can you reasonably expect yourself to accomplish with career stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: I guess getting out the Providence application and possibly the Concord one, if I can get a printer to print the application on it. Yeah, because I have to\u2026 actually I need to do a lot of printing for that because it also requires a\u2026 two finding aids [sp?] and another writing sample. So\u2026 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201171\">then they all have to be printed out and mailed in in a giant envelope. [37:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: So is it more realistic to find your printer cord from that box or to take a thumb drive somewhere and print it out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking\u2026 well\u2026 oh, I need\u2026 I have to call my mom tonight. Since I\u2019ll be in Connecticut I\u2019ll have access to those printers probably. So I could probably do the application from there. So I think that would be the most realistic option. Yeah, at this point I\u2019m thinking with the printer\u2026 for <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B1\">my printer it would\u2026 just buying a new printer cord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">THERAPIST: That might be easier than finding it. But you\u2019ll be in Connecticut so you can\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll be in Connecticut so I can probably print from their computer. Yeah, I\u2019m not\u2026 if\u2026 I think my mom isn\u2019t taking her main laptop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: When do you go\u2026 when do you start the house sitting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: Tomorrow. Yeah, so we\u2019re going to\u2026 they leave tomorrow morning and we\u2019re going to get there tomorrow early afternoon I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: So then you could have that done by Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah, I could have it done by Wednesday, though I guess I might as well work on the cover letter tonight so that way I don\u2019t have to do any thinking after that. So yeah, I\u2019ll\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: That sounds like a reasonable plan. If you do the cover letters tonight and then you give yourself maybe some time off Tuesday, and then Wednesday you can do the application and then you\u2019ve done some job stuff first half of the week. [38:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about the whole\u2026 I won\u2019t be able to go to any of the dancing that\u2019s happening this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">THERAPIST: So what could you do instead while you\u2019re in Connecticut?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: I guess I could take a walk or something, depending on the weather. Yeah, that\u2019s something I could do. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: And in their house it might be easy\u2026 I know sometimes the barrier to cooking and food is your kitchen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: True, and they have a huge kitchen with lots of dishes and stuff, and dishwashers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: So maybe taking advantage of that while you\u2019re there could help make it easier to achieve some of your goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah, I could do that. It just sort of seems a little bit\u2026 is it really doing that much good if when I\u2026 I only have this kitchen for a little while and then I\u2019ll go back to having to do everything in my small kitchen and not eating healthily, necessarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20139\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s easier to do while you\u2019re at your parents, and when the hurdles are lower you might as well take advantage of that. Is it going to be enough to make a lifelong change? Absolutely not, right. We have to\u2026 I think eventually you need to figure out a way to be able to maintain some <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201391\">of those choices when it\u2019s\u2026 when you have a more challenging environment. But it sounds like this week when the\u2026 some of the hurdles that are typically up in front of you are going to be lower, taking advantage of that to get the ball rolling. Why not. And then hopefully when you come back to your apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201392\">you\u2019ll have a little momentum. And maybe the weather will be a little bit nicer, so taking walks might be a little bit easier, hopefully, as we get further into real\u2026 actual spring. [41:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m so ready for there to not be any more snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D\">THERAPIST: It will be nice when that happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F\">CLIENT: I just can\u2019t help feeling that I\u2019m really useless right now. And I mean I did go dancing one night this past week but it was only one night. It feels like\u2026 Thursday I didn\u2019t want to go to contra because it was just\u2026 well because I have the car in Wallingford, which was a couple of blocks away, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F1\">and it was\u2026 it had gotten so cold out and I just didn\u2019t want to face the cold. So I mean I didn\u2019t even really want to go swing dancing on Wednesday night but I at least made myself do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20141\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it\u2019s a couple of weeks in a row now that you\u2019ve taken advantage of some of the dancing at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which I also\u2026 I mean I guess I am noticing it really has at least improved my mobility, and now walking around is a lot easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20145\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re starting to see this effect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. but I don\u2019t see myself losing any weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20149\">THERAPIST: Well it hasn\u2019t\u2026 you don\u2019t\u2026 weight loss is a slow process. But the\u2026 some of the good effects that you get from being more active come before you actually see a difference in your weight. [42:27] And I mean I know you noticed feeling a little bit less winded, your back hurting a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201491\">less. You just mentioned that you feel like your mobility\u2019s a little bit more. So those are maybe differences that you\u2019ll be able to continue to see sooner. Weight loss, especially with only a couple of days of exercise, is going to come really slow. I think\u2026 I like to think of it as steps. Every time <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201492\">you go and make a choice to do something active, it\u2019s a good step. And you can build upon those. Dancing once or twice a week is not the end goal, that\u2019s the starting place. Keeping these routines in place weeks in a row makes it\u2026 we\u2019re hoping to change what your normal is. Instead of the normal being <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201493\">staying in and being sedentary, we want the normal to become getting up and taking a walk, going out and doing this dance thing, going and doing that dance thing, feeling like being active is your typical choice. That\u2019s when you really start to see the impact. But you have to start where you are, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201494\">start some place, and you\u2019ve taken some really goods steps the past couple of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014B\">CLIENT: Because I also notice I\u2019m still not that good on the dance floor and I just feel really bad. Not so much for the contra but for the swing dancing. And it\u2019s here I am making these people dance with a bad dancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll get it\u2026 you\u2019ll learn it again.

I just can\u2019t. And I kind of do something that\u2019s similar but compatible with it but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2014F1\">not noticing that I\u2019m not doing these terrible steps and I can\u2019t get my feet to move that fast. [44:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20151\">THERAPIST: Were you able to in the past and are out of practice or is it something that you\u2019ve never really picked up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t ever I don\u2019t remember not being able to do it the last time I went swing dancing. But that was five years ago so I think I could do it then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20155\">THERAPIST: Do you ever practice at home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20157\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t really have much space to practice. But yeah, so I\u2019m really only doing it one day a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20159\">THERAPIST: Well hopefully with more practice you\u2019ll get more\u2026 you\u2019ll get better. And accommodating until then, making little adjustments, faking it the best you can, if you\u2019re moving it\u2019s good activity. And you\u2019re not making people dance with you. (pause) What are your other things we should be checking <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201591\">in on today or catching up on?

And then he\u2019s\u2026 takes him forever to be able to want to start doing things. And he\u2019ll spend all this time on the computer <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015B1\">and just waking up, and I just feel like hours of my time are wasted waiting for him.

I don\u2019t know that you cannot be frustrated by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F\">CLIENT: Because I can\u2019t really do anything about it because if I try to pressure him then he\u2019ll feel pressured and panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you can\u2019t control somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20163\">CLIENT: And sometimes I can go off and do my own thing but sometimes things require him to come along. And then I\u2019m just wasting all this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like the choice you have to make is\u2026 you\u2019re thinking about what your choices are and it sounds like your choice on some days, when he\u2019s unable to get going when you want to get going, is your choice is do I wait and do something else while he gets ready and does his routine <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201651\">or do you go do your own thing and do something that doesn\u2019t rely upon him. [47:19] I don\u2019t know that you can choose not to be frustrated but you can choose not to wait. But you don\u2019t get everything you want. What you really want is to go do the thing you planned with him, and that might not be possible <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201652\">some days. Some days you might have to go do the thing without him or choose to wait. And I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re feeling frustrated by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20167\">CLIENT: I just need to find a way to not externalize my frustration and I\u2019m not very good at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20169\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016B\">CLIENT: So then he knows that I\u2019m frustrated with him and then he panics even more. And things spiral out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Would it be better in those cases to just go off and do your own thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016F\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2016E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561895\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20171\">THERAPIST: And then maybe come back for him? Is that a choice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20173\">CLIENT: Sometimes. I guess something is when we go out to eat he usually ends up paying because he\u2019s\u2026 well a, he wants to eat out more than I do, and he\u2019s a lot more financially self-sufficient than I am, even without having a job. So\u2026 and with\u2026 it\u2019d been a while\u2026 we hadn\u2019t been cooking because there <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201731\">were dishes that he said he\u2019d do and he kept on not doing them. Then I ended up having to wash them but\u2026 so it\u2019s between either waiting for him to be able to go out or if I\u2019m going to make something at home, doing all these dishes that I was waiting for him to do that he said he\u2019d do. And then I end <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201732\">up feeling resentful because I have to do more work and he\u2019s not pulling his fair share. [49:11] So there really aren\u2019t any good options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20175\">THERAPIST: No, but it\u2019s about choosing the option that you have control over, right. So you don\u2019t have\u2026 if you\u2019re waiting for him to do the dishes you have no control over when he\u2019ll do them. I know you feel resentful when you do his dishes but at least you can control that. You can decide okay, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201751\">not ready to go out, then I\u2019m going to make something and I\u2019m going to do the dishes that I need to in order to make whatever. Or maybe you want to start using paper or something that feels like that\u2019s more in your control. [49:46] I know that doesn\u2019t replace pots and pans but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is usually the issue, is the pots and pans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20179\">THERAPIST: And so it\u2026 you\u2019re making the choice that gets in your way the least. It\u2019s not the ideal choice. It sounds like a lot of times you have to think about which is going to be less and which is sort of going to interrupt my plan less. And then making that choice so that you have more control over <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201791\">the situation. Because you really can\u2019t make him do dishes or get ready faster. You can decide what you\u2019re going to do if he doesn\u2019t match up with your plan, but you can\u2019t control someone else, which is very limiting and very frustrating sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just\u2026 and some of it is his depression and some of it is his ADD, and I\u2019m just\u2026 I really wish I don\u2019t\u2026 he didn\u2019t have ADD. And I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017D\">THERAPIST: It feels like it\u2019s hard to be in a relationship with those issues being so severe, it sounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017F\">CLIENT: Cal [sp?] also had ADD, and with him it was worse because it would make him late for being with me. And he\u2019d just be using the computer at\u2026 into something and I\u2019d be waiting for hours. And I was\u2026 I don\u2019t ever want to do this again. And then I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20181\">THERAPIST: And here you are facing a similar pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20183\">CLIENT: Doing this again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20185\">THERAPIST: Hard. [51:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20187\">CLIENT: We do need to stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20189\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
