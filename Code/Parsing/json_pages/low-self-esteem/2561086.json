[pause] So I\u2019ve been having an issue lately in thinking about am I having a problem with dealing with my mom when she starts to like bring up stuff that I don\u2019t want to talk about. Like random\u2014like a lot of stuff about obviously diet and her diet, and also a lot of like negative stories <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">about people that I\u2019m not necessarily still connected with, or know of, or like care to know about. And I\u2019ve tried to express to her that I don\u2019t want her\u2014just to like change the subject, or I don\u2019t want her to talk about this stuff, but she\u2019s still doing it, which is making me realize, it\u2019s like, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">can\u2019t change that. Someone might\u2014her or anyone else might say or do something that is a trigger for me. I can only change the way that I\u2014like whether or not I\u2019m triggered by it or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">So but because every time I tell her like I don\u2019t want to talk about food anymore, or I don\u2019t want to talk about your diet\u2014that\u2019s great, like I don\u2019t really want to hear about it\u2014she just keeps going. And that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a trigger for me because I can\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s something about like hearing about diet plans, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">or like the next best thing that she\u2019s doing and stuff, that makes me think that she\u2019s saying that I should do that, or that I should be on that, because that\u2019s what she would always do when I was younger. And I just don\u2019t\u2014like I just don\u2019t want her to even talk about it because it\u2019s so sensitive to me. [2:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And then it\u2019s the same thing when she talks about other people, or talks about negative things. I can tend to get brought down a lot by things I hear that have happened to other people. Like even if I hear a bad story in the news or something it can really affect me because I empathize with these other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">people. And I don\u2019t want to dwell on the negatives, but I don\u2019t want that to be like a focus of conversation because I can get really wrapped up in it. But I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m having a hard time\u2014like she obviously\u2014she\u2014and, you know, some other people are like this too. She\u2019s obviously not going to change the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">way she\u2019s speaking or the topic she speaks about, because that\u2019s just what she\u2019s going to do and that\u2019s her. I\u2019m just having a really hard time in having someone talk to me about these certain things that really affect me more than other areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So it just\u2014I think I\u2019m becoming more aware of what it is, what the different things are that are affecting me or are setting off certain things in my mind. And I\u2019ve noticed that as soon as I talk to her on the phone or afterwards I have this anxiety, I have\u2014there\u2019s like all kinds of things happening, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">and I will try to not talk to her. And I actually like ignored one of her phone calls from a couple of days ago, and then because I hadn\u2019t called her back she sent me an e-mail about a family friend\u2019s son that had died in Afghanistan that I knew when I was little and haven\u2019t seen in 20 years. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">like she\u2014I think that\u2019s why she was calling me, is she wanted to say this negative news because that\u2019s how she operates. And I didn\u2019t\u2014because I didn\u2019t call her back she still had to find a way to get the negative news to me somehow, because that\u2019s what she focuses on. [5:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And I like so much do not want that to be a part of my life, focusing on only being the bearer of bad news basically. Because when I talk to her there isn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s not that\u2014obviously negative things happen and people share them, it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s her only focus is on the negative stories about other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">people, or complaints about the actions of other people. And talking to her sets that kind of stuff off in me where I can kind of get wrapped up into that way of thinking. And it\u2019s something that I have tried so hard to like get away from in my life, because I\u2019ve found maybe like\u2014I think I realized <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">this maybe three or four years ago, that I was getting like her but I didn\u2019t know I was doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">So everything was, \u201cThis happened that was bad, and this is negative,\u201d and that was my way of communicating with people too, is nothing\u2019s good, here\u2019s the bad thing that happened here, here\u2019s this happened, and so and so. And ever since a few years ago I realized that I was doing that. I know I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">do it sometimes, but I\u2019ve tried to be really conscious of it and really just like try to, you know, not get wrapped up in that and have that be the main thing that I communicate or convey to other people. And it\u2019s important to me to not\u2014to still be aware of that. And when I talk to her it\u2019s triggering\u2014it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">making me sometimes go back into that pattern of behavior, but it\u2019s like almost like it\u2019s habit and I\u2019m not conscious of it anymore. [7:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">So it\u2019s sort of like I know that I have to be able to communicate with her, and I know she\u2019s not going to change her behavior, so I don\u2019t know how I can\u2014it\u2019s almost like I want to insulate myself so that I\u2019m not triggered or set off by that stuff anymore. And I\u2019m actually really worried about\u2014I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">home next week for Thanksgiving, and I\u2019m really worried about it, because when I\u2019m on the phone or it\u2019s e-mail I can shut it off, but if I\u2019m home it\u2019s there and I can\u2019t shut it off. And sometimes I feel like when I\u2019m around her or talk to her it reverses all the progress that I\u2019ve made and then it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">like I have to start over again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. You don\u2019t spend Thanksgiving with your boyfriend or his family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: No he\u2019ll\u2014so he\u2019ll be there, which is good, because if\u2014 The worst was like I went home a few times this summer and he couldn\u2019t come with me, and I had more time off because of school, and that was very difficult for me. Because it\u2019s easier if he\u2019s there too because then he understands the situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">and I have someone to like go escape with that can kind of help me rationalize my thoughts again and deal with the situation. Because he observes what happens and is very aware of what\u2019s going on, so it\u2019s very helpful for him to be there. But it\u2019s still\u2014it makes the problem a little better, but it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">make it completely better, because it\u2019s like that I\u2019m-just-back-in-that-family dynamic again and it\u2019s all\u2014like all the same stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">You know, my dad complains, my sister complains, my mom complains, because they\u2019re all together a lot of the time and so they\u2014it\u2019s not just my mom, they\u2019re all like focused on the negative, and it\u2019s this whole, you know, way of thinking. And so being so immersed in that makes me go back to like habits <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">from that\u2019s how I was when I was part of this family dynamic. But I\u2019ve removed myself from it for a long time. But when I\u2019m put back in it I fall back into these old habits, and then it takes me like a week or two to recover basically from it. [10:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">And so I don\u2019t want to have to\u2026 I think thinking about it, like insulating myself, isn\u2019t a great way to think about it. I want to think about it more like how do I make sure that I keep the awareness that I\u2019ve developed when I\u2019m with them and don\u2019t just fall back into these habits and this like\u2014because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">immediately I eat more, like there\u2019s a lot of eating triggers when I\u2019m there, I get caught up in their conversations about other people because it feels natural to get, you know, caught up in all of this. And then I immediately am like very\u2014feel more critical of my body and of myself. It\u2019s like all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">of these things kind of happen. And I don\u2019t want to like protect myself from them, I want to be\u2014I guess be in enough of like a better place that they don\u2019t happen, or that I\u2019m like aware of these triggers or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">Like I don\u2019t really\u2014like the main way that I can think about maybe being able to like deal with things is to just remove myself more and be like aware of their actions and how they might affect me ahead of time. Like I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019ve\u2014it\u2019s sort of like I\u2019ve never been able to deal with this situation, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">I don\u2019t know how to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay. [12:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: And I feel like in terms of overall awareness of actions that I have that are more like they have formed out of habit and they\u2019re habits that I\u2019m, you know, trying to break or trying to be more aware of these actions so that I don\u2019t do them, all of that awareness seems to just like go away when <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">I\u2019m at home or with my fam\u2014like on my own or with my family. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve always\u2014I feel like everything I\u2019ve worked for is just lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I think ultimately when you feel you need them less it will be easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: The attachment is so intense right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: And when you can tolerate\u2014because it sounds like it\u2019s not only your mom who has a hard time tolerating not having contact with you, you have a hard time not tolerating not having contact with her, it\u2019s very painful for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s\u2014I feel guilty. It\u2019s\u2014it actually feels easier to not have contact with her. Like it makes things better because I feel like I\u2019m in a better place when I don\u2019t have contact, but I feel so guilty. Like I feel like I\u2019m not there enough. And the last time I went home my sister screamed <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">at me, telling me that I wasn\u2019t there enough, and that I don\u2019t go home enough, and that I\u2019m not there for my family enough. [crying somewhat] And that was like really difficult. Because I feel like it\u2019s really unhealthy for her, the amount that she\u2019s there. And I feel like I\u2019m healthier if I\u2019m not around <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">them as much, or\u2014you know, to me it\u2019s like I think talking to them once a week is fine. Because usually if I talk to my family more frequently, and particularly my mom, the stories she tells are actually the same, because it\u2019s the same bad news story that she\u2019s told again and again and she can\u2019t remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200353\">who she told it to. [15:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">And so it\u2019s\u2014talking to her less is so much better for me, and I really, really realize that. And I actually don\u2019t feel like I need to like turn to them as much, because I feel like it\u2019s just going to result in\u2014it\u2019s only beneficial really for my mom because she can unload all this stuff. It\u2019s not beneficial <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">for me at all. But I still feel so guilty. And it\u2019s\u2014because of the guilt I\u2019m going to be going home a lot in the next like month, because the weekend after Thanksgiving is my grandfather\u2019s 90th birthday. And I wasn\u2019t going to go because I thought it was just going to be too much for me, but my aunt <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">who lives in Washington State is coming, and the whole fam\u2014everyone\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s like this whole thing. And I still really didn\u2019t feel that I could go, but then my boyfriend said that he would come so I felt that that would make it\u2014if he\u2019s there it is more manageable for me, so I felt that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200373\">would be better. And then we alternate Christmas between his family and my family, and this year is my family\u2019s year, so then I\u2019ll have to, you know, be with them at Christmas. So I know I\u2019ll have to be around\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: Why?

[16:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s just the way we kind of rotate the\u2014I mean, we could go to his family\u2019s, but then I feel like\u2014I feel like my family won\u2019t like\u2014because anything\u2014a lot of times I would rather be with his family, because I really enjoy being around them and I don\u2019t feel all this like stress. Like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">just actually an enjoyable time. Like no one\u2019s talking about weight, no one\u2019s talking about like\u2014and like no one\u2019s speaking negatively about other people, like it\u2019s kinda nice. But I feel like my family resents all the time I spend with his family, and I feel like they would give me so much guilt for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">not spending the holiday with them. [crying] And then I also feel like they would think that because\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">So the hard thing is, is like a lot of the changes that I\u2019ve made that I feel have been more positive have removed me from them in ways, and I think that they blame a lot of that on my boyfriend. Like a lot of the positive changes that I\u2019ve made have been like steering away from maybe their like traditions, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">or just like not seeing them as much or\u2014you know, different things like that. And I think that they blame him for some of that. Even though it\u2019s me, it\u2019s not him. I just don\u2019t want them to feel like that way towards him, so I\u2019m kind of like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Oh, well, they will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re talking about wanting to control all sorts of things you cannot control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: And try\u2014and holding on so tight.

Because right now I\u2019m the one that\u2019s getting all this blame and everything and my sister\u2019s the good one, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">because she\u2019s always there and always with them and always spending time with my grandparents. And I think that\u2014so I feel like my grandparents will for the most part understand me not being there as much and want me to go have my own life and be happy, but I don\u2019t feel like my parents feel that way. [20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but [unclear] is if you wait for their permission you\u2019ll be waiting forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because I just\u2026 But the hard thing for me is I want to be with my boyfriend\u2019s family more because they are so just accepting and I just, you know, love being with them so much more. But I don\u2019t want to have any regret. [crying in earnest] I\u2019m afraid that if something will one day <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">happen to my parents that I\u2019ll always feel guilty. [pause] Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: Please don\u2019t be. You came to me for support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: [pause] So I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re aware of their actions enough to really\u2014to really understand why I might be distancing myself. Like I think they\u2019re totally unaware of how they\u2019ve negatively affected me. And so I\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t help them more and spend more time with them and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">do all this stuff that I\u2019ll feel some kind of a regret for\u2014you know, for not having been there more, for not having [held\/helped? 22:13] them more. But at the same time my mom is like always taking care of my grandparents and it\u2019s really negatively affected her because she feels the sense of guilt and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200552\">everything. And I see what\u2019s happened to her and I don\u2019t want that to happen to me. And I don\u2019t want to feel like the guilt. But it\u2019s like still so there, especially when my sister gets angry with me, or, you know, says I\u2019m not there enough. I just\u2014it\u2019s like the sense of guilt is so strong that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200553\">just afraid that\u2014I\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t do more now that one day I\u2019ll look back and say, \u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d you know, I should have helped them more, I should have been there more, or I should have spent more time with them. [23:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">But a big problem too though is when I do go out of my way to go there and spend time with them, half the time they\u2019re not even home. Half the time my mom is driving people to doctors\u2019 appointments and doing all kinds of stuff and they don\u2019t even actually have time to spend time with me even though <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">I\u2019m there. But the sense of guilt for me to be there is so strong. But then once I\u2019m there they don\u2019t have time to spend real quality time with me. So it\u2019s kind of like, \u201cWell, I just drove all the way down here,\u201d and all this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">And the other problem is the more that I\u2019m with them the more I see a lot of these negative traits in them, and the more I don\u2019t want to be around them. Like the last time I was around my dad he exhibited like a short temper, he was rude. Like there was all kinds of things that I noticed. And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200591\">like, I don\u2019t really want to be around that. And it\u2019s like, again, rationally I recognize that if they weren\u2019t my parents they aren\u2019t necessarily the kind of people I would want to be around. But because they\u2019re my parents and there\u2019s that connection it\u2019s like really hard to break that, the feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200592\">of guilt and the feeling that I have like an\u2014that I have an obligation to them because they\u2019re my parents. [25:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I almost get a sense when you\u2019re talking it\u2019s not only that you feel obligated to give something to them, but you almost feel compensate or make up for something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it\u2019s\u2014well, I think a lot of that though comes from the fact that I was always compared to my mom, and my mom is the one that does everything for everybody, and goes above and beyond, and has to do everything for my grandparents, and has to be the one to do everything. And so I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">think that I\u2019m supposed to play that role, but I haven\u2019t really been playing that role enough and I feel bad. And so I feel like I keep having\u2014like I have to do more, and I\u2019m not doing enough. And I feel like\u2014I mean, I also feel like as they get older I really\u2014I don\u2019t want to do what my mom is doing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">Like I don\u2019t want to have to deal with them all the time and drop my whole life to take care of them, because I want to have my own life and I don\u2019t want to negatively impact my life. And at the same time though I feel this guilt, and I feel that because they\u2019re my parents you\u2019re supposed\u2014like that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D3\">what you\u2019re supposed to do. And you\u2019re supposed to take care of your family, and you\u2019re supposed to visit them and be there for them, and if you\u2019re not then you\u2019re a bad person. [27:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">And so I really struggle with that, because I don\u2019t want to be a bad person for not doing all these things. But I feel like for my own sanity and to be able to really live my own life I need to set these boundaries. But it\u2019s just it\u2019s really hard to like\u2014it\u2019s really hard to avoid the guilt, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">if I\u2019m not\u2014even if I\u2019m not putting it on myself, it\u2019s being put on me by other people, and that\u2019s really difficult to deal with. Like it\u2019s really hard to deal with my sister saying that\u2014 You know, my grandparents are actually very old, and it\u2019s amazing that, you know, they\u2019re still with us. But my sister <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F2\">always says like, \u201cYou\u2019re not there enough to spend time with them, and something\u2019s going to happen, and you\u2019re not there to help with anything.\u201d So it\u2019s like all of that guilt, it\u2019s so hard for me to deal with those accusations, like everything coming from someone else. And then it makes me think like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F3\">oh, maybe I\u2019m not there enough, maybe I\u2019m not doing the right things. But I just\u2014I need to also live my own life at the same time and it\u2019s really hard. I just\u2014I don\u2019t know how to deal with it really. [29:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">And the thing too is\u2014like going back to the sort of needing my parents\u2014when I do talk to my mom on the phone, there is a sense that I want to unload or tell her everything or share information. And so\u2014 But if I don\u2019t talk to her it\u2019s fine, like I don\u2019t feel bad that I haven\u2019t shared the information <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">with her, it\u2019s just when I talk to her there is a need to like tell her. But it\u2019s always like pos\u2014I always want to tell her positive stuff, but there is a need to get that\u2014still to get that validation. But if I don\u2019t talk to her as much I don\u2019t feel like I need to tell someone the pos\u2014like I don\u2019t feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200612\">that I need to go around saying all this great stuff and get the praise, it\u2019s only really triggered by actually talking to her. I don\u2019t feel like, something good happened, I need to call my mom right away and tell her. Whereas I used to feel like that, but I don\u2019t anymore and I\u2019m okay with not talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200613\">to her for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">But then when I do talk to her it\u2019s like I need to tell her this positive stuff. And part of me actually wonders if it\u2019s because\u2014both to get the praise, but also because everything she\u2019s saying is so negative. And it\u2019s like I want to say something good because everything is like\u2014there\u2019s nothing good <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">about anything that she has to relay. Except sometimes she tells me good things about my sister at work or something. But that\u2019s about\u2014 [31:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">THERAPIST: So what are you thinking to do in telling her the good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t\u2026 It just sort of happens. But I think that I am trying to control her mood. Like I\u2019m always trying to tell her to focus on the positive. And I have pointed out to her that she\u2019s very negative, and I\u2019ve told her I don\u2019t want to talk negatively about other people. And I\u2019ve said all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">these things to her. And so I think that subconsciously I\u2019m thinking, well, if I inundate her with all this great information then when she takes that and has a conversation with another person maybe she\u2019ll tell them positive stuff, instead of only having negative information in her basket of stories <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200672\">that she has to tell people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">THERAPIST: But she doesn\u2019t want to talk about positive stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">CLIENT: No. Yeah. That\u2019s\u2026 The thing is like I\u2019m\u2014I think that\u2019s the issue, is that even though I know that I can\u2019t change my mom, or my dad, and their behaviors, I still\u2014like I still think that I can. I know that I can\u2019t, but I think maybe I can change them for the better. Because if I didn\u2019t think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B1\">I don\u2019t think I would be pointing things out to her, or trying to say to her like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d or I don\u2019t\u2026 And so even though I know that they\u2019re very set in their ways and very unaware of their own behavior, I think part of me still thinks that if I point stuff out I can change <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B2\">their actions. [32:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">Like I was on the phone with my mom, and I heard my dad yelling at the pharmacist on the other phone in the background. And this was after I had noticed him being very angry when he was here. And I said, \u201cMom, like he shouldn\u2019t really be talking to other people that way. I\u2019ve kind of been noticing like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">his short temper.\u201d And then my mom said, \u201cEveryone everywhere says my husband is the best and most patient when he deals with others,\u201d and like\u2026 So instead of\u2026 Like they just don\u2019t want to see anything. And so I can\u2019t point anything out to them because they\u2019re not going to\u2014I mean, I can, but they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D2\">not going to change their behavior. They\u2019ve always had blinders on when it comes to their own behavior, and I think they always will, because they don\u2019t want to change, and they\u2019re not willing to look at themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">But at the same time it\u2019s like I\u2014part of me still thinks if I could just change them and the way they\u2019re acting then I could be around them more. And then I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for not spending as much time with them, or for not taking care of them, because that\u2019s what I\u2019m meant to do, that\u2019s what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">I have to do. And that\u2019s part of who I am, is that I have to take care of them. But it\u2019s like I know that I can\u2019t change them, but I still want to because\u2026 And I think I also want them to acknowledge what they have done. [34:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">[crying slightly] So there is also a\u2014not a lot, but like probably\u2014I can probably remember all the instances of it, but when my dad or mom would get really angry they used to like hit us and stuff. And so like my mom would like pull me up the stairs by my hair, or my dad would like hit my head against <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200711\">the floor and stuff. And I don\u2019t feel that it happened\u2014like I can remember all the different times I think that it happened. But what I also remember is that after what happened, the next morning my parents would act like nothing happened. And like I remember saying something to them as I got older, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200712\">and they said, \u201cWell, if you tell someone then you\u2019re going to get sent off to like a foster home and you\u2019re not going to have a good life, so why would you\u2014\u201d You know. And that was like the only acknowledgement. [35:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">And I can also remember my mom actually being really upset about it at one point and taking my sister and I into her room and like saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d So there was some point where it was really bad. But I mean, for the most part I think\u2014I distinctly remember like five or six <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200731\">instances of it, and I don\u2019t know if I blocked the other stuff out or\u2014 But I do know that there was a point where it was bad, and I know that my dad did this because his father did it too. But he\u2014my parents would just act like nothing was wrong because they were so unable to acknowledge their own actions <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200732\">or their own behaviors, or try to change them. And I think part of me just wants them to acknowledge everything that they did. And not even apologize for it, but just acknowledge it. And they don\u2019t, because they don\u2019t acknowledge anything about their own actions. [37:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">And I think\u2014I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m still trying to like change them for the better, or, you know, make them reform in some kind of a way. But I don\u2019t think they ever will. It\u2019s just that I like really\u2014part of me just like really wants them to so that I don\u2019t have to deal with having all these difficulties <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200751\">with being around them I think. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: You want to change them into the parents that you\u2019d like them to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I feel like now\u2014like oh, now that I have, you know, gotten through so much, and now that I\u2019m so aware of\u2014of my own actions, and of their behaviors, now that I know all of this can I help them, like can I help them to be better. But I know that they\u2019re not receptive of that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200791\">and I know that they will never change. And I think coming to terms with that is really hard. Like coming to terms with the fact that this is who they are, that\u2019s really difficult. [crying] Because\u2026 this is who they are, and it\u2019s up to me to determine what I want my relationship with them to be. [39:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">But it\u2019s like at the same time it wasn\u2019t all bad, and they did provide a lot of\u2014there was a lot of nurturing, and I have a lot of\u2014I think of a lot of those moments too, and have sort of like nostalgia to them, with, you know, thinking of them. And so thinking like, oh, my mom, you know, took care of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B1\">me when I was sick, so I should take care of her. So there is part of me that I think denies or blocks out the negative too just like they do. But\u2014 So it just kinda\u2014I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just kind of\u2014it\u2019s hard to\u2014it\u2019s hard to distance myself from them when there still was that like good there too. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B2\">I still feel like they\u2019re my fam\u2014like they\u2019re my family, and there\u2019s stuff about like holidays that do bring up good, positive memories as well, and so that\u2019s always nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">But it\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s really hard to come to terms with the fact that for my own health and well-being I might not have as involved a relationship as, you know, my mom has with her mom, because that might just not be good for me. But it\u2019s hard for me to accept that, and it\u2019s hard for me to accept, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D1\">I said, that they\u2019re not going to change. That\u2019s really hard to accept because\u2014I think because I want them to change so badly.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I would too. [41:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that\u2026 I\u2026 I still, like I said, want them to just be aware of themselves and their behavior. Because I worry about one day when I have a family having them be around them, because there are certain behaviors they have that I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to pick up on or have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200811\">deal with. And so it\u2019s really hard to also think like, \u201cOh, I may not want them to have a really big role in my child\u2019s life, or I might\u2026\u201d That\u2019s really hard to deal with, because I\u2019ve always imagined my parents really, you know, being there, and through it all. But there are things that they do that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200812\">I just don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t want to be around and I don\u2019t want other people to have to be around that, or, you know, pick up on that, or mimic those actions or behaviors. So I think that\u2019s really hard to come to terms with too. Because the distance makes me feel okay, but there\u2019s still that like guilt or that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200813\">sadness that it couldn\u2019t be better. Like why can\u2019t it be that ideal relationship that other people have, and why does it have to be this way? I think there\u2019s a lot of that feeling too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20083\">THERAPIST: A lot of loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20085\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Like why couldn\u2019t I have the parents that this person had, or the relationship that this person had. And they can have their parents\u2014they can have all this other stuff, but I can\u2019t have that because if I do it\u2019s not really that healthy for me. So that\u2019s really hard to come\u2014to deal with. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200851\">I think.

And I can see myself getting there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D\">CLIENT: But I think I\u2019ll have to, you know, feel these feelings for a while, which is hard. But I know that it\u2019s the best thing for me. But it\u2019s\u2026 Like just navigating all the dynamics and the guilt coming from so many places is\u2014it\u2019s really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well, I will help you navigate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">CLIENT: Yes. And I\u2014it\u2019s like the stuff with my sister too, I want to have a close relationship with my sister, and I don\u2019t. And I want to be one of those people that has a good relationship with their sister, but unfortunately my sister is too much like my parents, because she spends so much time with <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200911\">them and she isn\u2019t necessarily aware of, you know, the negative effects that might be having. And so she\u2019s kind of defending them or spouting their viewpoints very often. And so I try to reach out to her, and I want to have this relationship, and it\u2019s not really there right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">And I\u2014I mean, I think that if she does manage to get a little bit of distance, which I think would be good for her, that maybe we could have a relationship. But that\u2019s another thing where I\u2019m like I wish I had this relationship with my sister but I don\u2019t have it, and I know that I don\u2019t have it. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200931\">we\u2019ll have really good moments where she\u2019s just herself, and then we\u2019ll have other moments where I see a lot of my parents, or I even hear my dad talking when she says certain things, and I don\u2019t want to be around that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561086\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20095\">THERAPIST: Okay, I think we are going to need to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20097\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20099\">THERAPIST: So then I\u2019m not going to see you next week, but I\u2019ll you the following week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.
