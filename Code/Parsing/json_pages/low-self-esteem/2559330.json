Sorry, I\u2019m late. My previous schedule was like\u2026that Tuesday thing I was like. I had a sneaking suspicion that you meant that the same [inaudible \u2013 02:12] or something. So. But I think now I will be able to have everything straight because I just quit my job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just like an hour ago. I had a meeting with my bosses and\u2026all three of them. So and then\u2026it was kind of nasty, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Nasty how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Well just like I wasn\u2019t able to articulate myself very well and I wasn\u2019t, I guess, very professional, so they weren\u2019t very professional. Like I should have just said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I cannot make this work so I\u2019m giving my notice.\u201d It kind of went along the lines of, \u201cI cannot make this work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and I am too distracted.\u201d I got in to needless details and I made it\u2026I was trying to be contrite. I was trying to kind of hope that they would have part-time work for me, like, but, they\u2019re like so pressed for time. It\u2019s a very very fat lady around my organization. They\u2019re always running around like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">chickens with their heads cut off so they didn\u2019t even really pause to say, \u201cOh, congratulations,\u201d or you know, whatever, you know, and \u201cGood luck.\u201d They were just like, you know, \u201cOkay, post the position now,\u201d you know. So it\u2019s kind of strange because you work for them for two years and they\u2019re already <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">just talking about replacing me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[03:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: So this is the place that you worked at part-time and then went full-time, and then you decided to leave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah because I\u2019m just\u2026I realize that just within a week that I just cannot balance school and work and writing. And now some people might even say I don\u2019t need school, but you know, I think rather than being in a full-time job, it\u2019s better to be in school because it\u2019s just the environment. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">I feel like I\u2019m more productive, I\u2019m more creative in an environment that kind of\u2026in a learning environment. So. It\u2019s probably better to be in school. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Yeah, and I forgot to do my homework. So it\u2019s like\u2026it\u2019s like I can\u2019t balance the two. It\u2019s basically [inaudible \u2013 04:53], but I feel like I should just go ahead and do it because I have, at least for the next year, I have like a job, a part-time job with Amherst. It\u2019s paying peanuts, but it will meet <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">my own rent. I mean I won\u2019t have money for my mom\u2019s rent, but\u2026 [inaudible \u2013 05:19] savings if she needs help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a big deal not to be paying her rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, just not going to think about it and deal with it that way because like she says she\u2019ll get a new apartment and if she gets employment she\u2019ll be able to take care of herself. I feel very irresponsible, but like I just cannot put this aside because I feel like I\u2019ve come this far, you know; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">I\u2019ve invested time and [inaudible \u2013 05:54] and I\u2019ve shown it to people and talking about it and I\u2019ve shown it to an agent who says she\u2019s\u2026she\u2019d love to look at the finished product. And I feel like now that I\u2019ve made a commitment I have to follow through. I have to give myself enough time to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">[06:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">But as I say all this I\u2019m panicking and I\u2019m really really worried. It seems like I have nothing to worry about. That\u2019s what I keep telling myself; I have nothing to worry about. But I don\u2019t know if that takes care of the underlying worries just like that. I mean I feel bad because like, you know, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">a grown adult. I\u2019m able and responsible\u2026I should be responsible, but my mom is having to go apply for food stamps, so. I...if I think about it too long I will be like, \u201cOh God, what am I doing? Why am I putting my mom through that?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: It just seems like such a big change. We were talking for so long about your feeling guilty and you\u2019re feeling so responsible for taking care of your mother, and it just like sort of seems so sudden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I mean it is sudden. It\u2019s a big change. I do feel irresponsible for her, but I want to be\u2026I want to see if she can take care of herself, you know. Like both of us have this fear. Like she does and I have this fear too that she cannot\u2026she won\u2019t be able to take care of herself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">Like you keep saying, you know, what is the worst that can happen? I just completely shut off when you say that. And I\u2019m like I don\u2019t want to think about that. So we\u2019re just like not only just following through and dialogue would actually fall in to practice and seeing, okay, what is the worst that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">can happen if I don\u2019t live with her, if I don\u2019t support her financially? Let\u2019s just see, you know. Like will she be able to stand up on her own? Will she be able to take care of herself? Let\u2019s find out. You know. I haven\u2019t [inaudible \u2013 08:13]. I think I did pay her rent for August. So I guess for September <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">she paid it herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">[08:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">But yeah, I mean, we\u2019ll see. And even if I do have to help her, I have savings. I mean just\u2026just\u2026you know what? I want to start feeling positive and I want to stop feeling guilty that I\u2019ve left her on her own. Yeah. I visit her like practically every day and she seems happy, you know. She\u2019s got her <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">little projects. And even if she\u2019s not happy, you know, I feel like I don\u2019t have to deal with that, you know. She has to deal with the sadness or the emptiness, you know. Like it happens to everyone. So, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I feel like I should have done something better; like I should have been\u2026had all this time just to prepare myself, but I don\u2019t think so. I think I couldn\u2019t have because Sally is just\u2026she would have hated me no matter what I said. Because I was just trying to watch out for Jeremy. You know like after <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">I quit, they would still you know, like call me for extra work. I could make some extra cash. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: What happened that you feel like you left so badly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Well you know, they really did actually make allowances for me. Because like all last year I was part-time and that was because they had juggled, they had fought with Mario, the director, you know, and now, and she\u2019s like you have no idea how many battles I fought to make this position full-time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">And I\u2019m like, okay. And I\u2019m like that just really makes me feel like you know this organization\u2026I\u2019ve had it up to here with them, you know. Like I just shut up at every single moment when I felt like screaming, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Screaming about what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Well they\u2019re just really disorganized and they\u2019re all about red tape and they\u2019re all about following the right procedure. Just hierarchy and so I just cannot; I\u2019ve worked at places where it\u2019s a lot calmer, a lot smaller and you know, things are more dynamic. There\u2019s a lot more creativity and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">not so much sticking to, you know, rules and regulations and all that. So, I mean they pay good money. The work is ridiculously easy. It\u2019s, you know, sending an e-mail. I mean stuff that I\u2019m good at, you know, design work. And like launching e-mails and e-mail campaigns and e-marketing. I\u2019m good at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">that. I can do that easily. But what I\u2019m not good at is keeping my mouth shut when people are doing stupid stuff or when people are, you know, bugging me about silly things like protocol, you know. And there\u2019s so much protocol. Like every single e-mail has to be reviewed by the top most manager, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">that\u2019s just like\u2026that just makes me mad. So I just make mistakes\u2026like silly typos and whatever. And then they pick it out and I just make\u2026I\u2019m supposed to feel bad about this but I\u2019m not going to. You know, like my brain is just not being used here. I can be so much more useful. I can do so much more <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200394\">creative stuff. I\u2019m just coffee basting over here, you know, and making good money while I do it, but I don\u2019t want that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">[12:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more important, you know, your peace of mind or you know, being comfortable. So\u2026it just feels like I know I\u2019ve burnt those bridges and that kind of sucks but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: How did you\u2026I guess I\u2019m not clear what you said that makes you feel like you burnt those bridges?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Well like cause I think they are thinking that they made a lot of allowances. Like in that meeting they were actually \u2013 again, it was just about my schedule \u2013 and they wanted; they were letting me work from home on Tuesdays and Fridays. Instead, I said no, I don\u2019t want this. I just don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">the job. So I don\u2019t know if that has made it clear in your mind. Yeah, so they\u2019re thinking that they\u2019re jumping through hoops and I\u2019m saying that\u2019s not good enough. But I don\u2019t know; I just feel\u2026and it\u2019s also like I just found out that one of my friends from MSU, she was a year after me. She\u2019s doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">really well in the sense that she\u2019s got her story published and she\u2019s a writer in residence, and someone calling me in New York, and she\u2019s getting married in December. And I\u2019m just like, I\u2019ve digressed and regressed while she\u2019s made so much progress. She\u2019s a year younger to me, so I feel a little like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200413\">I haven\u2019t made any progress. And I know I shouldn\u2019t compare because she comes from a lot, like a good family. Like her father is like a big shot in Art History and he\u2019s a curator of a museum and like he\u2019s a big name. So\u2026but you can\u2019t really compare. But certainly I feel like comparing. When it comes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200414\">to writing I feel like, you know, like her writing was worse than mine and now it\u2019s like improved beyond recognition. It\u2019s really like\u2026it\u2019s really good. I\u2019m happy for her, but I\u2019m a little jealous, you know, and I feel bad for myself that I have [inaudible \u2013 15:01] same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">[15:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">So when I see that, I just completely like \u201cShit.\u201d But then that\u2019s not really good because then it doesn\u2019t help my creativity. So now that I\u2019ve quit my job yet again, I feel like I need to prepare myself emotionally and mentally and psychologically to be the person who will write well, you know. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">I know that I feel like the admission is there. I cannot judge my talent right now, so I will just defer to my professors and they think that I have talent. So I just feel like I should just be able to\u2026I need to be in the right frame of mind to be creative, to be productive. So like not\u2026being confident <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">and\u2026I\u2019d rather make that. So maybe one at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you plan for things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m a really bad planner. I would well say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean and I\u2019m sure there is some thought process that goes on, right, when you make your decisions. But sometimes, I don\u2019t know; like it\u2019s sort of a surprise every time I see you. I don\u2019t understand what went on. Why are you doing this? It\u2019s so confusing. I guess that\u2019s how I feel. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">I feel very confused. And so I think that\u2019s why I asked that question. It\u2019s unclear to me sort of what leads you to make the decisions you make; whether they\u2019re proactive decisions or whether they are reactive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: They are probably reactive. Yeah. Yeah, I don\u2019t know the distinction, I guess. Like how I could be; how I could react differently. How I could be proactive about decisions? I don\u2019t know how to do that I guess. Can you explain the difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems like the decision to\u2026well; it seems like you decided to take a full-time job and then quit the full-time job in a fairly short period of time; like within a few months. So, yeah, I mean clearly something led you to want to take the full-time job, and then something led you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">to want to leave it. So those are very different motivations and it happened very quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">[18:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s true. That\u2019s what they\u2019re thinking and they\u2019re pissed. Well like I\u2026when they asked me do you want to come back full-time, I said yes. But in my head I was thinking no; no, I want part-time back. But then I didn\u2019t have anything to show for\u2026I mean I didn\u2019t have like a book contract <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">and I wasn\u2019t expected a book contract in a year. You know, that\u2019s just; yeah, I wasn\u2019t ready for that. But yeah, so I was just not thinking. I just was like, shit, I don\u2019t have a plan for next year except going to school. So I\u2019ll just say yes right now and I\u2019ll deal with the no later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">Now, I can say this and this phase here, but now I\u2019m thinking it was financially good for me to say yes because that made sure that I got paid for July, August, and September. Because if I had said no in June, that would have been it. And maybe I would have been better saying it in person right now <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">and had just foregone a couple of thousand dollars. But I\u2019m like at least I made a couple thousand, you know. And put myself through this misery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">But yeah. There wasn\u2019t really a well thought out plan, I guess, and it seems reactive. And it probably is reactive. I think the thing with me is that there is kind of a plan or there\u2019s a fear of making the plan, so the plan doesn\u2019t get made. And then when it comes; when the time comes then I\u2019m not prepared <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">and I\u2019m reactive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">[20:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">In fact this happened last week or a couple of weeks ago that I\u2026like he\u2026all of us we lived together. We\u2019re moving out and I basically just moved my stuff out because it was small and\u2026but the rest of the stuff basically belonged to my mom. I had some books. So he was doing all the work. He got movers <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">and rented a truck. So he was doing all the work. He moved the stuff up to my mom\u2019s place and his place.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">But I was working those days and he just got really pissed. And I just can\u2019t deal with when he\u2019s pissed. He just kinds of bottles it all in and he\u2019s angry. So he was dropping me off at work one day and I just snapped and I just went in to my boss and said I cannot work today. I have too much going on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">and I\u2019m going to need to take the day off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">So one of the tasks for that day was dropping this guy off at Harvard. He\u2019s a friend, a mutual friend, and he was starting to teach there. So I did the Harvard thing, but on my way back I got in to a car accident. And I was thinking about that and like what exactly\u2026and so, in reality, I was listening <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">to music too loud and you know, I took my eyes off the road for one second and looked up and found that the entire lane had just stopped moving on my side. So I couldn\u2019t stop in time. But I guess that happens to everyone and all that. But I\u2019m thinking, you know, I really just was not ready to take on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">this additional task. So either I should have refused the friend, or I should have stuck up to David and not care that he was upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">[21:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">And so, I mean, reacting to his anger, I got myself all worked up and here I am in a car accident. Not a wreck, but you know, whatever. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">Yeah, I guess this was\u2026what I\u2019m trying to say is that you\u2019re right; that I react. My decisions seem reactive and that\u2019s probably because I\u2019m too afraid to take a decision. I\u2019m indecisive as it is. But you know, when it comes to big decisions when people can\u2019t afford to be indecisive, I just kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">freak out. When my boss said here\u2019s a position; you\u2019ll come back full-time. I just freaked out. I didn\u2019t; I couldn\u2019t say no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: It seems like it\u2019s like other people are relying on you, but you don\u2019t want that responsibility and in a way, you resent it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well like it sounds like you know, they were offering you full-time job. It may not be something that you want. But it sounds like you were\u2026you really didn\u2019t like the way they did things. You thought they were too bureaucratic. You were somewhat resentful of how they did things. They didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">feel like they were offering you something. You felt like they were stifling you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">[23:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: It sounds like with David, you resented having to do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I know it\u2019s the wrong approach. But like I don\u2019t know how to think of it in the right way. Alright, we all need to move out, so obviously all three of us should be present to help out. How hard is it to think in that, you know, have that train of thought and follow through <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">and take the required days off? You know, how hard is it to do that? I don\u2019t know. But I didn\u2019t do it. And then I felt bad. But he was making me feel bad, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">[24:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: It sounds like, you know, you don\u2019t want these responsibilities. You don\u2019t want your work to have to rely on you. You don\u2019t want the responsibility knowing that they\u2019ve gone the extra mile to help you in the responsibility of participating and moving. You don\u2019t want these responsibilities. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">You feel like they\u2019re being imposed on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Why is that? I mean, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like\u2026maybe I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know why I feel burdened. You know. Well we all have things to do, right. So they\u2019re not like, they\u2019re not burdens on us. They\u2019re just things to do; they\u2019re just time commitments. I don\u2019t know why that is. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">that\u2019s the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">Yeah, I mean like even when I\u2019m visiting my mom right now, it just feels like there\u2019s another thing I have to do. Well maybe right now it feels like that because I really do have a lot going on with\u2026well now I don\u2019t have two jobs, but until the end of this month, I will have two jobs and school. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">this is really weird because I still have that draft of that e-mail that I was writing to the Amherst job, I think, and like refusing them actually. And I was just about to send it when instead I just sent them something like, okay, let\u2019s meet. I was like let\u2019s just go with this job for a week and see <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B2\">what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">I really just want to make it as a writer. That\u2019s all I want. And I\u2019m going about it in the most desperate, uncool fashion. Driving myself crazy in the process. Driving everyone I know crazy. Putting too much pressure on myself. Having way too high expectations and not managing those; not having realistic <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">ones. Basically, just having a miserable time. It\u2019s just this picture; very ugly, and it needs to become beautiful because I just know that it is beautiful to someone like two paces removed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">[28:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">Yeah, like friends, colleagues; some of them. They just think I have a fabulous life in the sense that when they don\u2019t know me that well, you know. At that point, they\u2019re like, yeah, it\u2019s pretty cool. They like me and they\u2019re like you\u2019re writing; you\u2019re working on your novel and that\u2019s so real nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">and ambitious. And you know, you have a nice boyfriend and a nice mom; that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: Are you an David considered together now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, but that is a whole other mess. But again, I\u2019m not in a place where I can so those things. But it\u2019s really because he has a full-time job [inaudible \u2013 28:54] okay to quit. That really makes me cringe as I hear myself say it. I\u2019m sure hoping that I will not have to ask him for money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">But yeah\u2026even if we\u2019re not together, I guess, he\u2019s agreed to help me if I need help. I was kind of hoping I would have like some part-time deal, but oh well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">[29:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">Why is it that I feel like people are burdening me with their responsibilities? I want to know. I don\u2019t know if you have any insight. Am I that, like\u2026I don\u2019t know, protective of my time? I don\u2019t think I am. I\u2019m not sure. [Silence.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">Maybe it\u2019s because I feel\u2026maybe it\u2019s because I make excuses if, you know, if I don\u2019t make it as a writer; if I don\u2019t achieve this goal, then it\u2019s because I can play the blame game. I can say well, [inaudible \u2013 30:56] my mom, you know. Then that kind of rids me of the responsibility. Then it didn\u2019t happen <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">because I didn\u2019t do something, you know. Actually, I\u2019m a chicken or something even worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: In both the cases you said today where you said, \u201cWell I can say this in here,\u201d I guess meaning speaking to the confidentiality and also like maybe no precautions or something. Hopefully you feel that way. That they\u2019re both examples in which you feel like you took something from someone or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">you\u2019re taking something from someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, with the job situation, it seemed like you felt some shame that the way you, you know, sort of the timing of the job you were able to get paid full-time when you were away. So it seemed like one of the reasons you said like only within these four walls is because you felt you were saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200911\">I took something from someone I shouldn\u2019t have taken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: And the same thing with the David. You said well that you were going to take something from him or you want something from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">[32:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And that sort of\u2026those are the two times in which you felt a sense of self-consciousness or guilt or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah it\u2019s true because in the job thing, I feel like the right thing would have been to say no, I want to be honest with them, but it\u2019s more important to be honest with myself and to allow myself this\u2026I\u2019m a person, you know. Like I have a life. I should\u2026and it\u2019s just as valid as someone else\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">life. So why can I not get that in my head and treat myself with respect instead of you know like, pussyfooting around everything and being like, eh, just make it work. I\u2019ll just make\u2026I don\u2019t want to think about it. I mean I\u2019m doing such a shoddy job with everything that concerns myself. Why is that? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D2\">Yeah, I mean I should have just said no I want something part-time. I\u2019m sorry. And people would appreciate and would love me more for that; for being, for allowing myself, for taking my needs under consideration and being honest. Instead, just for a few thousand dollars, I just said yes. I mean I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D3\">know that I was going to quit, actually, to be honest. I didn\u2019t know for sure. So that\u2019s why I kept it. And now I\u2019m thinking back and going, well I guess it was financially a good decision because I got paid for a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">[33:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">But still, you know, sitting down and planning practically does not happen because I\u2019m just like I\u2019m unrealistic and I just don\u2019t want to face my fears and don\u2019t want to kind of give myself enough time, enough thinking time, and I\u2019m like why do I have such a low opinion of myself, you know? I have needs <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">and the needs take time, you know. I feel like that\u2019s the problem. If only I could\u2026if I could just be realistic. I mean if I could be honest about myself to myself, then I would be realistic. I would be able to face my fears and say okay, I\u2019m not very talented, but I can do this, this, and this well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A12\">Let\u2019s just see what comes out of this, you know, and make a plan like that, you know. That\u2019s what Satie (sp) has done. That\u2019s why she\u2019s published. That\u2019s why she is happy; way happier right now. Well she\u2019s always way happier, but you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re angry about a lot of things and I think that the way the anger gets expressed is often in fairly self-destructive ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Like burning a bridge where you could have some money coming in that could be useful, getting yourself in to a car accident; things like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how to stop this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: One way I think that would help is to talk about and try to understand better the things that you are really angry about. There\u2019s a way in which when people hold you accountable, you don\u2019t want that. You want to sort of push back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t want that. I mean I want people to rely on me. I mean that only makes myself feel better about myself, you know. I do care about people. I mean I get described as mean and very kind and very loving. So\u2026it\u2019s not that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Did what I say make you feel badly about yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">CLIENT: A little, but I know that\u2019s because you want me to be a more positive person and so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Well, I want to help you be the kind of person you want to be and achieve the kind of things you want in life, both professionally and romantically. And to do that, I need to help you sort out all the feelings that you have that sabotage those goals. And I think there are a lot of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like \u2013 and I\u2019ll say this and I know what you\u2019ll say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">THERAPIST: You do? You know what I\u2019ll say already before I say it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yes. I was going to say if I can just make it as a writer; if I can just have this one thing that I want, then everything will be alright. And you\u2019ll say, well that\u2019s your magical thinking again. You know, that\u2019s what you said last time and it really resonated with me because that\u2019s\u2026I am seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B91\">that that\u2019s what I do like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">[38:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">Another example was like I wanted to do\u2026I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research for my novel. There are like 50 books that I need to read; 25 of which I\u2019ve read, but you know there\u2019s still a lot of reading left. So I thought of doing an independent study this semester just to get credit for it and to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD1\">that [inaudible \u2013 38:20] that way it actually gets done. And I e-mailed my professors and most of them were like, well I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea. You know, you should do research on your own time and you should really take literature courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">But the two days while I was making up this plan of independent study, I was like this is it. Now everything is going to get done. I just, you know, I love the fact that I\u2019m at school and everything is going to work out. And as soon as the e-mails are out, I was like in the dumps and it was like, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF1\">sucks. I\u2019m quitting the program right now. You know like, shit, what am I going to do? And I thought nothing\u2019s going to get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: What upset you about what they said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: Well, they just\u2026again, I thought that they were holding me back. It was weird, you know, like I\u2019m actually watching myself saying these things. That\u2019s completely ridiculous, but that\u2019s what I was thinking. I was thinking that you know they\u2019re responsible for my lack of success and they\u2019re holding <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">me back and they\u2019re just\u2026they have no idea the pain that they\u2019re causing me and you know, it\u2019s like all this bitterness which I\u2019ve kind of dealt with already because I see that\u2026I meant all those required was opening up my calendar and seeing that, yes, I can do school work three days of the week and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C32\">then the rest four days I actually have for my novels. I could still, you know, manage both things. I was just like, okay. I didn\u2019t need to get upset over; I didn\u2019t need to get upset at my professors at all. So that was just like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">[40:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like that was the feeling in the job too; that they were holding you back. They were creating all these constraints and they\u2019re sort of sapping your creativity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel that way and I don\u2019t see that I am being neurotic when I think that way. Because I\u2019m not the only one who thinks that way; it\u2019s a lot of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well I would say that in that there\u2019s a sort of level and intention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">CLIENT: In my thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sort of they\u2019re holding you back because if they\u2019re holding you back, they\u2019re sapping you, they\u2019re doing something actively to make things worse for you rather than\u2026they may be offering you something that you don\u2019t want or that you can\u2019t make use of. But that\u2019s different from them doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF1\">something against you and it sounds like you were feeling they were doing something against you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">CLIENT: I feel like that for just a little while, but like in connection with certain people and maybe, again, it\u2019s because I\u2019m neurotic or something. But I felt like they really function in that way\u2026I mean they play favorites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">[41:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">The first year I was there I wanted to do design work and was only given to this one guy who is a web master and all that. And I just felt very resentful because I thought I was a better designer than him. I didn\u2019t even think about the fact that okay, he\u2019s taking a lot of other things in to consideration <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D51\">like accessibility which is holding him back in the sense that he cannot design as nice stuff because of those things. I don\u2019t think that. Instead I thought they\u2019re playing favorites and they aren\u2019t giving me any design work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">But I mean I do see what you\u2019re saying. The distinction you made. So yeah, I do also think in those other terms that there just isn\u2019t the kind of work that I\u2019m interested in doing. So it\u2019s not really they want to hold me back but they\u2026but that\u2019s happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">Again, it\u2019s like, as I say this I know I\u2019m lying because I know that in the back of my head I feel like I\u2019m being held back. Not because of anyone\u2019s, you know, bad intentions. But it\u2019s just the end result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">THERAPIST: I mean I guess one of the things that I feel like I can help you with is this anger you feel when you feel these ways towards other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. That would be helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">THERAPIST: You feel angry and then the ways in which you try to get something for yourself, you feel guilty; you feel like they\u2019re kind of misleading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">[43:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: When I asked you about David and whether you\u2019re together, and then you sort of admitted, you know, that he has full-time job now; that the ways in which you try to get things from other people, you feel very guilty about. You feel like they\u2019re kind of on the sly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. Even if I take money from my mom, I feel that way. I feel dirty taking money for a moment. It really; in fact, that was the reason I wanted to break up with him because I thought I\u2019m not sexually attracted to him, you know. So all I can get out of him are expensive dinners <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E71\">and that makes me a slut, you know. Not in that way. And I can still think that way. So I feel like the honorable thing would be to break up with him. Now I feel completely\u2026this is happening yet again. I feel like I put myself in like this box. Here\u2019s another restriction and I need money and he\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E72\">only one who\u2019s going to offer it. I\u2019m bound to him now. And I got myself in this position because I just quit my job. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">I wish I had\u2026didn\u2019t need to think this way but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: I\u2019d like to continue to help you with these things. We\u2019re going to need to stop in a minute and I wanted to know what do you want to do going forward? I know we haven\u2019t met in several weeks. What would you like to do about the treatment?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559330\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">[45:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">CLIENT: I will have more time now that I have quit my job. So starting in October, I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019ll be home to go in in the morning. I mean I\u2019ll prefer those slots if you have them available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I do. So\u2026but you want to take a few weeks off. I\u2019m not sure what the few weeks are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, so the next couple of weeks \u2013 are there two or are there three?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">THERAPIST: So I guess two more weeks in September.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">CLIENT: Okay, so in that case, I mean if you have any time available next week or the week after, maybe I\u2019ll do one session and then like with the insurance\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Will you have insurance through the school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">CLIENT: Through the school, but I think it won\u2019t begin until November. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m saying that. Maybe you told me that or maybe I heard at Amherst.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: You should ask them. It should kick in September. I don\u2019t know why; it should kick in in the school year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: If it has, then I\u2019ll definitely find out. I\u2019ll find his out. I\u2019ll work on this on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah, let me know because then I can bill your insurance and you can get a much smaller copay. As we\u2019ve been talking about, finances are tight for you so you know. I give you a reduced fee, but I appreciate that for a limited budget, even that is a lot, especially if we\u2019re going to try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: I mean I really do think\u2026do you think that you\u2019d want to commit to twice a week starting in October?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">CLIENT: If I can have my insurance kick in, then yes. Otherwise I would probably prefer like once a week or once every two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ll talk about that. Your insurance should cover\u2026we\u2019ll look in to that more. If you want to ask, you can feel free to e-mail me the information. I can look in to it either way. If you need some help with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">CLIENT: Sure, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s\u2026I have a couple of morning times in the next few weeks.

I do; I know that you had kind of a complicated schedule and the car accident. But I do really hold people to their times because I have such limited times.
