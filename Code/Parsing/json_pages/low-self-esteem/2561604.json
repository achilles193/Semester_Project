Come on in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Forgot that this was traffic time!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t give myself extra time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I hate it when the (inaudible). (client affirms) For sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Um, so I was thinking more about how last time, we were talking about sort of how I was having these like anxiety panic attack-type things. So, something that I noticed is that (and it kind of relates to that), I\u2019m... So then like, new interactions and new situations like, for example, my new <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">job. I\u2019m kind of reverting back to... I think I had mentioned to you that when I started high school, I decided that I was going to be like, really quiet and shy so that I wouldn\u2019t upset anyone and just kind of like, keep to myself and couldn\u2019t possibly do anything to make someone not like me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">In a way, I think I\u2019m reverting back to that behavior a little bit in new situations, as I feel things out. And I didn\u2019t really realize that I was (chuckles) doing it in the new job, but I think... But someone said to me, this woman who was training me, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing really well. You just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">have to have a little confidence,\u201d because I was acting kind of like, \u201cOkay...,\u201d you know, whatever. Because I didn\u2019t want to come off in any kind of way that would upset anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So, I was going into the situation acting very like, demure and very shy and almost like I didn\u2019t know anything, I just want to, you know. In one way, it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m training, so I need to hear what they have to say,\u201d but in other ways, I\u2019m discounting myself, because I\u2019m going into this with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">actually more knowledge than a lot of the people that are, you know, doing this job. Because it\u2019s more like entry-level, and I\u2019m discounting myself by acting like, really demure, like I don\u2019t really know anything and sort of... (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So, I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve done that in other new situations before, but I haven\u2019t really noticed that I\u2019ve done it until now. But sort of going along with that, it\u2019s like... I feel like, in this new situation, I\u2019m sort of totally putting myself down. It\u2019s giving me anxiety in regards to like, the people <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">that I\u2019m interacting with. So, I was introduced to (by a girl that I worked with who didn\u2019t really, necessarily know my background), to like, a couple of, one of the dieticians. I acted very like, like polite, but very shy and almost had like, anxiety about meeting this person because in my mind, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">was like, she\u2019s so much better than me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">Like, I\u2019m thinking that all these people are like, so much better than me, and a lot of it has to do with weight, though. Because a lot of it is not, I\u2019m, I think I\u2019m, I mean, I\u2019m selling myself short a little bit, thinking like, \u201cThey know...\u201d You know, and they do know more than me. They know so much <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">more than me, but I\u2019m also looking at them, and the first thing I\u2019m looking at is, \u201cAre they thin or are they, like, is there any way they could be like, slightly overweight?\u201d Because then, I would feel better, because... So, a lot of it is going back to like, me just feeling like (in a hospital setting, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">feeling like everyone is medically trained), so they\u2019re going to notice even more that, about like, how heavy I am. They\u2019re going to see that and they\u2019re going to immediately think things about me, because they have medical like... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">So, I\u2019m really selling myself short. I\u2019m like, sort of acting like this very shy, unconfident person, when in other settings, it\u2019s like, that\u2019s really not who I am. I know that this is something I\u2019m good at, because I\u2019m, I\u2019ve started talking to patients and stuff and I\u2019m, it\u2019s something I\u2019m really good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">at and really enjoy. I know I have this good knowledge base that I\u2019m building on, where I can really do this. It\u2019s something I\u2019m really finding joy in, but when I\u2019m dealing with other people in the work place or in the profession, I\u2019m like, selling myself short. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">I\u2019m finding that when I have interactions with people that I\u2019m like, perceiving (or I\u2019m holding them up on a pedestal and perceiving) that they\u2019re so much better than I am, I\u2019m getting kind of like, nerve, almost this weird anxiety where I\u2019m acting shy and having these like, weird behaviors that just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">It\u2019s not really making me come across, you know, very well and it\u2019s not really showing the knowledge I have or who I am. But it\u2019s sort of like, when I\u2019m in a new situation, and I\u2019m feeling things out, I\u2019m like, reverting back to this old behavior that I used to have. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve done it before. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">It\u2019s (chuckles) just this is the first time I\u2019ve really noticed that I\u2019m doing it. (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">(pause) But it definitely has a lot to do with... holding... And I mean, I think it\u2019s like in any new place. I\u2019m sure, when I started my job a long time ago, I might have, I probably acted that way, and I probably thought, \u201cOh, this person is so high up.\u201d And then, as I got to know them, I (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">probably realized, you know, \u201cThey\u2019re not any better than me.\u201d It probably, you know, kind of, it did go away over time, because I know that they\u2019re, you know, by then, I had a lot of confidence, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">I\u2019m sure that, as I\u2019ve reasoned things out, it would go away, but it\u2019s especially in now working in healthcare though, I\u2019m even more so like, thinking about, \u201cAre they thinking I\u2019m like, the same as the patients that are overweight? Are they thinking all these things about me?\u201d When I know they are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">probably not; they\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWhy is she being, you know, so quiet or something.\u201d But I just, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m holding... If someone\u2019s like, if I perceive someone as thin and they\u2019ve like, achieved whatever in their profession, I\u2019m like, putting them so far above myself. I\u2019m thinking like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">\u201cOh, I\u2019m so far beneath this person because, you know, I haven\u2019t achieved all this, you know...\u201d Education stuff, yeah, but in addition to that, I\u2019m like, \u201cI must look so like, fat and like, not put together to this other person. Look at them and look how like, high above me they are.\u201d It\u2019s making me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">it is making me sell myself short and act like, quiet, and just not really be myself almost. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Among other things, you feel so conspicuous. (client affirms) It\u2019s like, really just feel conspicuous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I just, well, because and I notice that like... There was a girl that\u2019s, you know, much younger than me and like, she\u2019s, you know, taking some college classes. Just like, you know, doing this job at the hospital, and she was training me and taking me on some different like, rounds to go visit <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">the patients. I noticed my body language, that I was sort of standing like this like, sort of trying to, in my body language, I was trying to make myself like, smaller. Like, and I, I was like this, \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d I was trying to stop myself from doing it, but like, in the way that I was carrying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">myself, I was trying to, it was like, I was trying to act like, small and not like, you know, walking around with confidence. I was, my body language was very much like, closed, smaller, like... (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">And so... I noticed like, I was like, this is really, it\u2019s not just... you know, talking and trying to say, \u201cOkay, what do you want me to...\u201d It\u2019s my body language, too. I\u2019m... I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m so beneath all these people, that I\u2019m just trying to be as small as I possibly can. And I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">to be small (chuckles), you know? I want to carry myself with confidence. But I\u2019m not. So I\u2019m sure like, I\u2019m sure with anything, over time, that will change as I adjust. But at the same time, it\u2019s like very exacerbated, it\u2019s very like, I just want to be... small. I don\u2019t want to upset anyone, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">want anyone to think that I think I\u2019m anybody, because I\u2019m not anybody. I\u2019m nothing. Like, that\u2019s... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Did you feel like you feel threatened by them, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Oh, I, well, no. I don\u2019t think that anyone would feel threatened, because I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking like, \u201cI don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m anybody,\u201d as opposed to \u201cI don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m somebody.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Well, if that\u2019s like, that\u2019s the weird sort of thing. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m automatically thinking like, \u201cThey must think that I\u2019m a nobody. So I\u2019m just going to act as small as possible.\u201d Like, it\u2019s just (sighs), it\u2019s sort of like... especially because I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, because I\u2019m doing this job, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">they must think that I, you know, didn\u2019t go to college or something or like...\u201d Even though I know that people in the hospital probably know that actually, there is a lot of nutrition students like, doing this job. But in my mind, I\u2019m thinking like, \u201cThey must all think like, everyone here is so far <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">above me, they\u2019re RNs, they\u2019re doctors, they are nutritionists,\u201d and I\u2019m just like, this person. I want to act small, but also, my body is so big and they must see how big my body is, like look how much room I\u2019m taking up when I walk around and look... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">Like, and so, especially like in a crowded elevator or something. Like, I\u2019ll get in and I\u2019ll think like, \u201cThey must think the elevator is going to break, because I just got into it.\u201d Or they must... Like, I... It\u2019s like, I feel small and I want to be small. But physically, I feel so big and like, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">I\u2019m perceived physically as so big. So I think that\u2019s part of the body language thing, too. It\u2019s like, I want to be smaller. I want to sort of hold my arms in and be small, because my position is so small, but physically I\u2019m so big and everybody must be realizing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel, you know, in talking about how you acutely self-conscious you feel, do you feel that in here when you talk about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: (pause) A little. Like, well (sighs), I mean I think I just kind of always feel like that. (chuckles) Unless... no, I mean... I think I just always sort of feel bigger. Like, I just, I think, I think it\u2019s more like... I\u2019m more hyper aware, maybe, when I\u2019m in the hospital, because it\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">you know, we\u2019re dealing with patients that have a lot of health issues because of weight, or because of other things. But that\u2019s part of it. So I feel that everybody around me, that\u2019s medically trained, knows how bad it is to be overweight, and that when they\u2019re looking at me, they\u2019re automatically <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">thinking things, because they know how bad that is. So I think it\u2019s like, a setting where I\u2019m more hyper aware, because I feel like those people like, know more about how bad it is. So I feel like they would notice it more, even though I mean... The only time I notice it about other people is when I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D3\">making them better than me (ph) in some sort of a way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">So I\u2019m, you know, looking around and saying like, \u201cLook at all these nurses and doctors. They\u2019re not overweight, because they know how bad it is. I bet they run a million miles a day and fit it all in. How do they do it? They\u2019re so much better than me.\u201d Like, that\u2019s like, how my thinking is working <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">in that situation. It\u2019s making, it\u2019s making it worse than it like, normally is. So normally, I\u2019m always pretty self-conscious or always like, pretty, feel pretty aware, or feel pretty like, large compared to everything else. But in this situation, because I feel that people are like, trained in this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F2\">area, I\u2019m very hyper aware of like, \u201cWhat are they thinking? What are they thinking? (chuckles) What are they thinking?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">So, it\u2019s a lot worse than it would normally be. It\u2019s like, exacerbating the whole issue. So, and especially, it\u2019s like... I met this other girl, who was training me (who is actually in the same program as me, around the same age, but she\u2019s almost like, done). She\u2019s in her last year and she\u2019s, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">worked in the hospital as well, and so she\u2019s kind of like, in this supervisor kind of position. So she was training me and the whole time, I was thinking, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be more successful than me, because she\u2019s so thin. And she...\u201d You know, it doesn\u2019t matter if I have a better rapport with patients <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">than her, because, you know... I noticed that like, (chuckles) she wasn\u2019t very friendly. But, I was like, \u201cBut she\u2019s going to be more successful than me, because she\u2019s really little and really thin.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">Because of that, even though we\u2019re the same age and we\u2019re in the same program, she\u2019s just a couple of, you know, years ahead of me, I was acting sort of like, making myself small and being embarrassed to talk to her, and you know, being embarrassed to talk to her about even some of my interests, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">doing spinning (ph) and different... Because I was thinking, \u201cShe\u2019s going to think, \u2018How could this girl like to work out or do certain things because she\u2019s so big?\u201d Like, she, like so the whole time, I was like, really hyper aware and really self-conscious, because I was like thinking, \u201cWhat is she <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">thinking? What is she thinking?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">So, stuff that I\u2019ve been able to get over with people that I trust, or that I know well, so that I don\u2019t... Like, when I see people that I know well, and trust, sometimes I do think, \u201cDo they think I\u2019ve gained weight? Or...\u201d But, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not as like, constant, really because I trust them. Whereas, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">in this situation, it\u2019s like, this constant, \u201cOh, what does she really thinking? What is she thinking? What is she...?\u201d So, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s just like always on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">And it\u2019s sort of, it\u2019s preventing me from showing the really good knowledge base that I have and... I mean, I still think, you know, when I\u2019m interacting with a patient, it kind of goes away, because I\u2019m just, you know... So, that aspect of it like, the active rapport and all of that, is fine. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">more when I\u2019m, when I\u2019m interacting like, with other people in the workplace that it\u2019s an issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">(pause) And it\u2019s just, oh, it\u2019s like... always on.

Can I find, like...\u201d You know, or, but oftentimes, I\u2019m just picking out all the people that aren\u2019t, and thinking like, \u201cHow do they do it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">all? Like, what do they do? How do they... Can I, I want to be that. Like, I want to achieve that, I want to...\u201d Then, it\u2019s like, this constant thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Sounds so exhausting!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) But it\u2019s sort of like, it really is like, now that I think about it, it really is going back to this, it\u2019s almost like a defense mechanism (the acting really small or trying to be quiet). It\u2019s like, that defense mechanism that I used when I was younger, because I just didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">want anyone to have anything to say about me. But now, it\u2019s like, that plus this super, hyper like, focus on weight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">(sighs) I do think that... So I do think that if I... I feel like, if I lost weight, it would go away. But I don\u2019t... I mean... I don\u2019t know if it would, but I feel like, in my mind, I\u2019m just always thinking like, \u201cMedically, how are they looking at...\u201d Like, so because the other thing is that I sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">of like, as I learn more, and as I do more like, with anatomy and physiology and different things, I am... I notice that sometimes like, when I get anxious maybe about, it could be about something else, I\u2019m becoming a bit of a hypochondriac, because I\u2019m thinking like, \u201cI\u2019m so fat, I\u2019m going to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">a heart attack,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m so fat, I\u2019m going to get cancer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so fat, like...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">I think that. I keep thinking like, all these things are going to happen to me. Then I think like, \u201cIt\u2019s because of something that\u2019s (sniffles) in my control (crying).\u201d I don\u2019t know how, like, I keep thinking that, I keep feeling like I\u2019m going to kill, I\u2019m killing myself by being fat, and it\u2019s because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">of something that\u2019s (sniffles) in my control. And I feel like, I keep feeling like... oh, like... because sometimes, if I know I\u2019m having (chuckles) an anxiety attack, but I feel like, maybe I\u2019m like, having a heart attack or some... And I know that I\u2019m not, and I know it\u2019s anxiety. But I keep thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">like, that all these bad things are going to happen to me, and that it\u2019s because of something that\u2019s in my control. If I (sniffles) could just do better and if I could like (sniffles), I feel like, (crying) if I can just do better, if I could just lose weight, everything would be better. (crying) I\u2019m sorry. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: Please don\u2019t apologize for crying.

If I could just have enough self-control to overcome it, then (sniffles) everything would be okay, but... (crying) But for some reason, I feel like, I feel like I like, self-sabotage myself by not doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">enough, and like, not restricting my diet enough, and not working out enough. Like, I feel like... I feel like I\u2019m harming myself by not doing enough of the things that I know are right, and that I know are like, what\u2019s needed to lose weight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">And I feel like, I feel almost like it\u2019s like self-sabotage like, (sniffles) I feel like, I know what I need to do, but for some reason, I don\u2019t\u2019 do all of it, and because of that, I\u2019m not as thin as everybody else, and because of that, (sniffles) I\u2019m going to have, I feel like I\u2019m going to have all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">these medical problems, and all this bad stuff is going to happen to me. (sniffles) I feel like people are always going to look... Like I almost feel like... I almost feel like well, I\u2019m never going to lose weight. I\u2019m always going to be like this. (sniffles) I\u2019m always going to feel small, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200572\">of it. I\u2019m going to have these issues in the future, because of it. So it\u2019s almost like... but I don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t make myself do all these things that I know that I need to do. Like, I (sniffles)... because I feel like, if I did do them, and I did lose weight, a lot of my problems would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200573\">go away, but I can\u2019t. Like, I\u2019m not self-motivated enough to be able to do all these things that I feel that I need to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: Here is my thought about what you\u2019re saying (client sniffles). Here is one of my thoughts. (client affirms) Things being okay was completely not in your control growing up at all, and that\u2019s a terrifying feeling for a kid to have. (client affirms) You developed this way of thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">how you can control things. Sort of a whole system that I think has very little to do with your weight (client affirms), but it\u2019s a way that you\u2019ve organized yourself, and made yourself feel like things are not going to spiral out of control. The problems it\u2019s caused, the problem is that it\u2019s caused <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200592\">sort of other problems (client affirms), sort of this hyper focus on your weight (client affirms), and feeling like somehow you\u2019re just not good enough (client sniffles). But I think that what you were describing before (about not being okay, you just need to make things okay), I think this is absolutely <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200593\">a carryover from your childhood, and just sort of this panic that something horrible is going to happen (client affirms), that\u2019s taking the form, you know, of your impending death (client affirms) or your future death. (client affirms) But I think it\u2019s sort of a way to name something that just feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200594\">nameless. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I, I mean... That\u2019s, it\u2019s (sighs)... It\u2019s sort of like, but what I, I guess what, what I don\u2019t understand is (sniffles), I feel like I have this... Sometimes I feel like I am somehow like, preventing myself from losing weight, in a psychological sort of way, because (sighs)... I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B1\">like I\u2019m, you know, making excuses to not go to the gym or like, being lazy and not cooking dinner. Like I (sighs), I feel like I\u2019m... and I mean... part of me like, wanting to do all of these things is part of the control thing, but like, I feel like it\u2019s something else, because... I almost feel like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B2\">I know what I should do, but I\u2019m just not doing it. It\u2019s almost sort of like, it\u2019s something psychological that I can\u2019t overcome in order to like, do all of these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">I mean, part of it is like, a lot of times like, when I\u2019m at the gym or in a class at the gym, I think, \u201cIs everybody thinking I\u2019m the fattest per ...\u201d Like, I, you know, think all of that stuff. So part of it like, overcoming that kind of fear. But the other thing, too, is like, if I do start to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D1\">lose weight, I... Once I know, which is why I actually haven\u2019t weighed myself in a while, because once I know that I\u2019m losing weight, I like, almost like, sabotage it. Like, as soon as it starts, I... like eat extra or you know, stop the work , like I do something to sabotage it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">So (sighs)... I feel like there is something there like, there is a part of me that, you know, and I wasn\u2019t always like, but like, there is something about it right now, where I\u2019m like... resisting actually losing weight. Like, there is something there, and I don\u2019t know... I don\u2019t know what it is, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F1\">it\u2019s not like, I\u2019ve been able to lose weight in the past and I\u2019ve been like, but... (sighs) There is something like, the past few years, where I haven\u2019t been able to, and it\u2019s because I\u2019m sort of like, resisting it or there is like, something to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">THERAPIST: And that could be somehow related to what I was saying. I don\u2019t know exactly how. (client affirms) It could, I mean there could be so many reasons for it. It could be sort of an identification with your mother\u2019s vision of yourself as a kid (client affirms), a deep identification. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200611\">I believe that that\u2019s true. (client affirms) There is that whole other piece to it. I mean, what you\u2019re saying... Like, I\u2019m sort of speaking to this panic that you feel (client affirms), but you\u2019re saying there is also kind of a \u201creality piece\u201d (inaudible) something (client affirms), which, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200612\">but I mean, sort of (inaudible) both. (client affirms) But you want to understand that piece of it, too. I appreciate that\u2019s an important piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, because it\u2019s almost, it\u2019s like, well, it\u2019s like the way my mom and the way I thought other people saw me, but it\u2019s also... It\u2019s almost like... Now, it\u2019s like, this has been my struggle for the past few years. Like this is... I\u2019m like, like in my mind, I\u2019m like, waddling around as a fat <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200631\">person. Like, that\u2019s... part of it is like, become that identify that like, I\u2019ve made for myself, too, now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">It\u2019s like, so... And then I sort of look at it like, old pictures of myself just like, longingly like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be like that again? Why can\u2019t I just get there and like, why... Why did I do this to myself? Why can\u2019t I just be back there again and not have done this to myself?\u201d Like, why...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">So I sort of, a lot of it, too is looking back and saying like, \u201cWhy did I let myself get here, because now it\u2019s so hard and now I can\u2019t do it. Why did I think I was fat back then (because I wasn\u2014...\u201d Like, it\u2019s so, a lot of it, too is like, for (inaudible) and like, sort of like punishing myself for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">like, \u201cWhy did I, why did I like, get this far?\u201d So like, a lot of it is like, almost like living in the past and like punishing myself, and not letting myself move forward, really. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20069\">It\u2019s like, I\u2019m in this holding pattern, where I do, actually I feel more fulfilled in other areas than I have before in my life, and I\u2019m really happy about that. But then it\u2019s like, I\u2019m preventing myself from being completely okay and happy. Like, that\u2019s almost what I feel like. I feel like... I\u2019m kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200691\">of like, how you were saying, I always want to think like, something is wrong like, there is always going to be like, a problem or there is always... I think it\u2019s sort of has to do with that, because it\u2019s like, now that I\u2019m starting to feel really fulfilled in areas of my life where I don\u2019t remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200692\">really (chuckles) feeling fulfilled before, it\u2019s like I\u2019m keeping this thing, and now this one thing has become everything, because something always has to be wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B\">Like, I always have to be a failure in some way. That\u2019s kind of how I feel like. I feel like because, growing up... and I think the way like, my mom has always viewed things is like, \u201cThere is always something wrong, there is always, you know, this person and this happened, this, you know... There are <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B1\">always something wrong to fixate on.\u201d I kind of feel like, I\u2019m not allowing myself to have a lot of things be right. (therapist responds) As more and more becomes right, and as I feel like, really great like, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know I could feel this good,\u201d and you know, in certain areas, it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B2\">what\u2019s the one bad thing that\u2019s still there? It\u2019s my weight. And my weight is going to ruin my whole life and here is how it\u2019s going to ruin my whole life.\u201d So now, it\u2019s like, the weight is like, really like the main terrible thing, but that\u2019s (chuckles) why I sort of feel like I\u2019m like, continually <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B3\">self-sabotaging and preventing myself from losing weight, because... there always has to be something wrong. My weight... I can find a way to have my weight make everything else be wrong, even the things that are feeling right and good. I can see a way that my weight would influence all of those... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Like you could die? Prematurely?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah like, I could die or you know, I could... No one will hire me as a dietician because I\u2019m so fat. Like, I\u2019m, even all the areas that I\u2019m like, feeling really good about, I\u2019m like sabotaging everything because of the weight. Like, I\u2019m letting it effect every single area of my life and I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F1\">basically (even though I\u2019ve had all these great successes), I\u2019m making my weight be like, my biggest failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20071\">THERAPIST: Maybe on some level, you feel that if everything is okay and good, that you won\u2019t have any connection with your mother. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. Yeah, I mean it could be. Like (sighs), because I feel like, with my family, it was always like, there is always something wrong. So, like (sighs)... the other... I don\u2019t talk to my mom this frequently (chuckles) anymore, but the other day, she had called me. (sniffles) I hadn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200731\">talked to her in a while, so I called her back. I was like, you know, \u201cWork was really great today and then I also got nominated for this position in a practice group and like, things are going really well, and I...\u201d She was kind of busy, and kind of like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s great.\u201d Like, \u201cThat\u2019s great...,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200732\">but kind of like... dismi , like it was kind of like, when you have these really good things, she\u2019s like, \u201cOh...,\u201d but if I said, \u201cI\u2019m so depressed,\u201d or like said something like that, then she would have time for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561604\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20075\">So it\u2019s almost like, something needs to be wrong to get her attention, or to like, get her love almost. There has to be like, something that\u2019s wrong and... That\u2019s the other thing, too. Like, not just with her like, because I\u2019ve adopted some of her behaviors, it\u2019s like... (and I\u2019ve tried to be more conscious <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200751\">of this), but it\u2019s like, when you talk to people, instead of focusing on all... And now I\u2019m trying to do this more like, when I talk to people, I\u2019m like, \u201cI love my new job, I really love school,\u201d like, I really focus on the positive. Whereas before, I would be like, \u201cEh! My job is okay, but it kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200752\">of sucks and this is kind of...\u201d Like I would say all these like, bad things, because the way that I learned to interact with people was to bring up all of these like bad things that had happened. Like, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the behavior that I learned. And, so I feel like that\u2019s sort of hard too. It\u2019s like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200753\">It\u2019s almost like, conversation pieces, like having bad things is like, the way that you relate to someone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20077\">THERAPIST: Dangerous. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20079\">CLIENT: But, yeah. Like, that\u2019s the way that you make connections, but you don\u2019t make connections over good things. You make connections over bad things. And, so I think that\u2019s kind of part of it, too, is like, that\u2019s just how I learned to interact with other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well, Felicity (sp), we\u2019re going to need to stop in a little bit (ph).

That\u2019s fine. I also have to, I\u2019m going to look. Your insurance company is paying more than I thought they would, so I\u2019m going (client responds) to adjust your co-pay.

You...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20085\">CLIENT: So you think it\u2019s because, though, was that the one from the consult?
