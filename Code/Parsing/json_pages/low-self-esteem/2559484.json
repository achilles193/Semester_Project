data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Sorry. (Pause) (Exhaling) Oh God. (Pause) How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Good, thank you. [0:06:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: (Exhaling, sniffing) Just a few minutes late (chuckling). My mom's staying over, so it's a little crazy (chuckling). She hurt her back yesterday (chuckling), so she's kind of not able to move at all (sniffing). (Pause) (Sighing) [0:07:00] I can't remember what we were talking about last time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">I don't know (sniffing). Kind of (inaudible at 0:07:17) (chuckling). No, but I've been working. I just forgot to check my e-mail and... or look at notes from previous... I guess I can talk about this weekend. I had a bit of an up and down (chuckling). It's very, very dramatic, the ups and down... well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">the downs are more dramatic than the ups, but it's just been really busy with a lot of things. [0:08:02] And then the intensity of keeping busy and being involved in so many different things makes me feel useful, and I'm doing something (sighing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And then on Friday night there was this event, like an open mic thing. And I was invited. I don't know these people that well, but I thought I'd go. And then I decided I'd read something. I was thinking the best thing to do in such a crowd is to read something funny, something short and funny. I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">usually produced funny stuff? My stuff is usually heavy and all that, poignant... or that's my goal anyways. [0:08:59] But Chris's (?) always said, you're so funny, you make me laugh. So you should do something funny, so I thought I'd give it a try, [a bit of a set] (ph), produced something satirical. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">And I had two or three hours, so I just produced something. And... just to give myself a challenge, trying something new, or... like, can I have clarity, and can I make my prose really well-edited and well-structured? And it came out really nice. And I read it, and it took me, like, fifteen... ten to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">fifteen minutes to read it out. And everyone was listening, and everyone was laughing and having such a good time. And Chris was impressed, and he was like, how long have you been working on it? I said, like, just, you know, when you went to (inaudible at 0:09:52), like, two hours. And he was, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">that's really good, and people in the crowd compared me to, oh, this bestseller book. [0:10:02] You're like her...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, like...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: This book that this... I don't know if you've heard of it, but it was on the bestseller list, and it's like a... this woman produces satirical stuff. It's like David Sedaris, kind of. She's not as popular because she just started. So it just felt really good, that I could do something like this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">I was happy that I tried something new and kind of wasn't stuck, you know? And miserable and all that. So that was nice on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">But then Saturday was a complete... I was so down, just such a big change. (Pause) [0:10:59] Just, I don't know, suddenly just some of the things that Victor (sp?) had said to me came back to me. And I was just miserable. I was crying, and (sighing, chuckling, sniffing) after a long time I visited his <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">page. I was looking at some of his photos, and I realized this girl that he is supposedly seeing... I mean, I know about it because I can put two and two together, but he's not very public about it or anything. But she's gone ahead and liked every single one of his photos (laughing). It was just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">I was just a bit surprised by that. I felt very angry and jealous and all that (sniffing) even though I had no reason to. [0:11:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559484\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">And she changed her own profile picture, and she has that look, you know? Like that sex daze that... I can just tell, you know (chuckling)? And I was just feeling so stupid that... like, wow. I mean, she moved to the area in December, and already... and he's still in Nepal, I think. And they've met <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">for, like, a month, and she's already head over heels in love with him or something. I mean, right? I mean, who would do that? Isn't that peculiar to go and like someone's... all of someone's profile photos (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: I've never used Facebook. I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: What (laughing)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) I will take your word for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Why don't you use Facebook? We can talk [crosstalk].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I don't... [0:12:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: You're missing out on all the craziness (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well,(inaudible at 0:13:10), Chris keeps saying, don't use it, don't use it! I'm like... unimaginable not to (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Do you take my not using it as a sort of sign that you shouldn't either, like, it's not morally upright to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: No, no (chuckling). I can think of a lot of good uses of Facebook, so (laughing)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I know. It's a very good way of keeping in touch with people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, but not just keeping in touch, like, promoting stuff? So I've joined this new group of... a women's initiative in the area, and we're doing a panel discussion on this very famous case in Nepal that's picking up a lot of women (ph). And a lot of them are protesting all over the world for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">this woman, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Who was raped and then died, right? [0:13:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, not this... actually, yeah, that has...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: But didn't that happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it did in December, but this other woman, she's a tribal. And she's been held for absolutely ridiculous charges. They're not true at all. It's just the state is taking... it's just... because they live in mineral-rich areas, these tribals, and the government wants the minerals. The government <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">wants all these multinational companies to go in and basically just take all these resources for development purposes and just... they just want the tribals to disappear, and we're talking about millions of people. Anyway, so we're doing this event, and sort of promoting this on Facebook (sighing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: How did...? Did you just go...? How did you learn that she had liked all of Victor's pictures? Do you go on his site frequently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: On his page. No, I've stopped going on his page. It had been a few weeks (chuckling), so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: What point... after you sort of did this reading, what point after that did you go on his page?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess that evening or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I don't know, I just... Saturday just started weirdly. [I heard] (ph)... I made friends with this woman, she's a journalist. She's a friend of another friend who's... who I think very highly of, she's a historian, her book just came out. But this woman needs some help with some translations <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">and stuff, so she asked me. [0:16:01] And suddenly I realized... I just said to myself, you know, you are like tier three or four or five, and you want to be in tier two or one. And you're not. And people like these people are in tier one (chuckling). I just told myself that and I felt very sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559484\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">And then we... she'd won this award that... I mean, she won like the senior level of that award, but I'd applied for it, and I didn't get it. This was, like, two years ago. I mean, there's many reasons why I didn't get it because they don't give it to people who are already... it's like a travel grant, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">and they don't give it to you if you've already... if you already are from that place and you say you want to go there. So, I mean, there could be many reasons, but... not just to do with my abilities. [0:17:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">And then (sighing) we were making plans (ph), and Chris was like, will you stop hovering around? Or something he said, and I just felt very awkward and judged. He was like, I can't not say anything. I can't not be... I can't be nice to you all the time. And I was like, that's true, but maybe that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">why I'm getting therapy, so you can (chuckling) be normal around me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: And what's the connection between your being in therapy and him being normal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Oh, I told him, I feel judged, you know? I'm feeling awkward right now. And when you told me not to hover I felt weird. And then he was like, well, I can't be nice to you all the time. [0:18:00] Well, not like that, but (sniffing), I mean, he can't treat me like a porcelain doll. So that's why <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">I said, well, you know, that's the reason why I'm getting therapy, so I don't have to be so insecure all... so that I don't feel insecure all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Hmm. How did you feel, like he was being not nice to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, I just... I was just feeling like... I was feeling very low about myself, and I think of him as being in several tiers above me (chuckling). So I felt, I don't know, very meek, very small (chuckling). I wanted to disappear, but there I was hovering (chuckling). [0:19:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Over him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well, it's very... we have a very small kitchen, and he was making... and I wasn't helping, which is not to say that I... he's the only one who could cook. I mean, I cook, too. And he doesn't feel like he's hovering (chuckling). I don't know if I'm making sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yes, I think I'm following you. I guess I'm trying to understand the connection between feeling really good about yourself and getting all of this recognition and compliments to feeling really terrible about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: That's what I'm trying to understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I can't understand it (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: At what point did that shift take place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: The night was over, the reading was over, we went to bed. I was exhausted from working so hard. [0:19:58] And I woke up, and it was Saturday, and then I saw... you know, this woman had won the award. And I told myself, those are people who get the awards, not me. So then that's (chuckling)... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">then I felt bad again. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: How did you feel about her getting the award? Did you feel she deserved it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, she's been published, and she's been... I mean, yeah. [0:20:56] (Sighing)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559484\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: That's not quite... maybe that's your answer. That's not quite an answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Do you think she deserved it? Well, she's had other accomplishments. Wasn't it based on your performance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Well, if two people are performing and an award is given for performance, other people's past achievements don't seem a direct correlation to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: I don't understand, sorry (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Well, if two people run a race and one of the people is known to be a good runner, why does it matter if...? What does that... how does that influence who wins the race? Their history, if they're being evaluated on their performance for a given time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... meaning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well, I didn't... you were making the connection. I said, do you think she deserved it based on her performance? [0:22:03] And you said, well, she's had success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: No, but that... I guess they look at that, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: I see. I didn't understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Oh, are you saying that they look at the proposal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: I didn't... yeah, I didn't understand.

I see, I didn't understand the connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And so when did you find out about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Just Saturday morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Okay, now I get it. So you had this great achievement on Friday night, and then Saturday morning you learned that you didn't get the award.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: No, I didn't apply for the award this year. I applied two years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I see. [0:22:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah. I just... I didn't decide to apply to the... I mean, I knew the award, and I wanted to... well, I didn't apply to it previously because I wanted to go to Nepal. And I'd heard that, if you're already from there-and I've lived there 15 years-they would not take my application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: But I applied anyways, and I didn't get it. And that could be a reason, I'm saying, but it also could be that whatever. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Did her accomplishment then make you feel that your accomplishment the night before was less?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: What I guess I was thinking was the... well, I guess I was... I don't know. I was trying to see... I mean, well, I wasn't thinking, you know? [0:23:51] I was just feeling, so what I felt I guess was, I should just be happy with little achievements like local open mic things instead of setting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">my sites up too high or expecting too much or... I don't know. I just felt, like I said earlier in the top tiers... and I'm not... I don't belong there (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Because I don't have the same achievements. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: But your life isn't over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: What came to my mind is being stuck in a particular caste system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:24:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Like that's how you feel. If you're of a particular caste, it kind of doesn't matter what you do. You're sort of stuck in that caste. When you said tier, that's what came to my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559484\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, hmm. (Pause) Well, I just... I was really very... I took it very hard when I learned I didn't get the award two years ago. And I'd learned about it only through this colleague at MSU, she'd applied for it. [0:25:55] And she was actually, like, the worst of our group. And I'm not making <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">it my own judgment. This was the professors'. They were like... because we were workshopping together. And every time the professor would actually be very, very mean to her and just say, you cannot do this, you cannot... and she actually cried, it was that bad. But they wrote her a recommendation for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C32\">an award, and she applied months before it was due. And it takes a lot of research. You have to contact your... the country in which you want to travel and get them... get educational institutions to write you recommendations letters as well and come up with a snazzy kind of project. And she got it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C33\">(chuckling). And I was like, oh, maybe I could get it, too. But I didn't apply that year. I didn't apply the next year. But the following year I did. [0:26:56] And yeah, I didn't get it, and... despite being told that I was better, this and that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">But it could just be that she... it's very diplomatic, all these things that... I wanted to go to Nepal, and they only have a certain number of scholars that go there. And they have preferences. It was very, very regulated. Like, they'll only take people who are interested in certain subjects and favor <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">those over others, and... yeah. And for her country that she wanted to travel to she hadn't (ph) lived there in... for a long time, as long as I'd lived in Nepal. So (sighing) all these considerations are there. You're supposed to take those into account and not take things personally. But it's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C52\">at the end of the day (chuckling), it's like, she got it, I didn't. [0:27:59] Her credentials are much stronger now than mine are. But then I'm like, how much of my credentials not being strong have to do with my psychological problems, my putting myself down and not even trying things (chuckling)? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C53\">And I feel sad about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: What about that makes you sad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Well, just the potential, like, I could do stuff, you know? I mean, try different things and see what I'm good at instead of just putting myself in a box, like, in a coffin and just being (ph) like, okay, that's it (chuckling). I can't do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Hmm, in a coffin? Not just a box.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Well, might as well be a coffin because it's like, you're practically dead, you think. You can't do anything. [0:29:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: But clearly there's something in you to, say, go to the open mic night and read something that you wrote, that there's some life. You're not in a coffin at those moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just wish I could prolong those moments or just have more of them (chuckling). It's like something happens to me. I just pull the rug from under my own feet and make myself fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Hmm. At what point did you decide to look at Victor's profile?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: I don't know. (inaudible at 0:29:45) and... I don't know (sighing). I had a lot of work to do on Saturday, so I was doing that. [0:30:02] And then I had to go meet someone. Maybe it was before I went out and? Or after I came back. I don't know. (Pause) (Sniffing)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559484\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I asked because I'm trying to sort of follow the sequence of your feeling really good about your accomplishment and getting a lot of recognition to the next day feeling badly, that... sort of that's a drop in the bucket compared to more prestigious things, and then seeking Victor out. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">I was sort of just thinking about that progression, sort of what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's a good point. I mean, maybe it's like a destructive kind of a tendency to throw it all away. (Pause) [0:30:56] I think I sought him out like that last year when I'd given up hope of everything (chuckling, sniffing). (Pause) But now maybe it's, I'm seeking him out digitally not... <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">electronically, not physically or anything, because I know it will cause pain. Maybe there is a tendency in me to harm myself psychologically (chuckling). I mean, there must be. If I tell myself all these negative things, then I must want to hurt myself like that (chuckling). (Pause) [0:32:00] Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D92\">I think... I mean, he is a source of pain now, I suppose (chuckling). (Pause) It's funny how that happens. Like, people are a source of joy for you, and then, when things go bad, they become a source of pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And what's the pain you feel when you look at his profile? [0:32:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Oh, I don't know, like, rejected and dumped and (chuckling) not good enough and all the things that he said. Not deserving of his love. (Pause) (Sniffing, sneezing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Thanks (sniffing). (Pause) [0:33:59] I guess at those times I really fear for myself. I feel like (sniffing), am I [a part of this] (ph), but will nothing be enough? Will nothing satisfy me? You know, working so hard (sniffing) and trying different things and trying to be a part of different <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">causes and trying to meet new people as much as I can, you know? Despite all the constraints of my time and all that. And still, it's like, the next day it just gets wiped off (chuckling), literally, you know? (Pause) (Sniffing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: It's almost like you get erased, like you have no permanence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: What do you mean (blowing nose)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Like, when you talk about the next day getting wiped off, it's like... I don't know, you get erased, like, who you are. You're just... or what you are sort of... that what's left is someone who is kind of at the bottom. [0:35:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Hmm. At the bottom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like, by Saturday, you're at the bottom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Everyone does better than you, everything you've done doesn't really count. So much of you is erased.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: And you're like... when I think about tiers, I also think, like, on the lowest rung of a ladder?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why that happens (chuckling), but [I feel it happen] (ph). And I'm... the ramifications are dangerous, I think. (Chuckling) [0:35:56] I got drunk on Saturday... well, drunk as in... not that drunk, but... and I think I was dancing by myself and did something with my neck. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F51\">I couldn't move it (laughing). And I think Chris came back. He'd gone to visit some friends. He came back after midnight, and he's telling me, you were crying so much and (chuckling)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: What were you crying for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: I think... I don't know, Victor and the rest of my... and me (chuckling, sniffing). (Pause) [0:37:00] I guess it happens to people like me. Like, you get a little something, but either it's not enough or they're just so insecure or not confident about themselves, that the next day they think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">oh, I don't know, whatever. It's not good enough, or (chuckling)... (Pause) [0:38:00] It's like there's no stability, no permanence to who you are. It's so fluid. It changes from moment to moment. And you can't really build anything when you're like that, you know? I don't know what you (ph) want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F92\">build, but it just... yeah, seems very shaky. I guess build relationships (chuckling). (Pause) [0:39:00] (Sniffing, sighing)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559484\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">Chris said, I just shouldn't leave you for too long, and... you know (chuckling)? [0:39:59] Just like, yeah, that's exactly what (inaudible at 0:40:06). Funny because, you know, I feel relieved, and I feel excited in maybe the wrong way, doing my own thing. He kept making me feel bad about not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">with him to his friend's place. But I was happy that I had something of my own to do because that... they're just all his colleagues and a bunch of professors. And, I mean, they're great and smart and everything. But I had my own thing to do, and I like that. But it also literally puts distance between <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB2\">him and... Chris and me (sighing). [0:41:01] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It upsets him to see you like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). It upsets me more (chuckling). I don't want to... I guess I want to get to the bottom of why I am like that. [0:42:02] How much of it can I change, and how much of it won't change, you know? (Pause) Positivity just doesn't stick. It's like a thing, like a... some... that I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">made of or I have kind of an oil surface or something (chuckling). Water just slips right off (chuckling). [0:43:00] It doesn't' permeate. It doesn't let seeds grow (chuckling). (Pause) Is this just like self-deprecation, or is it something more (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Well, you know, just not letting positivity sink in. Like, that's how you build. That's how you get better at what you want to do, you know, take baby steps. [0:43:56] And you acknowledge and account for the successes that you have. But to me it just seems like a great wind blows, and it just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">goes right off. So I have to start from scratch. I guess that's what you mean by being on the bottom tier. And I look at myself like that. I haven't made any progress. I'm still here. I'm still stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: Well, your accomplishments become meaningless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why (chuckling). (Pause) It's like I deliberately wanted to hurt myself. Like... I don't mean in a dramatic way of cutting myself or anything like that. [0:44:57] But drinking and (laughing) I don't know, head-banging? I don't know what I did (laughing), just completely stiff now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: You know, Cecelia (sp?), we're going to...
