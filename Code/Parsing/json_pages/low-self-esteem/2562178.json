(sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s on your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: The long list of things I need to do that I haven\u2019t done yet because I suck. (pause)  I\u2019m sorry. That was kind of a conversation killer, wasn\u2019t it? (sniggers) There is class I\u2019m teaching at work, Statistics. It\u2019s at 1:00 on Wednesdays. I intended yesterday to prepare lecture notes and examples <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">for class today; and not because I was fucking around, for one, but we have this design review coming up next Tuesday and so my boss asked us all to submit drafts of our slides by Monday evening. First thing when I got in yesterday, I had feedback from some of the people who had reviewed my review, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">so even though I have until the end of the day today to get edits back out for a second round of critique, I spent all day yesterday working on my slides instead of preparing for the class. Now I\u2019m kind of screwed because this class is at 1:00 today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I leave here around 9:20 and I tend to get to work around 10:10. I have an 11:00 \u2013 12:00 meeting, which gives me a little under two hours to get my lecture notes and my examples done and also eat lunch. The examples require coding and mining data from the rows and I am just unprepared, wildly and dramatically <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">unprepared. I understand the material; I can talk about the material ad lib if I have to \u2013 not ad lib, extemporaneously. That\u2019s the word I was looking for. Why do I have trouble coming up with the right nouns? I know the material. I\u2019ve read the relevant chapters in three statistics textbooks and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">Wikipedia pages. I\u2019m pretty confident that I know the material, but I don\u2019t appear prepared because I don\u2019t have the examples ready. The problem is that this particular topic is hard to find relevant examples because it\u2019s kind of foundational.  (pause) I don\u2019t have a whole lot of experience and skill <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">with managing a classroom. Because these are my peers and, in some cases, my superiors, it\u2019s extra challenging versus a room full of college sophomores. (long pause)  There is that. And I\u2019m behind on my frustrating [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:15) magazine and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to have time, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">I have like 40 stories that I need to plow through, some of which are over a month old, which is bad. The schedule is on the book I\u2019m producing very badly for a lot of reasons. I got shut down and couldn\u2019t deal with ordering type last fall, so I didn\u2019t order the type until January and it didn\u2019t arrive <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200155\">until the last weekend in February. When I ordered paper I ordered the wrong paper, which was stupid of me. Last weekend I went into the shop. I thought that even if I can\u2019t print because I have no paper, I can at least set the type and then I can print when the paper comes in.  I spent a total of 17 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200156\">hours over two days in the shop and didn\u2019t actually manage to set any type because of a whole laundry list of stupid incidents, some of which were my fault and some of which weren\u2019t. There is this guy, Howie. I think I\u2019ve mentioned him before. He\u2019s in his 60s or 70s. He knows a lot about the shop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Here at the Harvard shop as opposed to the other one.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562178\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes. The other one costs $5 an hour to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you mentioned Howie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Howie is an asshole. He kept interfering and getting in my way, so I had this type which came in four big bricks this big around of individual letters, so I had 4,000 individual pieces of letter that had to be sorted and put into the case. The case is this big with internal dividers so there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">is a compartment for each letter.  I pulled down a standard case and Howie yelled at me and told me not to use a standard but to use a double [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:13). A standard case is this wide and holds all of the characters for a single font \u2013 lower case, upper case, numbers, punctuation, et <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">cetera. By font, I mean a case and a size, so Garamond, Italic, 10 point. A double case holds two fonts by making each compartment smaller; half its size, in fact. You could have Garamond\u2019s Italic 12 point in there with Italic 14 point side-by-side in the same case, which totally works if you have a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">small amount of type. Howie was like, \u201cWe have all this type and that\u2019s not displayed yet. We have all this type in back storage still in boxes. We need to be able to display it and we don\u2019t have any more room, any more cabinets or type cases to put type in. I\u2019m moving all of the type from singles into <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D4\">doubles.\u201d  I was like, \u201cWell, okay, but this font doesn\u2019t even fit in the doubles.\u201d He was like, \u201cYou should try it anyway.\u201d I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s 4,000 characters. It\u2019s not going to fit.\u201d \u201cYou should try it anyway \u2013 and you shouldn\u2019t be buying fonts without getting permission from the chapter anyway.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D5\">Never mind the fact that the reason we have so much font in boxes filling up not just our office, but our secondary office and another student group\u2019s office and they\u2019re kind of pissed at Howie for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">Howie keeps buying fonts that we don\u2019t need or want without the permission of the chapter, but let\u2019s leave aside the hypocrisy there. The other reason we don\u2019t have room is that Howie won\u2019t let us get rid of fonts that are obviously bad, so ones where we\u2019re missing seven letters and you can\u2019t print <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">anything that requires a \u201cq\u201d, a \u201cu\u201d, a \u201ct\u201d, a \u201cz\u201d or \u2013 I don\u2019t even remember what the other letters are missing, but are missing. Or fonts where there is so little type that you can\u2019t print anything larger than a business card or fonts where the type is so damaged and worn that it\u2019s hard to read.  You <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">should just scrap those. They\u2019re no good anymore. Type is meant to be molten down and reforged and, yes, it sucks that there are no traditional foundries using traditional processes and we\u2019re stuck with monotype fonts. It\u2019s kind of sad to see vintage foundry fonts get melted for slag, but when they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">not using the type . . . We can\u2019t use it; it\u2019s unusable. (sighs) I started filling the double case and, as I predicted, I ran out of space before I was even a third done or half-done distributing my type, so I had to move it all to a single case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">Then also, Howie insisted that I had to distribute the type for a composing stick. I have a brick of type this big; a composing stick is about this big. [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:57) this big. A composing stick is about this big.  Typically when you buy type, it comes in bricks sized to slide your brick <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">into the composing stick, slice open the paper with an Exacto blade. The bricks are wrapped; the paper holds it all together in shipment. It\u2019s typically newspaper. So you just slide the brick into your composing stick, slice it open with an Exacto knife, and you\u2019re good to go. The composing stick allows <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">you to move type from wherever you set it to wherever your type cases are. The problem is that with a brick this big, it\u2019s hard. And there were no spacers. So typically when you\u2019re actually working at a job, you have a line of type and just the flexible feet of lead, slide it in, and then the next line <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">of type. So we get leading from the visual typesetting because the actual lead you put between lines of type.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562178\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard the term leading if you\u2019ve ever set text. In Framemaker or the other big digital print-making newsletter you can set up the leading, which is the space between lines.  This is actual lead, so you will have a thin, flexible piece of lead that you slide in and that lets <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">you take a line of type and you have these two sheets of lead on either side. You can squeeze the lead and then the compression will hold your type in place once you pick it up and move it safely. My brick of type from this particular type caster didn\u2019t have any in them, so it was very hard to manipulate <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">the type and move it around without knocking it over and making a mess. If you knock it over, then it\u2019s no longer sorted. It\u2019s not easy to see what letter each character is. Len was like, \u201cYou should put that in the composing stick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: The basic gist here is that you have tons of teeny little letters that you need in some kind of order and also not spill them all over the place. And so these tools help you to manipulate and move the type without trouble. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes. Actually, I have a picture. I cheated because I was frustrated on Friday night. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: What are those?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the type.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: The little sticks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: They\u2019re about an inch long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: I see. I don\u2019t have anything to judge scale, so they\u2019re about like that. What\u2019s on each one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: There they are, all standing upright and aligned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: So they\u2019re like this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Where are the letters?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: The letters are on the top surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So if the type was sort of rectangle like this; here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: No, the type stands up vertically, the long way, so it\u2019s tall and narrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay, got it. I was wondering how you can see all that? All right. So you have a bunch sitting there like this, like crayons in a crayon box. They put the spacers in and all of the colors in some particular order that gives you what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: So Howie kept insisting that I had to transfer the type to a composing stick before I could put away the case. I was like, \u201cOr I could move the case off the composing bench and put it next to where I\u2019m working.\u201d Typically, you don\u2019t do that because you need the whole stone area so we have this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">giant granite stone that\u2019s like 3\u2019 x 2\u2019 that you use to lock up the type.  I\u2019m not going to explain what locking-up is, but you use it to lock up the type; and you can\u2019t have anything on the stone when you\u2019re locking up type because it would screw up the locking up process. I wasn\u2019t locking up type, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">so wouldn\u2019t this just move it easier if I put the letters in immediately and then I don\u2019t have to . . . But Howie was like, \u201cNo, we have to move it into a composing stick.\u201d Well, because there wasn\u2019t leading in the block of type, every time I tried to move a chunk of the type into a composing stick, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">it fell over and got unsorted and [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:30). Then Howie dropped my phone on the floor three times on purpose, which is why it\u2019s cracked.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562178\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: I noticed there were cracks in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: He did it on purpose. So the first time, I had run an extension cord from the front of the office to where the shop is because there weren\u2019t electrical outlets in the back of the shop. I had my phone plugged in charging and he tripped over the cord. That was probably an accident. But then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">picked it up and made sure the cord was flush against the wall and put the thing on a shelf. Two minutes later he\u2019s rummaging around on the shelf I put my phone on that he saw me put it on and knocked it on the floor \u2013 oops.  I picked it up and put it on the shelf again and then he goes and picks up <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">the extension cord and says, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be out. This should be put away,\u201d and starts winding the extension cord around his arm while my phone is still connected to it via the charger which, of course, pulls my phone off the shelf and it fell on the floor. That time, he looked at it, looked at me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200473\">looked at it, looked at me, and paused for four or five seconds and then said, \u201cOops.\u201d That was pretty clearly intentional. Asshole. The point of that whole long story is that I didn\u2019t actually set any type because it took me two days just to put my type in the case, which is annoying and I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200474\">a loser even though I did [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:53). I\u2019m super stressed about the schedule now because I have a lot of work to do and not a lot of time left to do it in.  A lot of that is my fault, but it feels really shitty; not to mention being behind on preparing lecture stuff for work. I was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200475\">to plan a big birthday party, but I\u2019m just too tired and don\u2019t have the spare brainpower to figure out what I want to do or call or set anything up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: This would be for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yep. Last summer, an acquaintance I am not friendly with had one of my favorite musicians come to her house and play a house party for her birthday. I wanted to do that, but none of the musicians I would have wanted to invite were able to make it. Helen is touring in Toronto and Delia is touring <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">in the Pacific Northwest, even if I were willing to pay for plane fare for them.  Even though I was willing to pay for plane fare, schedule-wise and stress-wise it wouldn\u2019t work. (pause) This sucks. I didn\u2019t do any planning and now it\u2019s going to be come hang out at my apartment and have pizza and cake, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">which is not the worst, but . . . I\u2019ll be a power of two. I wanted to do something special and I didn\u2019t do anything special because of this whole domino effect of things piling up and stress piling up and timelines and schedules.  (pause) Penelope asked me to move my birthday party because March is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B3\">her birthday month, so everything that happens in March is her birthday celebration. (laughs) That look on your face \u2013 yeah. Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t know how I was taken in by her cult of personality for so long.  I suppose that\u2019s how cults of personality work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562178\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">THERAPIST: When is your birthday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">CLIENT: Next Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: Happy early \u2013 Tuesday, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: Thank you. (long pause)  The last big birthday party I had was for 27, which was also a special number, a perfect cube.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been a perfect cube.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. It might be a while before I get another one. It was great. I rented out the big tub at the Inman Oasis and we went hot tubbing [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:25) and came back to my place. It was fun. We watched silly movies all night. My birthday parties as a kid all sucked. Only one person <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">showed up to my sweet 16, even though I invited my entire grade. That kind of sucked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">CLIENT: It was quiet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It is quiet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: It was, but now it\u2019s making noise again. Strange. (long pause)  I\u2019m kind of tempted to just call in sick to work today. That would be wrong. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m struck by the various nickel regimes that you find yourself under with Penelope insisting that March is her birthday month or Howie at the print shop or, even in a maybe somewhat more benign but totally also in a way, all that\u2019s involved in setting type and dealing with stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">in the print shop or your schedule at work; and how you\u2019re kind of squeezed out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: The work stuff is my own fault for choosing to work on slides yesterday instead of preparing my lecture notes. I could have worked on lecture notes. I should have worked on lecture notes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: I see what you mean, that there was a decision for you to make. There wasn\u2019t somebody else doing it to you, but I imagine in a way it\u2019s similar in that I suspect you didn\u2019t actually make a decision. I imagine it was more anxiety-driven than that. You were probably worried about your slides. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">I\u2019m just speculating here, but you felt dominated by something \u2013 whether it was a sense of they sucked or you sucked or you were going to suck if you got [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:36) \u2013 or something like that; that you were worried about it not being right, as opposed to \u201cI could to work on that, I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">work on that. What seems like the right thing to do? Let me think about it.\u201d Again, I\u2019m just guessing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: A big part of it was I was producing flow diagrams for my components and some of the things I had in the Visio diagrams were slightly wrong and I had left some things out.  There were some things that the reviewers thought were extraneous. Visio is almost like a video game, in that it\u2019s visual, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">it\u2019s graphical, and you\u2019ve got all these thousands of things that can be maxed or optimized, like is this going to look better with a half line or a three-quarter point line? Et cetera. Once I started moving boxes around to make room for the changes that had been requested \u2013 I thought it was going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200672\">be a quick job. And then I spent all day tweaking the fucking diagrams. Diagrams \u2013 plural.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: Because of the big optimization problem with 500 moving parts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: And there is no clear right or wrong answer. Readability is such a vague goal to shoot for and there are many ways to achieve it.  It was blech.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562178\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Is it just kind of obsessive or just kind of fun?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: Both. I typically work until 6:00 6:30, but I had a voice lesson at 6:00, which means I had to leave right at 5:00, so I lost an hour of my day. I meant to make up the time once I got home, but I had a voice lesson and then a piano lesson and then got home and prepared dinner. By then it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F1\">9:00 and the last thing I wanted to do was log into work and think about statistics; but I felt like I ought to have, so instead of doing anything fun or leisurely, I was just on Twitter all night talking to my friends about how I should be doing statistics and work but I wasn\u2019t because I suck which, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F2\">as you can imagine, did wonderful things for my mood and self-image. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: I can imagine. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: I need to be better about either doing my work or making a clear decision that I\u2019m not going to do work and, therefore, I\u2019m just at liberty now. The in-between spaces, trying to force myself to do work when it\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m not going to get any done is just no good for me. It doesn\u2019t help <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">me; it doesn\u2019t help the people I owe work to; it doesn\u2019t help anyone really. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know how to go from recognizing that this is unhelpful behavior to actually correcting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: I see. You\u2019re sort of talking, I think, about the procrastination phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Yep. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: I imagine for you it\u2019s that you\u2019re being squeezed into it, like at a time like last night, squeezed between, I think, how overbearing the work itself can feel and how on the other side, and in a way, not subjectively, how overbearing your conscious can feel if you\u2019re not doing the work.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">This is like an unhappy medium. I appreciate that this absolutely does not address your question of what to do about it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve tried rewards and punishments for myself. I\u2019ve tried CBT techniques like self-talk and all of that stuff; and I just end up doing end runs around them all.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you feel like you\u2019re procrastinating here, that you\u2019re sort of talking about these things, but in some way that\u2019s not really picking them up or really doing something so it\u2019s like they\u2019re kind of here, but not really. Something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: I\u2019d be lying if I said there wasn\u2019t part of me that felt that way. You\u2019ve explained your methodology to me before multiple times and I trust you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s something that rests \u2013 that feeling of procrastinating here \u2013 I guess it sounds like it rests at least on me and maybe on both of us, although you feel . . . (pause)  In that version then, I\u2019m sort of inviting procrastination?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s more that \u2013 and you\u2019ve told me before \u2013 that even if I don\u2019t see the utility of things immediately or if I feel like I\u2019m being off-topic or irrelevant, that it\u2019s useful because of the whole being able to spur associations to things that are relevant. I also kind of am just sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">here just bullshitting you and, obviously, stonewalling. You\u2019ve pointed that out before. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: But I think you\u2019re also saying that those ways of reasoning are set against a feeling which is quite different, which is . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562178\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: That I am just wasting your time and mine. Which is not unique to this, just so you know. It\u2019s something that I feel with my voice instructor and sometimes with my friends, that I\u2019m being useless here and just wasting everyone\u2019s time. Sorry, you\u2019re not special. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: Actually, I had the other impression when you said it. I had a sense that you were generalizing \u2013 not because you were concerned about my feeling special, but because you felt bad saying that. It may be partly the way you\u2019re going about this, but partly about the way I suggested you go about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200891\">it aren\u2019t working or aren\u2019t working in the way that you want. It feels like a waste and you felt bad. So okay, Brian, it\u2019s not just here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
