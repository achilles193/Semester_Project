I was feeling really good after we met on Friday, but on Saturday I found out that like a friend was engaged, and I have really bad reactions to other people getting engaged, I have a lot of like jealousy and stuff about it. So I started feeling really, really, really down over it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">And I noticed that that set off a chain of, you know, putting myself down, and sort of all of those behaviors, and it\u2019s probably taken me until about this morning to like recover from that. So almost what happens is I feel so sad, and so down, and so jealous and angry, there\u2019s all these kind of feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">that come up over it, that it takes me a long time to feel like I\u2019m back in control of my feelings. So I definitely realize that that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a trigger for me, that I notice that when something happens that\u2019s almost a trigger it sort of sets off this reaction of like really putting myself down, and comparing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">myself to other people, and it takes me a while to sort of come out of it and talk myself back up into like a normal state. So I thought that would be good to talk about actually, because it\u2019s obviously something that happens and I need to be able to deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So what do you feel jealous about when you think about it? [2:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well, so usually what initially happens is I feel like, oh well, either they\u2019re younger than me, or they haven\u2019t been with their boyfriend for as long, like all of this kind of stuff. And then, you know, with this particular friend I was like thinking, you know, she\u2019s skinny, she\u2019s perfect, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">she has it all, now she has this. I\u2019m nothing, I look sloppy, I don\u2019t look the same, and I\u2019m not engaged. Like so I have everything wrong and she has everything right. So it\u2019s like this comparison with other people, it\u2019s like checking off these boxes kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And then once that starts it\u2019s not just even about the person that\u2019s engaged, to like we\u2019re at another friend\u2019s for dinner and they have, you know, some new car, or she was doing some workout. It\u2019s just comparing yourself to everybody in general. It sort of sets off this like checking off of boxes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">\u201cWell look, she has this, I don\u2019t. She has\u2014\u201d You know. So it sort of starts with that, or with the idea of the engagement and feeling like that\u2019s something I don\u2019t have and they have it, and I should have had it before them. And then it goes into like appearance stuff, or just even like, you know, their <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">house looks more in order than mine, it\u2019s cleaner. Then it sort of spirals into like all kinds of comparisons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It sounds exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I feel like it really took me several days to come out of it. Because I\u2019ll just feel really down and just be putting\u2014I\u2019ll look in the mirror and put myself down, and just putting myself down all the time. And like last night I was supposed to go out for an old coworker\u2019s birthday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">but I didn\u2019t go because I didn\u2019t want people to see what I looked like because I thought that I looked so bad. So it takes me\u2014 And then this morning I kinda like tried to make\u2014if I make schedules for myself or do different things it helps me to come out of it because I feel more in control, so I tried <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">to do that, and then I feel better and more positive. But it took several days to bring myself out of it.

Yeah. I mean, I think a big trigger would be like other people either getting married or having babies. Like those are two things that makes me feel like I\u2019m behind, or like I\u2019m comparing myself to other people. And the whole like Facebook thing doesn\u2019t really help because people are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">always posting all this different stuff about what they have or what they\u2019re doing. So if you see that you\u2019re saying, \u201cOh, now someone else got engaged. Yeah, someone else is doing this now.\u201d And so it\u2019s a lot of stuff like that where it kind of brings out these feelings that I\u2019m having and makes me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">feel really like negative towards myself. And then it like\u2014with the whole engagement thing it also makes me feel really angry towards my boyfriend, because\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: For not proposing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it makes me feel like, \u201cLook what you did, now there\u2019s another person. And now if we even got engaged it wouldn\u2019t be the same because it\u2019s already all these other people did it.\u201d So it\u2019s kind of like I feel negative towards him for no\u2014he didn\u2019t do anything, it\u2019s just because of someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">else. So I want to be able to stop comparing myself to other people, because I think what it\u2019s doing is just making me put myself down a lot, and making me set some like unrealistic expectations for myself too. And I like to be able to like not immediately sink into that really, really, really sad, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">jealous, angry place, I would like to be able to talk myself out of it. [7:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">Because ideally I want to be happy for other people, but every single time I\u2019m not. I mean, I can\u2019t, I just sink into this\u2014 Like a couple\u2014or I guess like a\u2014a couple years ago? yeah\u2014when my boyfriend\u2019s sister got engaged, I was in my basement crying. Like it\u2019s just every single time it\u2019s happening. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">I want to be able to just not have it happen anymore, just not go to that dark or\u2014place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess if it\u2019s just\u2014if everyone is on one ladder, one person up means that you\u2019re one down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s sort of like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: If that\u2019s sort of the framework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s\u2014even if I see someone that like lost weight or something. like that then it\u2019s like they could do it but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s like always\u2014there is always they\u2019re up here and I\u2019m, yeah, like down here basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like, if I understand correctly what you\u2019re sort of describing, all the thoughts\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [9:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Is there\u2019s both\u2014you mostly feel\u2014feeling down on yourself. But it seems like it starts to feel like, \u201cI should have that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: And then it goes to, \u201cI must be crap.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: \u201cIf I deserve that too, I must be crap.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s sort of they\u2019re both in the kind of\u2014maybe like in dynamic tension with each other, I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Mm hm, yeah. That\u2019s definitely what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: At first it\u2019s, why don\u2019t I have that, and then, here are all the reasons that I don\u2019t have that. And in addition to me not having that, yeah, like here are all the problems. This person looks put together, I don\u2019t. This person\u2014 You know, so it\u2019s just this kinda whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: This might be a funny way of putting it, and I\u2019m not implying that this would be intentional, but I\u2019m wondering\u2014like going to that place about like, \u201cOh, something must be wrong with me,\u201d it distracts you from staying angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You know, and rather than being like, \u201cI\u2019m just so angry. I want that too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Right. So it\u2019s almost like then you\u2019d be\u2014you know, it moves you away from being angry\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: \u2014[overtalk] that\u2019s part of the function. Like that maybe it\u2019s even harder to just be angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it could be. And I think a lot of it\u2014well, I think of where it comes from too is like in the past when I\u2019ve had these conversations with my boyfriend a lot of it is centered around reservations he has based on my behavior, or based on me. So I think every time it happens I think that could <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">also be why I immediately turn to looking at myself, because of these conversations that we\u2019ve had, and because I feel like, well, it must totally be on me, and if I was more together, or if I had it more together, then it could be me, but I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: So is it then a frustration with yourself, like why can\u2019t I just be better? Whatever that means, I don\u2019t know. Or like why can\u2019t he give me what I want? Or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It\u2019s more\u2014it\u2019s become more why can\u2019t I just be better. I think it used to be more of like why can\u2019t he give me what I want, but now I think that I\u2014I get a bit angry at him, but I almost do turn it around on myself, because I need to be in control of everything. And so even though it\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">that he would be doing, there must be a reason like that I am controlling that\u2019s prohibiting him from doing it. Because I think I need to find blame or ways of controlling every situation, or\u2014yeah, like basically blame myself for everything. So I think it\u2019s a way of putting the blame back on myself. [12:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right, but if someone is to blame, yourself or anybody else, that implies that things could have been different or things could have been controlled. Versus like, no, there\u2019s no one to blame, it is what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What kinds of behaviors has he said gives him reservation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: So a lot of it has had to do with me being so down, and down on myself. So a lot of it has to do with, you know, coming in the door and immediately being negative about something that happened during the day. Or, you know, not being able to accept compliments, or like looking at myself and saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">negative things. So it\u2019s a lot of very negative behaviors that I\u2019ve had because I don\u2019t feel\u2014I think don\u2019t feel good about myself, or can\u2019t always be very positive. And so that\u2019s pretty much all of it. You know, he would say like he\u2019ll come in the door from work, \u201cand instead of saying something positive <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">you always have something negative to say or a complaint.\u201d Or, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re just being so critical of yourself and putting yourself down and doing all this stuff.\u201d And by me acting that way he says that it puts him in like a dark or more depressed\u2014just not like a very happy place basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And when he said that to you how do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I mean, I feel like\u2014in a way I was glad that he pointed out certain things. Like, I mean, like coming in the door and being really negative, it\u2019s something that you can just sort of be conscious of and just think like, no, you know like. So in a way it was good because it helped me to be more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">reflective, but in other ways I felt like, well, you\u2019re supposed to kind of be there for me and help me through this and be understanding that I\u2019m having a difficult time, and it\u2019s hard that\u2014it\u2019s a lot of pressure to have to be up all the time to keep someone else up, even if maybe you\u2019re just really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">not feeling great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I would think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: I mean, I would think so. If you\u2019re having a hard time and your boyfriend says, \u201cYou\u2019re really a downer for having a hard time. Can you not have a hard time?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: I know I\u2019m [overtalk].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: No, but it\u2019s\u2014yeah, but it\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Or a little bit maybe exaggerated.

No, but it\u2019s a lot of responsibility to feel like your mood is going to determine the other person\u2019s mood. And I have been in\u2014I\u2019ve had more prolonged good moods I think since leaving my job, but there are still these times that I get into this darker place. And so it\u2019s really stressful <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">to think like, if I don\u2019t bring myself out of this dark place then there goes all these months of positive feelings and we\u2019re back to square one with the negative feelings, and now I have to wait another year to get\u2014 Like so that\u2019s sort of how I feel like I can\u2019t have these bad periods, because then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">it just tacks on more time. So it\u2019s a lot of pressure I guess to try to hide when I\u2019m not feeling great, but it\u2019s kind of hard to do when you live with someone, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: I would imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Are there times where he soothes you or makes you feel better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, but I think that he tries to. But also sometimes if I\u2019m really being down he kind of walks away because he doesn\u2019t know what to do. More out of frustration. Like he\u2019ll say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do when you feel like this, I don\u2019t know.\u201d You know, kind of like throw your hands <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">up, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d So I think also because if I\u2019m crying he doesn\u2019t like to see me cry, it\u2019s too hard for him, and I think he doesn\u2019t know how to handle it really. Yeah. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of things he would do to comfort me more out of frustration than anything else I guess. [sic]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: What parts of your relationship work? Because this sounds like a part of your relationship that doesn\u2019t work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: This is just, yeah, one part that doesn\u2019t work. But then in general I would say everything else works. Like we have, you know, great conversation, we\u2019re really on the same page about traveling and doing different things together, and we have a lot of fun together, and when we\u2019re just having, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">you know, down time or cuddling and stuff like that, that\u2019s really good. So when we are doing more of that stuff it\u2019s really, really positive, and we\u2019re in synch about how we feel about a lot of things. [18:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">But the one area that we\u2019re really not is just I guess me being down and my relationship with myself. And then the ideas about marriage. Because I believe in God and he doesn\u2019t, and so the one area where that really comes into play is with marriage stuff, because he feels like you should just do it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">legally to have kids, and I feel like it\u2019s a little bit more than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well, you would think you could not believe in God and still think that marriage is beyond a legal contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that he thinks it\u2019s a religious institution. So that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think\u2014he says that, you know, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be with you if I didn\u2019t love you. And by being with you in this relationship, to me that\u2019s how we show our commitment to each other.\u201d And, I mean, his dad\u2019s been married <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">three times, so I understand where some of these reservations and some of these things are coming from. And his mom almost split up with her long-time partner a few years ago. There\u2019s a lot of things that are telling him that marriage doesn\u2019t work out I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: [sneezes] Excuse me, I\u2019m just getting over a cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Sorry about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s okay. So yeah, I think there\u2019s a lot of signals and different things that are telling him that marriage doesn\u2019t work. And with his dad\u2019s second wife, she kind of raised him, and she went into some kind of depression sort of crisis with herself and that\u2019s what led to their divorce, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">and that really affected him. And I think part of him is saying well, if you\u2019re doing this now, what are you going to do when you\u2019re older, like what\u2019s going to happen? So I think that\u2019s a lot of it. But it\u2019s still hard for me to feel like it\u2019s all me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well, I can certainly help you frame that part differently. I mean, of course it\u2019s not all you, it\u2019s about how your moods make him feel, and what he can and can\u2019t do. So it\u2019s a dynamic between the two of you, it\u2019s not your fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: But it sort of feeds into your feeling that it\u2019s your fault. And I guess if it\u2019s your fault it\u2019s also maybe within your control, versus your moods and how he can and can\u2019t manage them. There\u2019s really no reason that someone\u2019s mood necessarily affects another person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I mean, that\u2019s not inevitable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Something\u2019s going on inside of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I mean, he cares about you obviously\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Mm hm. [21:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: \u2014but for those moods to be overwhelming and for him to feel like, \u201cWell, you just can\u2019t feel that way,\u201d something is going on inside of him that he\u2019s struggling with as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Oh yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And maybe you know that logically, but I guess emotionally it doesn\u2019t feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Well, I definitely know that there are things going on inside of him that I\u2019m sure he was affected by different things that happened in his childhood and has never really addressed them. So I know that a lot of actions or the things that he\u2019s doing may be because of that, but he\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">willing to\u2014you know, he says that his stance on marriage has nothing to do with his parents. So if someone isn\u2019t willing to acknowledge that certain things might be affecting their behavior, or like they might have something going on, then you kind of just put it all on yourself. Because that\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B52\">only thing that I feel like I can change, is me. And I feel like I can\u2019t change a lot about his view of the world, because it is what it is. And in a lot of ways his view of the world works with mine and it\u2019s fine, and it\u2019s just this one area. And I don\u2019t want to think that I can change him, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B53\">I know that I can\u2019t. So I think that\u2019s why I just keep looking at myself to figure out what I can change to make things work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: That still doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all your fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I feel like there\u2019s a big difference between sort of recognizing your partner\u2019s limitations and realizing that if some dynamic is going to change you may need to be the one that makes the difference. Versus, well, this is all my fault\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. [23:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: \u2014which is a very different kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like those things get lumped together for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah, I mean, in almost every situation I think that things are my fault. So, you know, even in a work situation or anything I\u2019m very overly critical of myself because I\u2019m always willing to take the blame or think that something\u2019s my fault, or think that I could have done something better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Like if only?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah, there is a lot, there is a lot of that. But, I mean, that feeds into my weight and everything. Because I think, if only I hadn\u2019t gained those first 10 lbs. then it wouldn\u2019t have kept happening and then I wouldn\u2019t be here. Or if only I hadn\u2019t eaten cheeseburgers in college this wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">have happened. So there is a lot of those kind of thoughts. Like I know that I need to move forward and deal with what\u2019s already happened, but there is a lot of I could have done this better and then none of this would have happened, and then everything would be better and I would be more of this ideal <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C92\">person that I\u2014or I would be just as good as everybody else is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a term for it in the field which has a very\u2014a pejorative term, but it\u2019s called pathologic regret.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a very\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Makes sense, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: It makes sense. It\u2019s a very pejorative term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: But this is\u2014the sentiment is just like\u2014in a sense like living in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Which is hard to kind of\u2014there\u2019s a feeling that you get of control over things, and I guess there\u2019s a hopeful aspect of it in that sense, but it\u2019s really kind of a position of despair. Like any change that could have happened you, you know, missed the boat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: So there\u2019s not like a forward looking \u201clet me see all the things that could be ahead of me that are really good.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah. And I think I\u2019m trying to look forward in terms of career and all of that, but I think that in terms of like marriage and stuff I sort of have turned that off and stopped myself from looking forward, because I feel like that leads to disappointment. So there was a time where I would, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">you know, picture all this stuff, and plan different things, and now I just try to shut if off because I feel like it\u2019ll almost like get my hopes up in terms of that. [26:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">And then in terms of weight stuff, I try to look ahead, but then every time I come to a point where when I was looking ahead I should have already lost 10 lbs., or I should have done something. Then it\u2019s sort of like, well, obviously it\u2019s not going to happen, I shouldn\u2019t set goals or look ahead or be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">optimistic about my weight because it\u2019s not going to change, and if anything it\u2019s going to get worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Kind of this catastrophic\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: \u2014like it can only get worse, it can\u2019t get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Mm hm.

[27:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, so\u2026 Yeah, I just want to like move past all of this negativity, and just I want to try to put all of those thoughts that I have, like sort of reverse them or turn them around, because it can ruin days at a time when I\u2019m feeling so horribly about myself. And then the other thing too is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">a lot of times when I do feel badly about myself I will put on a little bit of weight. And I weigh myself a lot. And so I feel like seeing a bad number on the scale makes it even worse, like it triggers those thoughts even more. Whereas seeing a good number on the scale makes you feel more elated or happier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">Because I actually did go through a period where I tried not to weigh myself, because I felt like my mood was really tied to weight. But then during that period I actually gained weight because I wasn\u2019t keeping track of it. So I need to work on finding the happy medium between, you know, weighing yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">for medical reasons, or just to keep track of it, and having your whole mood be tied to what\u2019s on the scale. Because that definitely brings me like way down, and it makes me really, really critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: And do you gain weight when you feel badly, or are you just eating more like to comfort yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Probably. Certainly I don\u2019t think about food as much or in such a negative way when I\u2019m feeling better. And like I noticed on Saturday, we were out for Mexican food and I was like\u2014the chip basket. Like just that comfort because I was feeling so upset. So I think I sort of get completely out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">of control with everything. So I think it includes food, but it also just includes feeling like everything in my life is not in my control. So I get into a place where I\u2019m not as aware of what I\u2019m doing almost. So I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening more with the food and the overeating when I\u2019m feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201052\">down, because I\u2019m almost shutting off the awareness portion of my brain and I\u2019m just not even paying attention to what I\u2019m doing really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: One thing\u2014I can\u2019t remember if we talked about this last time, in terms of medication, if you\u2019ve ever been any anti-depressants or any [inaudible].

But in the last year or so I\u2019ve thought about this more and more, about med\u2014yeah, almost about medication as sort of treated\u2014taking medication as you would a medical illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Not to say that I think you\u2019re ill by any means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re depressed. You definitely have\u2014 And so I don\u2019t like to see that untreated. I think psychotherapy is wonderful, and I think we could do a lot of work together, but I worry about this not getting treated and in a sense delaying your progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: So I do want to put that out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: Does the medication make you gain weight? Because a lot of my friends have gained a lot of weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I figured that that would be one of the things that you would ask. And really I don\u2019t like to talk too much about the specific medications because that\u2019s why I refer someone to a consult, because it\u2019s really not my area of expertise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019m happy to answer some of the questions. But, you know, I\u2019m not a physician.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s first of all not\u2014there\u2019s medication\u2014like SSRIs, which a lot of people are on, Celexa, Prozac and so forth, people do gain weight. There are anti-depressants where people don\u2019t gain weight. So it depends on the anti-depressant. The other thing is, when people feel less depressed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">they often\u2014they can lose weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: If they\u2019re feeling less depressed. So some medications do have the side effect of weight gain, but not all medications do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: Mm hm, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s not\u2014that wouldn\u2019t be inevitable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: Mm hm. And do you feel like when someone\u2019s on them they have to be on them forever though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">CLIENT: Okay. I just don\u2019t\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">THERAPIST: Well, that would be your concern?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just don\u2019t want to have to be taking something forever. I want to be able to do this on my own and like come out of it sort of on my own and not have to rely on something else I guess for a really prolonged period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: What does \u201con your own\u201d mean? [33:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: I guess like I want to be able to have different practices or different\u2014change my way of thinking. Or maybe like have more of a schedule, or keep\u2014I don\u2019t know. I just want to be able to use different techniques that aren\u2019t medicine and be able to I think practice those techniques forever I guess. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201491\">And have that be something that I\u2019m doing or that I\u2019ve changed or that I\u2019ve developed or fine tuned, rather than just taking medication forever I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m pushing medication on you at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: No, no, no. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: But it seems\u2014like my thought in terms of what you were saying for that, and it really relates to one of the things you talk about, not everything is under our control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: We have brain chemistry that is what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20152-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20152-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not always under our control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah, that\u2019s true. Because part of me does feel like there\u2019s something going on with my brain chemistry. Because to suddenly just be able to feel so sad and so down like so quickly is kind of crazy, and to really have trouble bringing yourself back out of it. Like I don\u2019t\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201591\">think that\u2019s the norm. I definitely have more highs than\u2014a lot of highs and a lot of lows, and there\u2019s not a lot of evenness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: I mean, I will also say, it\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t\u2014I will also say, first of all, people are certainly not on medication\u2014I mean, I guess some people like to take it forever, but you\u2019re not signing up for something for life. But I will say that when people feel a little bit better they\u2019re more likely <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B1\">to change how they think about things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: Mm hm. That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Then when you\u2019re just feeling so badly it is much\u2014it\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s much harder to get out of those thought patterns because it\u2019s so self-reinforcing. When you\u2019re feeling badly it\u2019s very hard to think differently, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: And so\u2014and I think part of the suggestion is coming from a place that I actually think that you\u2019d\u2014it would help you get to where you\u2019re going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: Mm hm, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: That it would be sort of a vehicle for that and not just sort of a crutch, or a place\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: \u2014where you were actually doing things differently in your life.

As you say, a different relationship to food and a different relationship to yourself and to the people around you, which are all related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: So yeah, I mean, I just encourage you to think about it.

That would be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">THERAPIST: So yeah, I could definitely\u2014let me see if she has\u2014if you\u2019re interested I\u2019ll\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s in Cambridge as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: And I will check to see about her availability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">CLIENT: Okay.

And so I think for me mentally I know that when I\u2019m having these really down periods, and I don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B51\">want to do anything, and I can\u2019t get myself together to do my school work or do different things, I know that that\u2019s depression, but I don\u2019t want to acknowledge it, because I feel like that\u2019s just another thing that\u2019s wrong with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">THERAPIST: A personal defect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">CLIENT: Mm hm, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Which just feeds the cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Yeah. And she actually sent me a card this week with a poem about Weight Watchers in it. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DF\">THERAPIST: That she wrote? [39:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E1\">CLIENT: No, it was like one of her coworkers wrote a poem about counting points and Weight Watchers and she thought it was cute. And then I got a card from her that was saying, you know, \u201cGood luck with your exams in school,\u201d and stuff, and then inside was this poem about Weight Watchers that she had\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E11\">So yeah, there\u2019s definitely a lot of stuff there. I mean, I know that that\u2019s where it came from. But then I feel like, well, I\u2019m not around them all the time, and I\u2019m not in that environment, why can\u2019t I just, you know, get out of it on my own or\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Right.

Yeah, I mean, I think that\u2019s part of my personality is that I\u2019m always\u2014I\u2019m always naturally kind of\u2014I apologize all the time, and I\u2019m always thinking that I\u2019m to blame for everything that\u2019s going on, or that I\u2019m just not good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Did your mom feel that way about herself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E9\">CLIENT: She definitely tries to do it all, to the point of getting very, very, very overwhelmed. Like she found out earlier this summer that she had breast cancer, but it\u2019s the stage zero, so they just kinda took it out and different things. But she still kept going and trying to help everyone and do <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E91\">all this stuff without taking care of herself or acknowledging that she might need time to rest. So I feel like maybe the fact that she keeps trying to do it all\u2014and I\u2014it kind of reminds of the same thing\u2014is sort of a sign that she feels like she\u2019s responsible for a lot and she needs to be in control <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E92\">of it, and if she doesn\u2019t do it no one else will. I mean, I definitely think we have very similar feelings in regards to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB\">Like if I\u2014she\u2019s always cleaning her house before people come over, and I do the same thing. Like if it\u2019s not clean then they\u2019ll judge me. Or, you know, she\u2019s always trying to help other people with stuff, and I\u2019ll do that too, because if I don\u2019t then who am I if I\u2019m not someone to always be helping <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB1\">people, and always be going above and beyond. So I think that\u2019s a lot of her identity, and it might come from needing to, you know, be in control of different situations. But I mean, we are similar sort of in that kind of way, but\u2026 [42:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201ED\">THERAPIST: I imagine with the cleaning the house that it can have like the symbolic meaning of someone coming inside and seeing that not everything is tidy or straight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. And my mom used to\u2014when she would come to visit me when I first had an apartment here she would come, and I would have just cleaned the bathroom, but she would clean my bathroom. So in a way of trying to help I guess. But I think that\u2019s also a little bit of a trigger. So now I feel like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF1\">well, there\u2019s a speck here, and someone\u2019s going to see it when they come in and they\u2019re going to think that that\u2019s disgusting. So I think a lot of that is coming from her probably. Because I definitely freak out before I have people over and want to have everything presented a certain way, because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF2\">feel like it\u2019s a reflection of me and everything needs to be perfect, and if it\u2019s not perfect then they\u2019ll know that I\u2019m not perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">THERAPIST: It just sounds so stressful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is. Yeah. And that\u2019s\u2014I definitely freak\u2014like for a while my boyfriend didn\u2019t even want us to have people over because I was freaking out so badly. And now I try to plan more in advance so it\u2019s not as chaotic, but I still kind of have that I want everything to be a certain way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">THERAPIST: What came to my mind is like almost this level of equivalence. Like your mom thinks, you know, you\u2019re her and she\u2019s you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019re the bathroom and the bathroom is you. Like there\u2019s sort of like a very strong identification with people and things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, there is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">THERAPIST: Like your home. I mean, I guess there\u2019s some loose\u2014you know, your home maybe is a reflection of you to some extent. [44:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">THERAPIST: It reflects your style. But there seems like such an equivalence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that\u2019s like\u2014I mean, growing up before we would have people over like she would always make us\u2014my sister and I\u2014help her clean, and she was always running around freaking out. And then I notice myself having similar freak outs and it\u2019s kind of scary, because I don\u2019t know how it happened. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202031\">But she would always want\u2014you know, this needs to get done, and you have to polish the furniture and do this and that and everything. So I think maybe her feelings on that, somehow just growing up with that I just sort of took those on, or decided that that\u2019s what you need to do before people come to your house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">THERAPIST: Well, there\u2019s certainly the issue of exposure, that that\u2019s what you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">THERAPIST: Or have seen. And then there\u2019s the issue of sort of always being told that the two of you are so similar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">THERAPIST: And all that you take in based on that sort of repeated, you know, enforcements of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2020C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561382\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">THERAPIST: But I think that\u2019s very strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20215\">THERAPIST: As much as like you do not want to be identical probably to anybody, especially your mom you know has her own struggles\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20217\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20219\">THERAPIST: \u2014that don\u2019t look very appealing to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B\">CLIENT: No. And that\u2019s a lot of it too, is like I don\u2019t want to become the person that is never taking time for myself, or just constantly in this chaotic state kind of, and just trying to do all this stuff for other people, and then not even addressing my own issues. Like I don\u2019t want that to be me <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B1\">at all. So there are a lot of aspects of obviously her behavior and the stuff she\u2019s doing that I just really don\u2019t want to be me. But what I had always taken as a positive was, \u201cOh, she does all this stuff, she volunteers and she tries to help other people,\u201d and so that\u2019s who I am and I\u2019m going to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B2\">to help other people and do all this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">But a lot of times I\u2019m doing those things almost begrudgingly. Like sometimes I don\u2019t even want to be doing them because I don\u2019t have time necessarily. And so I think sometimes I\u2019m overbooking myself basically, just because I\u2019m trying to keep up this appearance that I can do it all and that I\u2019m\u2014you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D1\">know, my house is clean, I\u2019m cooking all this stuff when people come over, I can volunteer and go to school and just do all these different things. And somehow I think that doing all of that at least puts me like a little higher. But then it\u2019s like the one bad thing is that I\u2019m not engaged. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D2\">I\u2019m fat, and then I don\u2019t look good. Like then there\u2019s all these other things.
