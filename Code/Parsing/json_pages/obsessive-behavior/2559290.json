We went away with friends over the weekend and then decided not to leave until Saturday morning, because we wanted to stay one more night; but we were on the ferry at 7:15 this morning. But we're here on time. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: .I'm not showering so sorry. (both laugh) But we made it, so that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It's an informal meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yes, that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: And you look like you got some sun?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: A little bit, yeah. I had myself so covered, but I still got a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: That's okay. You need a little Vitamin D.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Vitamin D, yeah. But I feel like I'm coming off of a whirlwind of the past couple of weeks. Part of me was so tired going this weekend. It was kind of like the last thing I wanted to do, but we were going with good friends. It actually ended up being really relaxing, so it was nice. I'm really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">glad that we did it. But I remember thinking Saturday morning, \"I really feel like I just want to stay home. (chuckles) It would be nice to just relax,\" but it ended up being really nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So where have you been, in addition?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: The ALA In Situ is a big conference. It's kind of neat because it's like the blending of my two worlds. People from MARAC, where I used to work, and Ryan, who was my professor, they hold an institute with Brown; so it's kind of like in collaboration every summer around this idea of ALA. I've <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">been a facilitator in the past, but I didn't do it last year because I had just had Trae. It's always a really intense week. They're just really long days. We had about 150 participants and you lead a group. You're kind of facilitating. Districts send teams, so I was in charge of kind of supporting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">this one team from Vermont. I kind of just forgot how intense the work was, and it's totally different now that Trae is here, too. I'm just not used to spending such long days away from him, so it just felt exhausting and it was hard on Todd, too. I needed to be at the institute before we could even <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">drop Trae off at daycare and he needed to pick him up because I wasn't home early enough to get him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: So he was really pulling all of that weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it just felt like a crazy week; but kind of a nice reminder that I'm really lucky that I don't have a job that demands that every single week. That's good. It was just harder. Most nights I was getting home at 6:00 or 6:30 even and that was right when we were giving Trae dinner, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">I just felt like it was this whirlwind of a week. We were all so tired. I kind of felt like the last thing you want to do is go away again. And then the weekend before, for the Fourth of July, we had been up in Canada. We kind of split the time with our families, so we spent a couple of nights with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">Todd's family at the cottage and then one night with my family in Portland, Canada. That was really fun to see everybody, but Trae didn't sleep that well so we were so tired going into it.  Then I had a meeting for the facilitators on Sunday night, just to get everything ready. The meeting started at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">5:00 right down here, and so we left. Usually it takes like an hour and a half, and we left. We gave ourselves more than three hours and we just got here. So I had come off the beach, I hadn't showered again. (both laugh) This was a little different; it was a little more formal.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: You were sort of in your work mode.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like that kind of started the week off in that pace of running from the next thing. I felt like I was trying to be extra aware of things that might make me anxious because I already felt like I was at this heightened state of running around.  It felt good; I think I was also <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">kind of thinking back to when I did do it two years ago and remembering that there were little things that were making me anxious the last time I did it. I think it actually was right around the time I started seeing you, that same time period. At the end the group shares. We call it a sharatorium, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">which is this silly term that they make up, but I felt like I hadn't told my group ahead of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You remembered then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I was extra aware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You were worried about that last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, making sure that I was not going to do anything to get myself anxious, just because I knew. I felt myself kind of keyed up about the whole thing anyway. I felt like I did kind of do a good job of trying to manage that, even though it did feel so stressful. There was just one night we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">had Monday and Todd's parents stayed with us Monday night because they were going to watch Trae for us on Tuesday and so I was driving myself home on Monday and Todd was so tired, too.  We stayed up late because his parents didn't get to us until late. I just kind of had a feeling. I think I almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">talked myself into it by thinking, \"I haven't had any second to just sit,\" because it took us a while to get Trae down for bed and we didn't eat dinner until really late. His parents came while we were still eating dinner and then we went to bed, so I just felt like I kind of set myself up for having <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">a hard night sleeping. And it was funny because I think I was tossing and turning in bed, but I was asleep. Todd rubbed my back and he was like, \"It's all right. Just get back to sleep,\" but that woke me up. (both laugh) So we were joking because I was like, \"Why did you rub my back? It woke me up.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200314\">From that I had a hard time getting back to sleep, but I think I was just so tired that I fell right to sleep at first and I just wasn't . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you were exhausted from the schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it was kind of nice, then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And after that one night, that didn't repeat itself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It was okay. I was a little worried about it the following night just worrying about it, thinking, \"Oh, my gosh. I'm so tired and this schedule does not allow me to be totally exhausted. I hope I can sleep tonight.\" But I think I was just so tired that I was okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And one night doesn't necessarily impact the next in the way that it had when you were having repeated trouble falling asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: And there was one night when I woke up in the middle of the night, but I just went to the bathroom. I didn't want to let myself start thinking about it, and I was able to get back to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Good for you. Having weeks that are different like this and being able to manage the interruptions of sleep or different expectations or flow to your day, shows how much more resilient you are now. The routine doesn't need to be as carefully monitored; it's not as fragile. You can handle <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">these differences. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: And it's still felt like a very stressful week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Did it feel like a stressful week or were you anxious about the week? Is that different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I think when I'm anxious I physically feel it, I feel like I don't know like I have too much energy in me or something, but when I'm stressed out about something I don't really have that same physical feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: It sounds like your week was the latter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You were running from one thing to the next and it was busy, but it doesn't sound like you were worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. I think at the beginning of the week I did feel anxious just because I didn't sleep that first night, but then it kind of went away. But I do feel like I was extra on alert. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You were cognizant. You were looking for things that you might need to take care of to be okay. You smoothed the way for yourself, like making sure you probably told your group about the share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Right, I did. On the very first . . . I had it written down to make sure to tell them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: You were kind of smoothing the way for yourself, like having a heads up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Right. And I think I was picking up on the little things that I know I didn't need to worry about, but I was able to let them go, I think, because I was just in that extra alert mode that I became aware of them, where I don't think I would have really been aware of them otherwise. On the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">hand, too, it was such a good week. That's why I really enjoy doing it. It's really neat to see 150 people who are so excited about ALA. The whole thing that we help them to do is to create an plan so when they get back to their district they can share.  It actually was a nice time for me. I had just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">finished collecting data and I had two weeks of starting to work with it and then had this. At first I was like, \"The timing stinks because it's breaking my momentum,\" but it was almost a nice reminder that this is what it's all about. I'm definitely not regretful that I did it either. I think it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200553\">good for me and that's a nice networking thing to meet teachers and to work with people from MARAC again, so it worked out well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: It keeps you in the community. It's a way of keeping you from being isolated. One of the things we talked about last time is that you're moving into this phase of working with your data. There's such a difference between interacting with people every day, to being at your office or at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">library or at coffee shop working with your material.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Right, just by myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Having a chance to really be with your peers for the week and do that intensity. Now you can go hang out in your office by yourself on the computer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I know. Now I'm like really looking forward to this week. I'm like, \"Oh, I can't wait to be by myself and just look through all the data.\" It was a good reminder, I think, and then a reminder, too, that I am so lucky. Usually my schedule is so flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Right. You can arrange to be home for dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That just really reminded me. It was the same kind of feeling like when I started collecting data and at the beginning doing both classes those were really long days, too. It was another nice reminder to just take advantage of the flexibility that I have. It's still a lot of work; <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">but it's not like there's a boss making sure I'm coming in on time or whatever, so that's nice, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: How does Trae do with the difference? You said he was having some trouble sleeping with the travel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that was, I think, mostly because it was Fourth of July, too, and there were all these fireworks going off. We were laughing. Now Fourth of July has a whole new meaning as parents. I hate Fourth of July. It's terrible because I think last year he was still so little and it didn't really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">matter. So that's what kind of threw him off. But usually he's pretty good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: That's a tough holiday for babies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I never would have even thought of it in that way; although now just dropping him off . . . We came straight from Canada and dropped him off and then I grabbed my backpack and we came back in and I dropped him off and he started crying when I left. That hardly ever happens and it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">usually because Todd does the morning drop-offs because he has the car. But usually when I do, he's usually fine; but I think it's because he had been with us all weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: He wasn't used to going to . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he fell asleep in the car so we woke him up before we got there, but I knew he was going to be sleepy. That just makes me feel awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: He doesn't know that it's a Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. I didn't feel like it was, either. We were worried we were just going to feel like it was still the weekend. So usually he does fine, though; but I feel like that's really hard to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: It's a hard goodbye for both of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yes. I think that happens very rarely. We know he's still happy there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yes. I'm sure he's fine by now. It's a hard way to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it does just feel like it's been kind of a long stretch. I was wondering about that, too, and how I would think about that, having it be a longer stretch. We usually go two weeks and it was three weeks; and I had trouble sleeping right after I had seen you and I remember thinking to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">myself, \"Oh, no. Is this going to be bad that we're going a longer time?\"  I also didn't really like the fact I didn't want to feel like it had to be two weeks. I know we'd gone longer stretches before, so in a way, I was like, \"This is good. I can just kind of see how I do.\" Like if I had this kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200792\">of night early on . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: How to correct it yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yes. So I think it was a good test for me, too, to try and get through that myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: You noticed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. There have been a few nights in this stretch that have just been a little bit harder. I think it is all just in my head, too. Usually there are nights when something is on my mind that is keeping me up, especially during the institute. When Todd woke me up by accident, then it was more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">like, \"Oh, I hope I can get back to sleep.\" Then when it happened again, I was like, \"Oh, he woke me up before and I couldn't get back to sleep. I hope I can now.\" It wasn't really a worry. It was more just like worrying about sleep. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: You put that question in your mind of whether or not you'd be able to fall back asleep, rather than knowing that if you get woken up, you fall back asleep, letting yourself trust that waking up and falling back asleep can be part of the night sometimes. Maybe that's part of, not normal sleep, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">but somewhat typical, that there are nights you're going to be woken up, whether it's your partner rolling over or you needing to go to the bathroom or Trae waking up. You're starting to really trust that you will go back to sleep rather than questioning it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: I know, and I think I was better the second time when it happened. I just got up and went to the bathroom so I knew I wouldn't just lay in bed thinking about it, and that seemed to help, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah, rather than getting that circle going. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. So we'll see. It was nice to have so many weeks of not really having any trouble sleeping. I feel like it has crept in a little bit, but I also feel like it's been very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you haven't been in your typical pattern. You had the switch from collecting data to doing your own thing, traveling places, the holiday, the conference there's been a lot of inconsistency. With all of that, having a couple of nights here and there is pretty good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: And you were okay. Even on days you were really tired, you were really okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: And it is, I feel like Trae's been getting up. He's had a stretch of just up really early in the mornings, so that's been kind of good a reminder that, \"Well, you can still get through the day, even when you're up at 5:30. (laughing) It's okay.\" So that's good, too, to just know that I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">have to have a certain number of hours of sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: You're not quite as fragile as you think you are. You're actually a lot more resilient than you give yourself credit for, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I tried Pilates, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Oh? That was on the list?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes. Tried breaking my rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: How was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Actually, I loved the class that I did. It was really fun. I got the membership and started the class one week, but then the next week was that institute so I've only been there twice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well that was part of the rule, too, right? It didn't necessarily have to become something that you did every time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it was really fun. The first class that I went to I really liked the instructor. There were two instructors there. The second one said she taught a class on Wednesday, so I went back on Wednesday, but she had a substitute and I didn't really like that class as much. I am going to try <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">to get back to that class that I did like, so it was nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: When opportunity presents itself, so is that it? The challenge now is to continue to let it be something that, if it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't. There's not necessarily this obligation to fulfill a new [rule] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, that I have to get there. I think that will be good to not have it be this thing that I have to do. I'll see how that works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: See if you can let it remain somewhat flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yes. And already I was thinking, because I had no idea what I was doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You shouldn't the first class. You shouldn't have to know what you are doing. What was it like to let yourself be the newbie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: That was okay. It felt fine. They were really good, the instructors, saying, \"You're not going to have any idea what you're doing, but if you come, it usually starts to click for people once they come after three classes.\" That was kind of like I want to make sure I at least get to three early <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">on, just so I can get the hang of it. But then I think, \"That's not really going to happen,\" because then I wasn't there last week. But it's just fun to try. Everyone there was really nice, saying that they had no idea what they were doing, too, when they first started it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Good for you for letting yourself get to something new and to keep it flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, it felt good and it was fun just to try it out. There were different times; there is a 4:30 one, so that was kind of like a nice compromise. I felt like I ended my day a little bit earlier than usual, but it wasn't taking a huge chunk out of my day. I usually would make sure I was home <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">around 5:00 anyway. I tried one that's at noon, too, just to see how that felt, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And how was the difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: It was okay. I was thinking it is taking a big chunk out of my day; by the time I get over there, change, go to the class, and then get back to the library. I also feel like in the mornings I could just be better about my time.  The way we have it now, Todd brings Trae to get to day care at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">8:00 and then once they leave, I usually take a shower and go to school. I was just saying to Todd that I feel being more efficient in the morning and trying to leave with them, too, because then by the time I get the bus, I'm not really to school until 9:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Are you still nursing in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So that makes it a little bit harder to get up and shower before he's out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. That did feel like I didn't really get that much done and I didn't really have . . . finally getting to school. I was thinking I can try making sure I leave the house when they do and see how that feels, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: What would you have to give up to be able to do that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: I think just sleep (laughs) because then I can just set the alarm to make sure I'm up. If Trae sleeps in late, which he's not been doing lately, we would kind of let ourselves sleep and then just get him ready and they would go. I also think I can see him starting to be finished with nursing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">in the morning, too, and I think that would give us extra time. He's so funny. I never would have guessed that we still would be nursing. There have been a couple of mornings in a row where he hasn't been that interested and then the other morning we were trying to leave and I had to just pull him off. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C12\">I was like, \"We need to go. We've been doing this for 20 minutes. This is a long time.\" So he's definitely surprised me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: How did he do with that when you had to pull him off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: He was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: So that's sort of another thing, like another rule to challenge. Maybe he doesn't always need to be the one that decides exactly how long he nurses. If there's a limit, there's a limit. He adjusted. He was okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, he was fine. It's kind of funny. At this point, I don't even feel like I'm making any more milk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: It may be for comfort or routine and if that's okay with both of you, that's okay. There's no rule, but it also gives you permission to be like, \"Okay. You got your 10 minutes of snuggling and your bonding time, now we need to go to school or day care.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Now we need to get going. Yeah. So he's very flexible with that, for the most part. He's never been one that really, really wants to nurse. It's funny that he's still, at least, showing signs that he still wants to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: You have really wanted to follow his cues, and there may be times when you can do that. You have room for him to sort of be the lead on that. And there may be times when you have to follow something else instead of his cue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, so now it's nice to just kind of see how it goes. Now it just feels so nice to have this time of no pressure with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: It's really, really a nice way however long this phase lasts it's a nice way to end without your feeling so pressured and frought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, and we were with friends right now that have three little girls. One is only seven months so my friend is nursing her now. We were just talking about it. She could just nurse her all the kids were playing on the floor with Legos and she was just sitting there nursing. Wow. That's very <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">good. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Plus her third kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: That's exactly what she said. \"This will be very different when you have a second.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And every kid is different, too. Yes, she's got that experience of having lots of experience nursing, it sounds like; but also every kid's personality is different. Some kids latch pretty easy; some kids don't. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: Right. So it was funny to just relive that part, too. We get ready to go and she's like, \"Okay, I'm just going to nurse and then I'll be ready.\" I was like, \"You take your time. I know how that is.\" (laughs) That was fun, though, to be reminded of how hard it was but now it's nice to just be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">enjoying this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that you're in a different part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, so we'll see where he decides to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: One of your strengths is really being able to keep those kinds of perspectives. You're able to step back and look at things and appreciate where you are. I think it's a really nice skill that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Especially after knowing how hard it was. Now I feel like I really want to appreciate. Todd feels the same way. He's like, \"It's so nice to know you're in there nursing and I don't have to worry like, 'Are they doing okay? Should I go in? Am I hearing you make a noise?'\" So it's a nice phase <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">for both of us, too, because I know it's stressed Todd, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Also because you're also much more relaxed about it. It was such a big focal point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. We're actually going to go away, just the two of us, because Todd kept mentioning, \"It would be so nice just to do an overnight.\" So for Father's Day I kept telling myself, \"Okay. I'm going to make a reservation so that we can go away just for a night.\" My parents are in Newport, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">which is kind of on the border of Rhode Island. My mom had suggested Providence because it's maybe half an hour from my parents and he could stay with my parents. All the month leading up to Father's day I knew I wanted to do this and I was thinking of every excuse not to call and make a reservation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E92\">I was like, \"Oh, I'll wait until Trae goes down for a nap,\" and then he would be down' for a nap and I'd think, \"Oh, maybe I'll wake him up if I'm on the phone.\" I was just thinking of all . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: What were you hedging against there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: I think I knew that I wanted to do it and I knew Todd really wanted a night away. I felt like that would be a great Father's Day present for him and I felt like it would be really good for me to do; but I just didn't feel like totally ready to do it, I think. I was just kind of laughing to myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">because I really was just putting it off and putting it off. Then I came home one day and my mom was watching Trae. She knew my plan because we had figured out a date that would work weeks ago. She was like, \"Why haven't you made that reservation yet? I'm here; you go and make the phone call and do <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED2\">it. I'm not going to leave until you make the call.\" I think that's so funny because my mom hardly ever left us ever when we were little. With my sister, I think I remember when they went. She was like four or five the first time she did a night away, so it was good for her to kind of say to me, \"You <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED3\">know what? You really need to do this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: You felt like you really had permission. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I did call and we made the reservation. Todd keeps joking, \"I have a feeling we'll probably drop Trae off at 7:00 at night.\" (laughs) No. I said, \"I can handle 24 hours. It will be good.\" That's coming up, not this weekend, but next weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: How do you feel about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: I feel really mixed and I'm wondering how I'll feel next week, anticipating the weekend. Part of me feels really excited. It will be fun. We actually got a gift certificate for our wedding or something crazy that we never used for a place in Providence, so we won't have to pay for dinner. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">can go out and just have a night, just the two of us. I feel like I'm really looking forward to it, but then when I think about . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You're lucky the restaurant still exists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: I know. (both laugh) I went online and made sure that it did. To think of anyone who I would leave him with right now, it would only be my mom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but they have lots of time together. She [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:02).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">CLIENT: I don't have a worry at all about him and how he'll be, I just worry about me missing him, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">THERAPIST: And you might; and that's okay. You can miss him and enjoy having time where you really get to focus on each other without the responsibility of Trae at the same time. The two feelings don't have to take away from each other. They can both be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">CLIENT: I think it will just be dropping him off. Going up to my parents' and dropping him off will be the hardest part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">THERAPIST: The anticipation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: I feel like as soon as we are in the car and on the way it will be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">THERAPIST: Give yourself a little transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">CLIENT: That's just one thing. I've always had trouble even when Todd goes away I'll cry. I'll be laughing because I'm crying, but I always just feel like that part is hard for me to do, I think, so we'll see. I feel like the more I put it off the more I'll build it in my head of being this huge deal, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201091\">too, so I think it's good to do it early when it's so easy where, if anything did happen, we're so close; and to have him with my mom is good. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: It doesn't need to be a [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:17) thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: Right. So we'll see. I feel like that will be a good first step for us to try. I still will feel very mixed about it, but it will be more leaning towards the positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Well I'll be very interested to hear how it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: I was looking online to find good picnic spots. It was fun to kind of plan it all out and it's fun to have something to look forward to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: Kind of take on your wife role rather than your mother role or your professional role; to actually be able to devote a little space and planning and thinking of your wife role. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. And I feel like that's the role that sometimes is the hardest one to fulfill when you have to prioritize; the mother role always comes first but then you want to make sure that the wife role gets in there, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: It's also really important and gives a lot back, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: Right. Exactly. I'll be able to report back on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Anything else that we should catch up on or think about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: I think that's everything. I think what was on my mind was being a little worried that I was having trouble with sleeping in this stretch, but I think it was also nice to know that we did go a longer time and it's not like I had to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Our next appointment again is three weeks because of your time off and my time off. Does that feel okay again or do you want to meet next week so that you then just have two weeks before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">CLIENT: I don't know. I wonder when I leave here today I'm sure I will think, \"Oh, three weeks is kind of a long time,\" but it's also nice to feel like I can be a little bit flexible and say that it is all right for three weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean you certainly did okay. I don't want to force you into it either way, but I'll let you kind of make the decision. Your options are right now we have it scheduled that it's three weeks. We meet again August . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">CLIENT: That Monday, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the same thing. If you wanted we could meet next week; I have times on Tuesday, the 23rd, and Friday, the 26th. We could meet once that week and then that just gives you one and a half weeks until the next one. You did fine; it's up to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">CLIENT: I think I'll try it. I'll keep the one that we have on the 5th and I'll just see how it goes. It's nice to know that I can . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Right. If you need to call, call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">CLIENT: Because when I didn't write down this appointment and you had left the message on my phone, you were like, \"It's this time, but call if you need time in between.\" I was thinking, \"Will I need time in between?\" I feel like I was kind of . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Did I place that thought there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">CLIENT: No, because I had already been thinking about that. I think I had had that trouble sleeping one night early on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">THERAPIST: Right after we scheduled. That was different. That was the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah, in my head. And then thinking, \"I wonder will I need time?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: I think more so than it being the time, I think it's the difference. It sounds like what happened is we scheduled, we noted that it was different than our typical pattern, and then you went home and worried whether or not that difference was going to be a problem, rather than it actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201371\">being the amount of time. Just like with doing the conference instead of your regular work week. It's a difference and you wonder how that's going to happen because you're not quite trusting that you can be flexible. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I also feel like a part of me really wants to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">THERAPIST: More flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah. There is a piece of me that felt like if I had to call in between, does that mean that I'm having trouble? I didn't like the feeling of that that I wouldn't be able to make three weeks and I would need to call. It would be fine and I would do that if I wasn't feeling good, but it would <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D1\">make me feel disappointed, I think, that I wouldn't want to have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">THERAPIST: You don't want to feel reliant in the way that you were reliant upon a very structured bedtime routine for a while, getting off of that. I think you're overarching goal is now flexibility, both with rules with schedule and I think you can do it. It's not so much that you aren't flexible, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F1\">but that you don't believe that you can be flexible. I think it's lining up your head with what you actually can do, letting yourself trust that you actually do have the skills to be more flexible, to be resilient; and doing these little experiments of challenging your rules is your way of proving that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F2\">to yourself. So let's make that the goal, to maybe notice some more rules, to challenge yourself to bend them a bit, and then kind of log that in your head like \"Oh. There's something I was able to be a little bit more flexible on,\" so that you can start to really believe in yourself. Why don't we <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F3\">stop there and do a couple minutes of relaxation? Thank you. Even with the mad dash, huh? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I even remembered that. I was shocked. Todd was funny. He's doing work somewhere in the square right now. He's like, \"Let's extend our vacation and I'll meet you for lunch after. Is that okay? That's going to break one of your rules.\" I was thinking I was going to the library.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">THERAPIST: That's homework in action. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">CLIENT: So that will be good. We can meet later for lunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">THERAPIST: That sounds like a nice way to sort of end the vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">CLIENT: I know. He's like, \"We can do an hour of work after and then we'll go to meet for lunch.\" Easing back into work is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Let yourself get comfortable. You can close your eyes and let yourself focus on your body and just find a natural rhythm for your breathing, letting yourself take full inhalations and exhalations.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">As you settle into a rhythm, let yourself extend your breath, slowing it down just a bit allowing yourself to become more relaxed. (pause) Working at your own pace, whenever you're ready to inhale, as you inhale scan your body, noticing places where you might be holding tension and then let them go <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D1\">as you exhale. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">Repeating that process with each breath, noticing places where you might be holding tension. As you exhale let that go and your muscles relax.  (pause) Also taking a moment to check in with your thoughts. Notice what's in your head. As you exhale, acknowledge thoughts that you're holding there and let <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F1\">them go, letting yourself be present to this moment. Everything else can come back to you when you need it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2014E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559290\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">Today as you relax, let yourself think of a word or phrase or maybe even an image, whatever feels comfortable that, for, you represents being able to be flexible. (pause) Maybe something that you think of as being flexible, a word that holds onto that meaning for you. Whatever works for you. And whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201511\">you come up with, let yourself breathe in and think about that. Exhale and let yourself embody it, letting yourself get comfortable with that idea. As you breathe, check in and notice any places where you might have let yourself hold onto some tension. Exhale. Let yourself relax and then connect it <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201512\">to that word or image that you came up with.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">Let yourself repeat that process as many times as feels comfortable, letting your breath stay relaxed and full. (pause) Whenever you feel ready, holding onto relaxation, holding onto your image or word, let yourself come back to the room at your own pace. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">Can I ask what you came up with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">CLIENT: I was thinking about when I was doing that Pilates class. When I was in high school before, I would take classes and stuff, and it reminded me of that. It was really fun to be all dancing at the same time to music. That's what I was kind of thinking about. Even though I wasn't going along with <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201571\">the rest of the class, the energy and the music and stuff was fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">THERAPIST: But you felt comfortable. Fun is a great it's very hard to be tense and have fun at the same time, so for you, it sounds like maybe rather than thinking about relaxing or being flexible, the idea of getting into that fun, actually having fun is such an important piece of being comfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201591\">and being relaxed and being alive. So there's your key right there. Hold onto that. I'll see you in a few weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">CLIENT: Good. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Enjoy your lunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">CLIENT: Thank you. I don't know where we'll end up going. Someplace that will be cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">THERAPIST: Well, almost everywhere has air conditioning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20163\">CLIENT: We were laughing, though, waiting for the ferry at 7:10 this morning, it was hot. We were like, \"Why are we going back to New Haven?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20165\">THERAPIST: Enjoy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20167\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
