I took a couple notes and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s see. (inaudible 00:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I just wrote down some items that [I guess] (ph) we can talk about. But as far as the (pause) compulsive patterns and thoughts, I feel like they\u2019re still pretty much diminishing. Of if it does come up, I have a pretty good handle on, you know, sticking to the protocols. I feel like I\u2019m still <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">doing pretty good in that aspect. I think the last time we talked more about focusing on some of my behaviors and mood patterns around my wife, so I kind of took notes on, you know, things to look for and those (ph), you know, to recognize. If I\u2019m feeling uneasy or whatever, you know. Then we had self-compassion <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">and see if anything pops up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">So kind of recognized stuff, and it was more, like, I found myself getting irritated or agitated. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right word just for, like, petty little things that shouldn\u2019t be. And I think I kind of maybe, like, wow, why would I really even get irritated by that? You know, I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">if I\u2019m just, like, you know, ultra-sensitive to any shape or form of thing, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re saying you got irritated at her or at just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I was irritated at her, but not really trying to direct it towards her? Like, I don\u2019t even know. Like, some really stupid example is if we\u2019re sitting there eating soup, you know, and she\u2019s eating hers and making, like, a slurping (ph) noise, for some reason, that really sometimes just irritates <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">me. And I\u2019m like, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. I shouldn\u2019t do that, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Although, actually, that\u2019s not uncommon. It actually has a diagnosis. It has a label for it. It\u2019s where you\u2019re sensitive to people are sensitive to those kind of sounds. Chewing popcorn, potato chips. Toast. Slurping sounds. So you\u2019re in company [in case] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I (ph) was just random thing I noticed. I think the one thing I noticed the most was if I felt myself in, like, a slump or a foul mood, I got that way because (pause) I feel like a lot of times my emotions or mood shadow her mood. But not one-to-one, because she might be doing great <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">and happy, but she didn\u2019t show it in an exuberant way like I might. So it\u2019s like I have this offset and, you know, I think she might be, you know, upset. We talked about her, you know, mad about something when she\u2019s not at all, and that reflects on sending (ph) my mood into kind of [I don\u2019t know] (ph). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">That kind of sucks. Whereas the opposite, where she might, you know, talk about something and I might take that to the other extreme, you know. Like if we\u2019re in a social situation and, you know, something comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">But we did have some experiences where we were at a holiday party for a school. Everything was good and fine. I didn\u2019t have an anxiety. There was no you know, we were around 60 different people I\u2019ve never even met. You know, (inaudible 03:23) her introducing me. Me chatting with them. I didn\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">have any (pause) occurrences. So it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s real, you know, hit and miss on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Right, but I don\u2019t think you really understood the example of the exuberance or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Well\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: the opposite of the (ph)\u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So, you know, she might be, you know, had a long day at school or work or whatever. She [might even] (ph) just relax on the couch, you know, and just kind of zoning out because she had a long day. And, you know, I might take that as, you know, she\u2019s uninterested in talking to me or she\u2019s, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">know, just grumpy about something, when she\u2019s not at all. And I reflect on that as her mood being poor, so then mine kind of gets (inaudible 04:11). It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I got that one, but I thought you were saying the opposite was also true, and I didn\u2019t understand the opposite one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Okay, let me talk about the opposite one. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So she\u2019s feeling happy and you feel exuberant or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Well, I just, like, I think I actually show my ups and downs more than she does. So I would, you know I\u2019m more expressive of things, and I think a lot of times I look for her to express her emotions the same way as I do. You know, if she doesn\u2019t, then I feel like, well, that\u2019s why isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">she expressing the same way that I would, you know? Or, as I\u2019m more (pause), you know, shy and softer spoken in public, whereas she might be more outspoken and direct. And, you know, that\u2019s where I kind of get the, like, \u201cI wish she wouldn\u2019t have said it that way\u201d type of feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Right. But let\u2019s go back to the one just before that, when you said, \u201cShe\u2019s not as expressive of her joy or happiness as I am.\u201d Say more about what do you think that means, or what do you imply out of that? She\u2019s not as happy as seems like she ought to be or I would in that scene (ph). And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">therefore where do you go next with that? What\u2019s that mean, that she does -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: So I think I perceive her emotions different than they actually are, and then that kind of, like, for some reason, impacts the way I\u2019m feeling at that time. And I\u2019m not sure -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: And so how do you how does it impact you if she\u2019s not expressing it as up as you would?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I think I just kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Is it as you would, or as you think she ought to because that\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s as I would think she -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So therefore, why isn\u2019t she -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: ought to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Is it then what\u2019s wrong with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, almost. [And then that] (ph) just makes me kind of, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: So concerned or annoyed about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: More annoyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Annoyed that she\u2019s not being as expressive as it seems like she ought to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And just because, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I had a lot of obviously, I\u2019m recognizing different things, but I don\u2019t have -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So is there a pattern there? [Do you see] (ph) what that pattern is? We (ph) combine the negative and positive and different levels. Do you see a trend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Should I be? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well, [I don\u2019t know] (ph). To the degree we can join them together, then we can see it as one, you know, understand (ph). Like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s almost like what you said earlier, was for some reason I don\u2019t know why I feel like I\u2019m expecting different reactions out of her than she would give, and I\u2019m not sure why I would expect certain things. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s part of the whole controlling aspect where I, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">like, (inaudible 07:21), you know, compulsive disorder, where, \u201cOh, I would have rather had her be more softer spoken about that.\u201d Or, \u201cI would rather her be more excited about that.\u201d You know, I made a nice chicken dinner, whatever, you know, and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s good,\u201d and that was it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not just related to things you\u2019ve done.

It\u2019s like I overanalyze whatever she\u2019s feeling. I\u2019m not sure why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: So what are you trying to figure out? By trying to figure out what\u2019s going on with her, what are you then trying to figure out? So I\u2019m trying to go up a level, if I can. I don\u2019t know any of the answers here. I\u2019m just (inaudible 08:16) machete her. I\u2019m trying to hack through the path through the jungle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: It\u2019s weird because it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019ve done this type of analysis, and it\u2019s almost like it kind of goes in spurts, I don\u2019t know, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019ll ask you a different question then. (inaudible 08:36) So if these things happened and you didn\u2019t look at them, study them, try to figure them out, what is that part of you afraid might happen? What do you think you might lose or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: If you don\u2019t track that and try to understand it. What bad might happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I think I feel like I\u2019ll lose compassion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll lose compassion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Like, if I just kind of let obviously, if I overanalyze anyway, that\u2019s not good. But I feel like I\u2019ll lose I don\u2019t know. Maybe I don\u2019t (pause) I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m really afraid of anything. I mean, it\u2019s just it\u2019s hard to explain. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So you don\u2019t know. Is that what you\u2019re saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: So you have a sense of how you could find out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Go back to our same protocol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Which would be what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Just don\u2019t even think anything. Don\u2019t even go down that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Right, so don\u2019t allow myself to try to figure things out about that. Don\u2019t let it. And if you do that, as an experiment, it may give you a clue as to what provokes your distress, right. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m (ph) not finding that answer now.\u201d I mean, I would guess it would have something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">to do with control. I\u2019m losing track or something or I\u2019m guessing. Losing track or losing control of something, because you\u2019re not saying, \u201cI then challenge her,\u201d necessarily. You don\u2019t say or maybe you do. Do you then go, \u201cYou kind of took that kind of light (ph). Didn\u2019t you think that was pretty great?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Sometimes. But I also then try to go with our, you know, thing of if I feel a certain way, like that, I\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, I just kind of had a thought, but I\u2019m not going to go into a why, you know, I would, you know, be upset.\u201d But there is times that I, you know, would dive more into the details <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">than I would need to, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Right. So to catch yourself and to let go is an exploratory task to discover. As opposed to, here\u2019s how you know fix that problem. Just don\u2019t because we don\u2019t know enough about it, really. We\u2019re still trying to have an understanding. You have you\u2019re searching analytically for answers, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: So I would suspect that it\u2019s not going to be analytic it\u2019s going to be emotional and that the analytic side is somehow protecting you, holding things together. Something. So if you cannot track that, just let that go and see what might come up next. Then maybe we\u2019ll find out if it has <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">something to do with (pause) separation. Individuation. You know, that term, individuation. You can image what that means. Separation and individuation is really what kids do through adolescence as they leave home and so forth. They have to be distinguished from the family and so forth. But some families <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">are enmeshed (ph), and sometimes couples do the same thing.

And I think sometimes, when we don\u2019t get that time together, it almost, like I feel like I\u2019m being kind of pushed away, but it\u2019s not on purpose, from <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">her, you know. And I think that tends to lead me more into the, like, the little things, you know, getting me either upset or frustrated or, like, whatever. And then, you know, if we do get to spend some time together, getting kind of (pause) be (ph) back together, then it seems like I\u2019m in a better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">mood or whatever. So it kind of, you know, a little bit like your -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: So you got a little data about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And then, as we look at this stuff, it seems like it\u2019s something to do with, \u201cI have to figure this out. I can\u2019t let this go by. If I let this go by, something\u2019s going to start to unravel.\u201d That\u2019s kind of what comes up for me. It\u2019s like, \u201cI need to track this, understand this, or something\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">going to slip away. Or she\u2019s going to slip away. Or before I know it, the relationship\u2019s going to start being less than what it needs to be. Or she\u2019s going to separate from me and go off and, you know, leave me.\u201d I\u2019m doing quotes in the air, right (ph). So, I mean, I just that\u2019s what pops up in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">head. Do you know what pops up in your head when you think about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: I think I don\u2019t I don\u2019t ever think about anything, like, she\u2019s going to leave me or anything like that. I think I have more of the fear of (pause) the way she comes off and says something or does something. If that doesn\u2019t agree with me, you know, my super sensitive aura about me, is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">going to lead us to (pause) kind of distance ourselves from each other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Leave me means \u201cI\u2019m holding the rope, and if I let go, they\u2019ll be no one holding the rope and she could float away, or the relationship could there could be a growing distance, and I better track that. Can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d So there\u2019s some kind of control -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, there definitely is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: piece that has to do with you know, we\u2019re all control freaks in one way or another, but we\u2019re looking at, you know, the specific way you might be doing it, in a way that\u2019s not that helpful to you. And actually, that your solution was causing the problem at some level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s definitely not constructive. But it\u2019s weird, because there\u2019s time when, a couple days, it\u2019ll be just everything\u2019s great. I won\u2019t get into any of these hollow (ph) moods. And then something little will come up, and I\u2019ll just like (sound effects) for, like, half a day, you know. She\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">recognize I\u2019m kind of just, you know, doing whatever, and she\u2019ll kind of give me my space.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: She\u2019ll give you your space?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, she\u2019ll kind of give me space and be like, \u201cWell, you know, you didn\u2019t seem like you really even wanted to speak with me, because you\u2019re kind of I don\u2019t know what. You just seem kind of down and in a foul mood, whatever.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I know. I kind of recognize that. I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">sure really why, but I [kind of] (ph) really snap out of it, like, (snaps fingers) just quick like that.\u201d Which I\u2019d like to be able to just (chuckles), you know, something (ph) maybe because I\u2019m (inaudible 15:55). Well, that\u2019s fine. And just let go. Which I think I need to (pause) kind of treat this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D2\">more like we did with the other, on the thoughts. You know, where\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And in addition, we want to do it in order to understand what drives it. If you let go of it, there should be some we would suspect there\u2019d be some kind of angst about that. Like, the part of you that thinks it\u2019s important to do that. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get a hold of. See <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">if we can uncover and communicate with, understand, listen to the part of you that is driving that behavior. And we don\u2019t have a hold of him yet. If we kind of do that things that would provoke him. Like, \u201cDude, she just made that innuendo, and you can\u2019t let that one go.\u201d You know, that\u2019s the part we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">looking for, to see what he might say. It\u2019s the threat. I\u2019m going to suspect it has something to do with separation. So, you know, so I\u2019m not consciously aware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">That\u2019s what happens with panic disorder sometimes. When we get some people who have panic disorder, and as they start to fall asleep, they\u2019ll panic, because, you know, they might have a kind of a twitch of an arm or something. That tends to happen as you start relaxing. And then all of sudden, there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">a loss of control at that moment (inaudible 17:28) understand it. Or if people who have relaxation-induced panic, because the observing ego so the working memory, the thoughts that are going on at any particular moment, there\u2019s a central executive and phonological (ph) loop is talking, and visual <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A12\">(inaudible 17:49) sketchpad is an (inaudible 17:52). I mean, is imagery and so forth. So in relaxation, the observing ego floats away and it (ph) stops tracking for a moment. That\u2019s kind of why it\u2019s so comfortable for people. Somebody with panic disorder needs to be in control at that moment. And as <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A13\">soon as they have the awareness that their awareness has gone away, they freak out. I mean, it\u2019s written in the literature, having panic attacks at that moment. So there\u2019s something in anxiety disorder around letting go of control. So that\u2019s why I would go in that I\u2019d be suspicious in that particular <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A14\">direction. That may not be it at all, but (crosstalk 18:28).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: I had another example I wrote down. It wasn\u2019t (pause) directly related to what we talked about. Well, I think it kind of goes back to when there\u2019s something that, like, I would even lose control over change, where so we have a flight to Georgia for Christmas, and we\u2019re coming back on the third <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">of January. And she e-mailed the other day and said, \u201cOh, gosh. My professor just said we have to be back on the second for class. What are we going to do?\u201d And immediately, I was kind of like, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d You know, I wasn\u2019t really mad at her necessarily, but I was just like, \u201cOh, crap. I have to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">this flight changed. It costs so much money.\u201d And I was expecting her to, you know, be upset about needing me to go change it and all this and the other. And I e-mail her back, and I was like, \u201cOkay, well I\u2019m (inaudible 19:18). I don\u2019t want to have to change this again.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">And, you know, later, she was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d be upset.\u201d She was like, \u201cI\u2019m your wife. We\u2019ll figure this out. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, yeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d I said, \u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to have to call the airlines again, because I already did it one time and it was a big hassle. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">And, you know, it costs a bunch of money. And I don\u2019t want you to be mad if you have to miss class.\u201d And, you know, it was kind of like this unneeded loss of control. I think that\u2019s what it kind of felt like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It would make sense to me that you\u2019d be bothered about that.

It was like I kind of got (pause) almost frustrated for, like, the rest of the day just thinking about like, oh crap, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s going to be another 300 dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: 300 hundred dollars. And she didn\u2019t come home [be like] (ph), \u201cWe have to get this changed.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. Well, I\u2019m going to call the airlines again.\u201d And she was like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. Just -\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cDon\u2019t even worry about it. I\u2019ll tell my professor I\u2019m going to miss that morning. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d So that was kind of like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Okay, well, you didn\u2019t tell me that. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: I was like, \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s right.\u201d (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You could have told me though. I wouldn\u2019t have been upset all day if you\u2019d told me that the option was to go ahead and keep the schedule that we had. So when she said that, then you were -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: I was like, \u201cYeah, you know, you\u2019re right.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But you were missing some information. You didn\u2019t know that you had that option, and it is pain in the neck to they can really gouge you. I mean, 150 dollars each to change a flight. And then, whatever the new cost of the flight is, if it\u2019s gone up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So that makes sense. You know, that\u2019s stressful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: But maybe that\u2019s not a maybe that\u2019s more of a normal example, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, maybe it\u2019s an normal example, but it is an example of you getting on yourself or having the wrong reaction or something. So that\u2019s the only I mean, that\u2019s the reason it\u2019s a useful example to say out loud here. So we got that homework assignment. Does that make sense, to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">tracking some of that? And does it happen frequently enough that it would actually occur in the next couple three weeks? This whole thing around her exaggerating one direction or another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I probably could set it up for maybe three weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Is it I\u2019m just saying, does it feel like it will come up enough to take a look at it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: At least a few times a week, I\u2019ll have some little weird mood shift.

Like, I don\u2019t want to live in, like, the [dump line] (ph) all the time, you know. I\u2019d rather be more uplifted.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It drags on you. It weighed on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s why we\u2019re talking about it. It\u2019s like (inaudible 22:20) doesn\u2019t totally understand. Doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And it\u2019s hurting me. And I don\u2019t like projecting it on to her and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s almost like if I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being uplifting, then I feel like I\u2019m being really down lifted, when she just her emotions might be just (inaudible 22:40). You know, she\u2019s not being super if I don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being really uplifting, I feel like she\u2019s being almost suppressing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">and then I kind of get hanging the head when -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Right. So it sounds a little symbiotic too as, you know, it takes two of us to be a whole me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s kind of weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s discomforting because, like, you know, I met you, and opposites attract. And it was great to, you know, be joined with you. And now I\u2019m going I\u2019m joining too tightly with you. There\u2019s some parts that are joining that really should not be joining, so to speak. Does that am I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">saying that in a way you can imagine, even if it\u2019s not the most articulate thing (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: No, I know what you mean, because that\u2019s my original when I wrote it down, I was like, \u201cMy mood and emotions are way too heavily swayed by my perception of her emotions or mood.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s sort of (inaudible 23:37) separation and individuation, that somehow I have gotten a little more meshed than is healthy for us. That\u2019s not my judgment that\u2019s your judgment, [I think] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s what -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019d probably judge [the same thing] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: (Laughter) Well, that\u2019s good that I wasn\u2019t completely off. So (pause) homework assignment, I guess, is we talked about something like that comes up, where normally I would (inaudible 24:05) in the dumps, I would just not even go into that. Just kind of let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s the piece around trying to figure it out is that you want to that\u2019s the main piece of homework that I was suggesting to you. As soon as I go, \u201cWhy does she [want to] (ph) what\u2019s (ph) going on with that?\u201d To be able to step back and go, \u201cOh, okay. This is one of these moments. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">I\u2019m not going to figure that out.\u201d Now, who knows what will happen to you going into the dumps, because you may still go into the dumps. Because I\u2019m assuming you posed the question see (ph), I\u2019m a little concerned about how I\u2019ve structured the homework with you, because you don\u2019t answer the question <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF2\">anyway. You just pretty much pose it like, \u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d which I think means, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m thinking too, like, \u201cWhy is she (pause) why did she either not give or give that reaction? I would have expected that she -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: That shouldn\u2019t have happened. That was not right. So trying to figure out why she did it is not the core piece here. Because you might go, \u201cBoy, you know, why?\u201d But I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a rhetorical question not a curious question. You don\u2019t then start analyzing. Like, somebody with OCD might <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">go, \u201cOkay, did I say that wrong at work, at the meeting at work today? Let me mentally review it. I need to do a mental checking on it.\u201d So it\u2019s not that. So when you go when you say it to me, why did that happen, it\u2019s more rhetorical. It\u2019s done at that point. You\u2019ve already made a decision that this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E72\">shouldn\u2019t be happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">CLIENT: Right.

What is it that that part of you is saying to you that brings <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">you into the low place? Is it enough to say this isn\u2019t right? Seems like there\u2019s another tagline that goes after that. This is wrong. Therefore, (pause) we\u2019re going to hell in a hand basket.

You could say, \u201cThis is wrong,\u201d and you get mad. You could escalate. It could be more like personality of OC personality disorder, if there is one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t really get mad. I just kind of, like (inaudible 27:07), you know, like, \u201cDammit, why did she (inaudible 27:11)? She must be mad or something.\u201d So I\u2019m just kind of like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: What was the \u201cdammit\u201d for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Because a dammit\u2019s mad. I mean, it\u2019s, like it\u2019s more like, \u201cDrat, why did that happen?\u201d (Crosstalk 27:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s, like, mad. But, I mean, I think it\u2019s just, like, sometimes I feel, like, this little frustration of it\u2019s almost like agitated or is it irritated or agitated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Well, irritated is like annoyed. Agitated is like stinting. More physically. It\u2019s more like energy is agitation. Irritation is more of a mood, an angry (ph) or mad mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessarily mad, other than it\u2019s like I just kind of sulk. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m expecting her to be like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like something got spoiled by that. What got spoiled?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (Pause) That\u2019s a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s why I was questioning a little bit the homework assignment. I was like, well (ph) this isn\u2019t I\u2019m asking him to do something that\u2019s not going to give us any information, because you really don\u2019t go tracking it. You may stay preoccupied with it a little bit, but, you know, (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201031\">28:33) a whole intervention around that, just letting it go. But you\u2019re going to rapidly get a mood. It\u2019s going to just show. So to try to do something consciously at that moment, I think you\u2019re just going to get (inaudible 28:50).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: When I was driving here, I kind of laughed at myself. I was like, \u201cI think honestly what I need, I just need an attitude adjustment sometimes. Like, I just need to have a different outlook on, like, everything she says or does doesn\u2019t have to seem like it sucks to me. Like, she hardly ever really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201051\">ever gets mad. It\u2019s almost like I just need an attitude adjustment and be like \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: But, you know, that\u2019s all I think about, how to do attitude adjustments. When you say that, it\u2019s like everything I think about is how to alter perception on this. Now, when we have to be careful around that invitation to have an attitude adjustment, because you quickly go to, \u201cWhat the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201071\">hell\u2019s wrong with me, that I\u2019m doing that?\u201d So that also is an attitude. So there\u2019s the compassion coming in. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, well that\u2019s happening.\u201d Right. But what do we do when the mood shows up? So the event occurs. You rapidly fall into the hole for a bit. Now, this would happen equally, whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201072\">it\u2019s her not having the exuberance and her (pause) on both sides of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: Kind of, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Right. So it happens quickly. And how would you want to respond? How would you want to adjust your attitude about that (inaudible 30:24) all of a sudden sinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Make a guess?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to sink. I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: Good luck with that. (Laughter) I think it happens automatically. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: It happens automatically, so to go and consciously try to keep myself from sinking is going to be a setup to cause more trouble for everything (ph). Let\u2019s presuppose the sinking experience occurs. How do you want to response to that? What would be an attitude adjustment at that moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: Just give self-compassion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">THERAPIST: And how would that look in that moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: [That would be] (ph) just accepting the feeling you just had and being like, \u201cSo what?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Okay, so accepting. What does accepting mean? [I\u2019m sorry to put a fine point on it] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">CLIENT: I guess accepting that my mood just went south.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: Okay. So it\u2019s okay with me that my mood and then you said, \u201cSo what.\u201d What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">CLIENT: Not, like, thinking, like, self-punishing. Like, \u201cOh gosh, here we go again. I just, you know, got affected by something she said. Now I\u2019m going to be slouchy (ph) for a while,\u201d or, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">THERAPIST: Okay, good. So the general principle, one of the general principles you and I are working on is I\u2019m not going to I\u2019m not changing so much what suddenly happens, but I\u2019m changing my response to what suddenly happens. So suddenly, I\u2019m going, \u201cWhy is she doing that?\u201d Or, \u201cWhy\u2019d that happen?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201271\">I\u2019m not going to change that. That\u2019s automatic. That\u2019s coming what we would say is it\u2019s unconsciously immediate. So I can\u2019t consciously control something that is unconsciously immediate. It\u2019s going to show up too quickly to intervene. So the next thing, the only next thing I can do, is change my response <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201272\">to it. So when I go, \u201cOh, why is she having that? Oh, okay. Well then, I can notice that I, you know, notice that I just said that, asked that question to myself.\u201d That\u2019s an intervention. Noticing it is an intervention, because it separates you from it, right. You\u2019re not longer a hundred percent the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201273\">actor in the drama. There\u2019s a part of you that\u2019s going to, \u201cOh, I just had that. Oh, there\u2019s that reaction.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I think, in the past, I wouldn\u2019t even (pause) I didn\u2019t really have I didn\u2019t really notice that I was getting so slumped. It was almost just like a something triggered it, then it went boom.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Oh, that just happened.\u201d And then we, you and I, want to consider that an intervention, because I have separated <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201371\">from it. It\u2019s no longer dominating me because I have a perspective. I\u2019ve altered my perception to have an observer of this. It doesn\u2019t much else than notice it, so there\u2019s the observer. And then I can add to it, which is, you know, not just a neutral observer, but I can have a supportive observer. Fine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201372\">Fine, I just (inaudible 34:27) interesting. I just had that reaction. Fine.\u201d And then if you slide into that slump. \u201cOh, boy, there\u2019s that. Noticing the question didn\u2019t keep me from getting in here, did it? Okay, well there I go. I\u2019m in that space.\u201d This is going to be the harder one. Because when you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201373\">in a mood, you don\u2019t want to do anything else. (Laughter) It\u2019s hard to get a perspective. In some way (inaudible 34:59). Because you have been good enough to say it to her when she calls you on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">\u201cBoy, I seem to I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, you know. Okay, honey. I\u2019ll give you a little time,\u201d right. You don\u2019t get to do that so easily, because you\u2019re inside your skin. So you don\u2019t get to go, \u201cOkay, well I\u2019ll wander off,\u201d right. So when you notice yourself sinking, you want to be able to step <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201391\">back. Have some, even it\u2019s only four percent of you, go, (sighs) \u201cThere it is again.\u201d And then we were just talking about, how can I be compassionate toward myself at that moment? And I was a little concerned about where you went next. You were going like, \u201cOh, well,\u201d or something. So you want to abandon <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201392\">yourself at that point. What do you think would be a good way to take care of yourself in those (inaudible 35:56) they last a half hour or a half day. Do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: Do I know what? How to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: What helps. Have you ever found the best way to support yourself when you\u2019re in a slump?

Do you\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s almost like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: Do you just keep moving, and it just colors (ph) everything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: It\u2019s almost like this weird thing where I want her to notice I\u2019m kind of, like, mopey.

If you don\u2019t feed the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B1\">monster, you\u2019re not going to [go down that] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and that\u2019s not a bad thing to do. However, we want to make sure we\u2019re not putting the work on her shoulders, which is, \u201cI don\u2019t have any choice here. I\u2019m just going to come up like a sad puppy. But don\u2019t fall for it,\u201d you know. So how are you going to participate then, if you\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D1\">to ask her to not you\u2019re going to have her not say what\u2019s wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

And I got myself in a slump, and I\u2019m going to get myself out of this slump (inaudible 39:46) I\u2019m just cluing you in about it, okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201751\">So don\u2019t be like don\u2019t try doing your typical \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20177\">CLIENT: Is that what you were saying is good for my -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m talking out loud about that. That would be a way to do it.

So if we go to her, now you got her attention, and you\u2019re conveying to her that something\u2019s not right, but you\u2019re asking her. You\u2019re telling her, \u201cI\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201792\">not going to tell you what happened. I don\u2019t want any reassurance from you. I am in kind of a slump, so I\u2019m going to if you notice that, it may take me a little while to get out of it, but\u2026\u201d Something like that. Is that conceivable to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wish there was a way, I mean, I could (pause) figure it out without involving her. But, I mean, she doesn\u2019t mind to be involved because she knows I\u2019m\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2017A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">CLIENT: I just wish there was a way I could not even bother her with the whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">THERAPIST: But maybe it\u2019s not a bother. Because it\u2019s therapeutic. You\u2019re saying (inaudible 41:24) you can talk to her (inaudible 41:25), \u201cLet me tell you what Reynolds and I were talking about.\u201d And you can say, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m going to try. I don\u2019t know if it will work.\u201d And then she feels like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201811\">\u201cOh, well, that thing that he does that\u2019s irritating as hell to me, he\u2019s starting to work on it. I\u2019m all in. Man (ph), whatever I can do to help him stop doing that shit, I\u2019m on board. So there\u2019s a chance that she would be okay with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. She\u2019d totally be fine with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20185\">THERAPIST: And so, what you can say is, \u201cThere may be times in which I\u2019ll do that with you.\u201d And if you want to try to not involve her sometimes, then that would be okay. We\u2019re messing with it just talking about it here. So, you know, if you find other ways to mess with it, that\u2019ll be okay too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20187\">CLIENT: I just wonder if there\u2019s another alternative to whenever I got in whatever mood, after, you know, I notice it and then, you know, bringing myself down for getting in that, if there\u2019s another besides saying, \u201cHey, I just kind of got into\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah, however. What if what you need is attention? Just attention. And you\u2019ve got this twisted way that you\u2019re getting it. And so now, we\u2019ll still get you the attention. \u201cHey, honey.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018B\">CLIENT: That is kind of funny because I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018D\">THERAPIST: \u201cThere\u2019s something going on. I\u2019m [going to] (ph) work on it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018F\">CLIENT: I do think that I\u2019m a very attention-seeking individual from her. Like, I\u2019m always wanting to sit next to her on the couch or have my arm around her. And she\u2019s always like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m giving you attention.\u201d I think it is kind of the (laughter) backassward way of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20191\">THERAPIST: Right. And so, I think there\u2019s a lot to be said. I mean, I\u2019ve done so many groups in my career that I see it all the time in groups and family structures and so forth, that people will act out, do all kinds of things. When really, what they need to do is raise their hand and say, \u201cI need <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201911\">some attention.\u201d And I\u2019ve literally had people do that sometimes, you know. They just circumvent their acting out and just go, \u201cI need some attention,\u201d you know, or, \u201cI need a hug.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20193\">CLIENT: I think I sometimes almost irritate her in a funny way, I think, just to get some attention sometimes. (Laughter) Not thinking about it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20195\">THERAPIST: Right. And so that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying to you you were saying, \u201cWell, I hate to kind of use her.\u201d But in reality, you\u2019re also telling me, you know, \u201cI\u2019m wanting things from her all the time anyway.\u201d So we go, you know, kind of a cleaner route. We go up a couple levels of abstraction and think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201951\">be suspicious that maybe it has to do with attention. So let\u2019s go right to it, and say, hey, you know, whatever. And all these other things you\u2019re talking about, even to have that expression, that\u2019d be a funny thing to ask her for, right, is just to say, you know. And [just start going inside] (ph). <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201952\">If you can start having that awareness of, \u201cOh, I\u2019m doing it again. I think I\u2019m ready to tease or I\u2019m ready to fill in the blank.\u201d Instead you go, \u201cHey, honey. I need some attention.\u201d (Laughter) It could be a little joke, a running joke that you have for a long time. You go, \u201cYeah, I can remember when <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201953\">he started saying he just went right to it and said, \u2018Honey, I just need some attention.\u2019 You know, and I said, \u2018Well, how would you like it?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, this is good. I like this. Okay. So how about hold my hand?\u2019\u201c You know, see where it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20194-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20194-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560167\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20197\">CLIENT: It\u2019s kind of funny because I think that kind of comes back to it going in spurts, as where if we just spend a lot of time together on a weekend, maybe doing something fun, I\u2019ll feel almost, like, satisfied for X number of days. And then she gets really busy studying, going to school. We see <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201971\">each other in passing. It\u2019s like I need this thing, and then anything little thing, I kind of like (humming). \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cWell, I need some attention.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019B\">CLIENT: So I just try to make it more -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Right. So let\u2019s act as though that\u2019s it, and just see what that brings us, what it offers. And you\u2019ll either find out whether that\u2019s satisfying or it\u2019s not. But let\u2019s act as though that\u2019s it and put energy towards, \u201cLet me see if I can be more you know, even if I\u2019m feeling impish (ph). <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2019D1\">You know, how do I catch it and say -\u201d And I think you ought to tell her upfront that that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re going to do, and then it will be some kind of expression, like, \u201cHoney, I\u2019m needing some attention right now.\u201d And what that means is I got something going on. I\u2019m going to try to be more <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2019D2\">straightforward. We\u2019ll (ph) stop, but how would you like to receive the attention? What kind of attention would you like? How would you like it delivered?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019F\">CLIENT: Are you asking, like, how I should tell her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A1\">THERAPIST: No, I\u2019m asking you what kind. How would you like what attention do you want to receive? Do you want it to be physical? Do you want it to be (pause) just touch? I mean, do you want to be something verbal or you want it to be eye contact? You want it to be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A3\">CLIENT: I think, like, a little, like, combination of just being, like, almost recognized. Like there\u2019s the eye contact. The physical presence of, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m, like, I\u2019m here with you right now. (inaudible 47:00) feel like I\u2019ve got some attention.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And so, and you can play around with that. You can say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s just, you know. What you been doing the last half hour?\u201d You know, just let her talk to you a little bit or tell her something, where you just have a little exchange, oral exchange (inaudible 47:19) related to sex. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201A51\">(Laughter) Just, you know, in the exchange, you\u2019ll receive the attention because you\u2019re going to be hearing her tone of voice and looking at her eyes. She\u2019s going to respond to you and things, and that\u2019ll so it\u2019s fine to create a context within which you receive it. Like, \u201cHey honey, I want to release <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201A52\">a little tension right now.\u201d Okay. And then you just chat even, or get a hug. You can just try it out physically. You could ask her to say something sweet to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is interesting [the way] (ph) you talk about the different types, because I feel like sometimes I need the emotional attention. Sometimes it\u2019s the intimate.
