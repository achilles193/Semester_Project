(sighs) (pause) So I'm waiting to hear from something from New York and I'm having the usual response. I think I'm also feeling a little bit unresolved about, you know, our interaction and our process, productivity, etc. Also usual. At any rate, the run over here was kind of a bellwether <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">(ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Although (clears throat) I think I was possibly unusually conscious of, you know, kind of the process. In other words, at one point I just stopped and started to walk. I remember thinking to myself, again more explicitly than has sometimes been the case in the past when this has happened. A couple of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">times since I started running over here. You know, \"I'm fine with being a couple of minutes late.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">You know, hauling ass, I didn't want to. I didn't want to run at the speed it would take here to get here at 7:45 as opposed to 7:46. It's probably the difference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So I mean, I guess (pause) I guess that's pretty plain and maybe the process is also plain and a sign of something. Being a little bit more conscious of what my response is. I'm not articulating it well. Being a little bit more conscious of the extent to which these kinds of things which are upsetting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and (clears throat) confusing often are, you know, the outcome of directed processes rather than just some -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: random phenomenon. Mitochondrial. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: epiphenomenal? (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Um. (clears throat) Yeah, I guess epiphenomenal is one way of putting it. Although, you mean that the physical response is epiphenomenal? Um. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I guess so. I guess that's one way of putting it. I mean it's only epiphenomenal in the sense that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: What I meant was, [I was sort of saying kind of lightly that] (ph), like you're seeing (inaudible at 00:03:48) that way then more psychological and meaningfully related to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Well, I mean it's psychological when it's not conscious. When it's conscious, if it's conscious then it's less psychological and more just, you know, kind of a decision. In other words, there are a couple of ways one could use psychological in this context. But, I mean, any sort of mental process, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">I guess, is ultimately psychological.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">But if, you know, I'm running to our appointment at 7:45 and I say just explicitly, \"You know, I don't want to get there at 7:45. I want to get there at 7:46 and 30 seconds.\" And I take steps to make that happen and indeed arrive at 7:46 and 30 seconds. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Then, I don't know, I suppose that's the psychological process because any cognition and decision is psychological. But it's for me, for whatever reason, I don't know if this is meaningful or significant, it's when it's unconscious and I just for no reason that I can really point to slow down <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">in the middle of the street in a way that would kind of delay my arrival. That feels like a psychological phenomenon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Whereas the first scenario does not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: And I think that it's convenience from the standpoint of our process in the sense that that, you know, the more conscious it becomes, allowing for, you know, different decisions potentially in different situations, the less need I have of somebody who's belief (ph) it is to counsel on the psychological. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">Making this an actual therapeutic process rather than simply an analytical one. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559650\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: But at any rate, the action as always was epiphenomenal in the sense that it's to be thought. (pause) Although it's probably complicated. I think often people rationalize the things that they do. Anyway, we go around and around about it. But it didn't feel epiphenomenal, it felt like two parts <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">of a coherent process. Slowing down that with the I missed the point that you were making? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: (sigh) That was the point. I was just substituting [what happened to be] (ph) a slightly different word over kind of like what you were saying. And to me it seems like we're not really far apart on this. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, like this is a bigger issue that I think I wrestle with. And, as a result, we wrestle with it. You know, the question is, \"What kind of an (inaudible at 00:08:02)?\" You know, assume that I feel fine about this particular instantiation of this process. But assume that I'm not, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">assume that it's very troublesome as it often is. You know, where do you intervene?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Do you intervene with the phenomenon or do you intervene with the epiphenomenon? Do you intervene with, you know, kind of the, an attempt to understand, you know, the thought behind it better and try and monkey with that? Or do you intervene with some kind of physical manifestation or process?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I mean, I think we've been kind of beating around the bush of this dyad for a while now and maybe not so productive. And, you know, it comes up in a bunch of different ways. One of the ways that it comes up that has been, you know, the subject of much debate in our conversations, has been, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">whether an instrumental or an analytical approach is the right one, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">That feels like basically the same kind of question. If you say that something is epiphenomenal then, you know, the next step is to say, \"Okay, well what's the phenomenon and how can we intervene or understand or appreciate the phenomenon rather than the epiphenomenon, which is relatively uninteresting.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I guess that was why I was reacting that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I have always maintained, I mean that's obviously part of my whole view which I made clear to you, that these things are connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: And all I was doing is, like three minutes ago when this started, you said, you know, \"Hey, these things seem more meaningfully related to me.\" Then, as though, the one is a kind of, you know, physiological, nearly physiological, process. And I said, \"Yeah, as though it were epiphenomenal.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Okay. I got you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That's all I said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I missed the subjunctive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: The subjunctive food (ph) was lost and, therefore, a diversion. But, yeah, now I get you. (clears throat) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: And (pause) And the next thing you're describing is (pause) a (pause) Sorry I'm trying to (inaudible at 00:11:22). It's sort of Well, what I think is, your frustration in a related, perhaps a point of disagreement between us, about whether any more instrumental intervention would be more helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559650\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Like, in other words, you have often felt like, \"Marshall, tell me what to do when this happens, when I get in this place or this mood. What do I do? What do I do about it that's going to make it better? Don't just,\" in some sense, \"sit here and talk to me about it or try to understand it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">because that's not doing anything as far as I can tell.\" (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Like the problem is that I'm slowing down. The problem is not that I'm ambivalent about coming to our sessions because we're having a fight, or because we're in the midst of a conflict (inaudible at 00:13:00). Or because it doesn't feel like I'm making progress in these other areas. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Um.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Um. (pause) Hm. Well. (pause) (clears throat)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: (clears throat) It seems to me there's some important aspect of this to do with (pause) control. And again, to me it feels very much like you're sort of wanting to and trying to kind of wrestle with me over these things. And to like assert yourself in a really very strong way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">And I think that, as I'm sort of puzzling over why that would be, and one thing that occurs to me is it seems related to how you feel, I think, very much out of control when it comes to, for example, the kind of thing that I think is going on at work now that you sort of mentioned briefly a few minutes ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">When you're waiting to hear from somebody or you're waiting to hear about something from someone, usually at work, but maybe it happens with Jennie (ph) as well, I don't know. And there's kind of not much you can do but sit and wait. And that's usually the time that's very difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">At least I have the impression that, you know, one aspect of what feeling in addition to the disconnection is a kind of lack of control. You know, you're sort of passively waiting for the other person. And it seems like you're kind of, in a way, quite frustratedly, I think, doing (pause) not like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">opposite of that here, but something where I feel like you're kind of (pause) (inaudible at 00:19:49).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">So for example, what you just said a minute ago was about, you know, \"Yeah, because looking at why I \" This is what I understood was you were saying, \"Yeah, I was okay. I made this conscious decision it was okay to be a minute and a half late here. I don't want to run harder. It's not related to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">things we're talking about or what's going on between us.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: No. The opposite. I was saying that it was. I wasn't saying that it wasn't related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: No, I was saying, you know, we've been having kind of a conflict.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: You know. And it seems like you can have conflict with a psychotherapist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: (laughs) (cross talking at 00:20:42)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Or of course to the extent that you can have (cross talking). You know? What's another drop of water in the ocean. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: (laughs) What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: (laughs) Why do you go to see a therapist except to have a conflict?

I guess it relates specifically to, like the way it feels to you, is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201A31\">in particular like it's an insertion of a kind of status.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559650\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT: I don't think I've ever articulated that to myself, per se.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: And I'm not sure how far I would go with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">CLIENT: But (clears throat) at times it has felt, what I can point to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: A cognition that I can point to is the kind of monetization of your time versus my time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: If that makes sense. And monetization is, you know, at least in this society, a kind of status. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: [And then it being a status insertion.] (ph) (long pause) (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: I guess that makes me wonder if that's something that you feel, whether I'm asserting it or not. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I take your point. (pause) I don't think so. I mean, normally the way that I understand, you know, our clock is that you're providing a service and that there's some value, at any rate, to having it bounded in time. And I don't think it bothers me in particular. I think I'm asking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD1\">you for something, and so when you ask somebody for something I guess that establishes some kind of hierarchy between them in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">It's not something that I'm overwrought about or that feels particularly troublesome to me. But (pause) (sigh) I don't know. I mean, just let's displace this to another setting. You know, when you have two friends and one of them habitually late -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">CLIENT: you know, why would, like some people are very easy going about this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT: But some people aren't. You know, some people really get bothered by it, even with their friends. Why do they get bothered? They get bothered, you know, at some level because they're being selfish, but at another level because they're kind of asserting something potentially. Depending on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C71\">relationship and how it's understood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">You know, they're saying, you know, my If, for example, they always come and say, \"Well, you know, I had to finish up something at work.\" Jennie (ph) has gotten mad at me for this before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: I guess it occurs to me as we're talking that there's I feel like there is a, I think it is like even woven into our interaction right now about this in the following way. It seems to me consistently as you're making your points, that you almost like have a style of argument, a consistent <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB1\">(ph) style of argument, about which is to assert the reasonableness of your reactions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">You know? In a hypothetical, \"One person is late the other person is going to feel like this, and it's an assertion of this.\" That's not really an explanation of why you feel that way. That's a kind of legitimization. You know, it legitimizes feeling that way because it's reasonable. Which I think is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD1\">striking to me because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">CLIENT: Because you're not disputing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">THERAPIST: No, not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT: You're Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">THERAPIST: I mean, obviously my take is like, one person might be upset because they're very rigid and, \"We said ten o'clock it's ten o'clock, and ten 'o' one isn't ten o'clock.\" Another person says, \"Yeah, you're selfish. You know, you just do whatever you want.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">Another person says, \"Like, well you know, I don't even exist for you. It doesn't matter for you because it's not like \"It's more like being self-absorbed. It's, \"You're not even thinking about my time. You're just off doing some other thing.\" You know? There are like fifteen different ways it could feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559650\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: And you're asking, \"What of those fifteen ways is it for you?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because I'm interested in -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: And I'm returning to the formulation that, \"Well, you know \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: \"It's perfectly reasonable for me.\" [I'm charactering you now.] (ph) But, yeah, obviously my interest is in sort of, you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Okay. And then like I feel bad about being late. (cross talking at 39:40) I feel bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: (cross talking) I got it. I got it. I got it. (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: So anyway, my hypothesis about that is that there's this It comes across to me as though there is almost a status aspect to that where you, in a way -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: sort of somehow you're feeling you may have a lower status and need to be, you know, defended, legitimized. Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, maybe. Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: And I suppose any response from me could possibly be interpreted as a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">CLIENT: confirmation. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">CLIENT: As a confirmation just by the very fact that I'm arguing with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FB\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">CLIENT: So (laughs) I'm screwed. I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. Yeah, I don't know. The status thing, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">CLIENT: I think control resonates more for me somehow than status.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">THERAPIST: I see. (cross talking at 00:40:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">CLIENT: Although they are obviously closely related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20209\">CLIENT: I'm just sort of trying to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">CLIENT: recapture the, you know, thoughts that I had on previous occasions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">CLIENT: I remember thinking at one point, \"Well I'm glad I brought it up because it's now it's not going to happen again.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20213\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20215\">CLIENT: You know, now it will be clear and I've made my point clearly and I've been fairly, you know, explicit and sharp in my expression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20217\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20219\">CLIENT: This was a month or two ago. And so that would suggest very clearly that it was some issue of control here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021D\">CLIENT: That when you didn't show up as I had, and I was just kind of standing outside the locked door in the dark, going blind (laughs) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021F\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20221\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20223\">THERAPIST: All alone. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20225\">CLIENT: All alone. (laughs) You know, I was just out of control. I didn't have any control over the situation. And you know I, through this kind of frank airing of the subject, I had asserted control, so I felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20227\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20229\">CLIENT: And then it was doubly frustrating when it turned out that my assertion of control was for naught. And I think I felt that in New York quite a bit, you know, where there just in this constant dynamic of, you know, feeling like I've been able to assert control -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2022B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2022D\">CLIENT: and feeling, you know, good about it. And then it turning out to be out of my control and not hearing for a little while. And then it would be confirmation that my intervention had been successful. And then, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20231\">CLIENT: So there's just been this constant patination (ph) of, you know, attempts to assert control and an inability to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20233\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20235\">CLIENT: And the sense that I had been successfully able to do it and discovery that, in fact, I wasn't. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20234-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20234-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559650\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20237\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20239\">CLIENT: That has been I think upsetting so that it feels like there's an analogy there.
