(chuckling) So I do just feel like that's been one thing that I do think is a rule that I made for myself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: That doesn't really work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yea. Or just like maybe it does work. I adhere to it too well. And I'm realizing maybe I should be better about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What would be... so what would be the... if you allowed more flexibility with that rule, what would be the possible negatives?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I think it would be then I wouldn't get as much work done. And then it would be like that feeling of, oh, I hope I'm not going to have to do this some night after he goes to bed when I just want to relax and hang out with Todd (sp?). Or over the weekend when I just want us all to be together <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and I don't want to have to be away from Trae (sp?) doing work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So I wonder how much room there is? Is there some time that you can take for yourself or to do something else and not have it eat into... not have your work eat into other time when you could be like, right, like having alone time with your husband or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: ...having play time as a family. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. I think so. And it's hard to judge right now. Like I'm not... I have the daycare for him three days and then my mom hopefully will be able to do Tuesdays for us but probably just not regularly. But for most weeks, I bet I will have four days. So I think that should be fine but right now <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">I feel like I'm not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Right now is a really hard time to juggle it because you're starting this new phase that you don't know. When you were in classes you had idea already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yea. But I do feel like because this will be time like when I'm just holed up reading and writing, it would be good for me to get out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And I can get some fresh air or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yea. That's a... so that's this sort of like how you... what expectation you set for yourself for how much time, right? Because it's not like writing a paper or getting the assignment done where you know there's a stop point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: When you're doing this part of your work, how many articles you expect to read yourself in a day or how much data analysis you get done. It's such a hard thing to judge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: And so it seems almost trying to figure out what is your balance going to be? How much time do you need to feel kind of healthy or balanced or fulfilled whatever word works for you to meet with a friend, to talk over... whether that's meeting with a friend to talk over work or meeting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">with a friend to talk about the latest episode of whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Or just to check in with one another versus how much time you can really spend alone in a room with your data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Right, yea, yea. And I guess I'll just kind of see how that goes. But I think... and Todd (sp?) has been through this process too. Because I was talking with him and saying, \"I need to figure out a rule that I can practice with and bend a little,\" and telling him that this was an idea that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">had of just figuring out.  I was looking at the gym has a Zumba class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And so maybe once a week I can go do that or something like that. And he was saying that he experienced too that when he was in this analyzing writing phase too it helped him to kind of get out and do something in the middle of the day, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yea. So you might want to try that out and see what it feels like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: But it's almost like... I almost... like I didn't feel nervous but I felt like a twinge of nervousness for today. And I think it was because now like if I... I feel like if I propose this idea, I should probably follow it through. I want to do it. That would be good to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Good. That's one of your rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right. I know. That's true. But I do feel like it would be good for me to go try a Zumba class. But then it's also like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: So what's the nervous part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: That I'll actually do it. I feel like I've had these thoughts before. It would be great for me to go do a class in the middle of the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: So what would be worrisome about actually doing it? I wonder, what's the worry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yea, I think it is just like using up time and not getting as much done. Because I have like a deadline of June... of September 30 is when my full draft is due to my whole committee. So I'm hoping to get a draft to my advisor the very beginning of September or the end of August. So he can read <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">it and then I can make revisions and then I send it out to my whole committee. So there kind of are deadlines imposed already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So I think that's what it is. It's like I don't want to get myself caught.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: They're pretty far out though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yea. I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: They're... so in thinking about giving yourself some flexibility kind of figuring out when do you need to kind of check in on yourself there may be weeks when you use time to go to Zumba, use time to meet with a friend. And there may be weeks where you can't do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: And meet your goals. And so I think the idea of letting your rules be a little bit flexible so they don't... it doesn't mean that all daycare time is always work time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Some weeks it might be all work time and some weeks it might not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: It's interesting because the rules in themselves are not bad. It's when they feel too rigid and they can't change in order to meet changing expectations or changing your external world. Letting your internal rules flex with them...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: ...with how other things change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Right, right. Like I... it's not like if I decided I wanted to try Zumba, I had to go every week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right, exactly. You can let yourself figure out which weeks it makes sense and which weeks it doesn't make as much sense for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yea. I know. I think that would be a good way to think of it, too. But I do think... and that's like something I've wanted to try. I've never done it before.  My friends have done it. My mom has done it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What's stopped you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Just finding the time. I didn't even get a gym membership last school year just because I figured I wouldn't use it. But I did look into it and there are like a... there's a summer membership that you could get. So I could try it and see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yea, it sounds like a good opportunity to try something you've been thinking about and try out what it's like to see if you can allow your rule to change depending on the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yea. And it's funny because it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. But I've even had like a dream that I... and it was like this fuzzy, weird dream. But I think you had suggested in my dream that I go on this camping trip. And I was like, oh, that would be a great thing for me to try. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">on my way to the camping trip, I realized that I didn't pick up Trae (sp?). And I freaked out because I was the one getting him but I couldn't get him that day or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">And I didn't even think anything of it in the morning. And then as I thought about it later, I was like I bet that was kind of signaling to me that I'm like nervous about this idea of like using time. And like talking about it, it's not like, oh my gosh, I can't go to Zumba. I'm so worried about this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">I don't feel like it's like this huge thing weighing over me. But I thought that was funny. It is in the back of my mind of like not feeling totally comfortable with this idea of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: That doing something different would mean that you're losing out on something else if you change your current strategy or change your typical routine that you're going to miss out on either time with Trae (sp?) or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Because that sounds like that is what motivates you. That motivates you to use your time away from him and Todd (sp?) also during the work day. It's afraid of missing out on something with them later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Right. Yea, which in a way I feel like some of it's good because it has made me even more efficient. When I have the time, I just want to get things done.  But I do think it's swung the other way too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: At the expense of something else, yea. And I think... and that's probably true with most weeks. That there is obviously an importance and there's... you put them in place because they made sense and were good for you at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: And the only problem is when the get too rigid or when you're extending a rule that used to make a lot of sense for your former life maybe but doesn't necessarily make as much sense now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: And feeling like you need to stick to the rule rather than stick to figuring out what actually works for best for everybody right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yea. So I think thinking of this as not a rule that I'm going to Zumba either but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: ...just try it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: It doesn't... you don't have to swing in the opposite direction to make another really rigid rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: That the new rule is... what would we name the new rule?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Well, I think it's the idea... like that it is OK to just do something for myself. That's when I think during that time I don't like to do that.  I wanted to just use that time for work time so that I'm not taking away time from Trae (sp?). So I think it is loosening up to let myself to have some time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: I... if like thinking about it in a visuals help kind of thinking about the pie chart. Like what is in there. So clearly it sounds like there's time with Trae (sp?) in there. There's getting work done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: There's having some time alone with Todd (sp?) at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: How much of the space is there for Rachel (sp?)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yea. I mean, I don't... not a lot at all. And once in a while I'll meet up with a friend or something that... and we have... but a lot of times it's with Trae (sp?). We meet up with friends all the time when I'm home with him and we've got friends in the neighborhood that we'll meet up with. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">But yea, total like... without Trae (sp?) or without Todd (sp?), I feel like I don't have a lot of that. But I also don't know how much of that I really want either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, so do you... how would you know you had enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yea, I don't know. But I think it would be just like not feeling... like when I do have those moments of like, oh, I just want to get my hair cut and I don't have time for that. Or silly things that you just do for yourself that you don't have time to do. Maybe not feeling that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right, right. Not feeling like there is no time to do them. And also maybe not feeling like they're silly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yea, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Would you die if didn't get a haircut? Probably not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Will you feel better...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: ...if you could... if you had time to do things like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: It sounds like yea. There are times when you felt kind of stressed by the fact that you felt... feeling like you have something you want to do and not able to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So that's self-care. It's not that silly. That's actually fairly important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And so having enough space to be devoted to stuff like that overall.  Maybe not every day, maybe not every week but overall feeling like there's enough space there to do things. Like meet up with a friend without also being responsible for making sure that Trae (sp?) is OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Because there is that difference of being responsible to somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: And soon they get older and understand everything you say. The conversations are geared so much differently when there's grownups there and kids there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Who can really listen and yea, pick up on what you're saying. Yea. But Todd (sp?) and I have talked about that because once in a while he'll meet up with his guy friends for a drink or something after Trae (sp?) is asleep. And we said, like it's funny that when I meet up with my girlfriends, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">it's always with the babies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: And even sometimes like when we meet with my best friend Stephanie (sp?) who's down in Duxbury, we'll go down and then Todd (sp?) and her husband, Ethan (sp?) will go play golf or something and we'll be able...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Stay home with the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Which is great. That's... it's... we love having our babies play together and we have fun.  But it is funny that it's like a lot of my friend time and seeing my friends is with our kids which is fun but it just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: But it's not everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: Totally girl time to just... yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And so having a little bit of that is maybe also... maybe you're missing out on a little bit of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And maybe you don't necessarily want a ton of it. But it sounds like having some of it sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Have you noticed... is it... so I mean, clearly there's a difference in having or not having Trae (sp?). But a shift in your relationship with Todd (sp?) because that sounds like a very typical gender divide. And I'm not sure if that's how it felt before you had Trae (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yea. But I think he's so helpful and with so many things that I feel like stereotypically would be like the woman would be doing in the relationship that he's so helpful with that. That's kind of one of the few things that I actually do notice because I do feel like that is like a very stereotypical <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">thing. But otherwise I think we've gotten into...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: And part of it might be up until fairly recently you were breastfeeding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yea. I just went off of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: So if you went off to go play 18 holes of golf, it requires a little bit more planning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:16).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yea. But I think it also helped. Like the other way that I think Todd (sp?) always wanted to feel really useful when I was nursing Trae (sp?). So he would do the laundry or he would be doing the dishes or something. So he's so helpful with all of that that I don't really feel like that we go <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">along those divides and a lot of things and sometimes too helpful like that. I think we've talked about that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yea, you felt guilty almost not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yea. I feel like he sometimes tries to do everything. But I think that that has gotten a little better. You just don't realize how much time goes into breastfeeding. And now that... and pumping too. And now that a lot of that has gone, it feels better. Yea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I'm glad you're settling into it sounds like a more comfortable pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Sometimes just sort of massaging a little bit to see if you can find a little bit more flexibility for yourself either with him or using daycare time doesn't necessarily all need to be hard core work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: Right, yea. And I even... there was one of our... one mom who I got to know who also sends her kid to the same daycare. And she came the other day in her workout clothes. I could tell she had come from the gym and I was like, I should be doing that. So I think that is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: Or I could, yea, yea. But that would be my time to do something like that. And I think that's what gave me the idea of just try... if I wanted to try that out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yea. So your... the time you have in daycare can be time to do things for yourself or things for work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yea, it'd be interesting to see how you can arrange it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: And just even start to notice if you have other rules set up for yourself that don't work all the time or create some kind of distress rather than being helpful. Rules would be great if they're actually really helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Rather than feeling like they're restricting you or impeding upon something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yea. Yea, because I feel like I've also experienced that where they go too far. Like when I would have to read before bed. That became like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: It became a rule, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: ...too restrictive of a rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Where it got developed to be something that was helpful like a habit perhaps. And then became a rule that couldn't be broken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Even when it would make sense necessarily to break it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Right, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20118-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20118-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Does... are there any rules that people have for you that don't work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: I don't think so. But it is funny. I even noticed... because I've been thinking about this a lot.  And when I go to do my observations at the school, you have to sign in and sign out as you're leaving. And so it just like is a log of pages and pages of people signing in the time. And I noticed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D1\">that I'm one of like... probably the only person that signs out. I can look through the pages. I looked the other day. And the only person who had signed out on like three pages in a row was me. (chuckling) And so I was laughing kind of thinking like I definitely am a rule follower. I think that is a good way...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: So when you noticed that, so then you said you were laughing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: So what went along with that? What were you feeling as you were laughing as you noticed that? What were you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: Well, part of me was kind of surprised that other people didn't do that. But then I know I just... I don't know if it made me think I thought too much about it but just kind of thinking that that was very symbolic of my personality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yea, your rule following. Yea, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: And there was one day where I didn't sign the book. And I was then... I left really late that day. I was the next person to sign in on the morning and I saw that I hadn't. So I filled in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Then you filled in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yea. (chuckling) And then I was like, oh, was that the time that I left? I wanted it to be accurate even. But yea, I don't know. I think it... I think that was very symbolic of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yea, I think it's a really nice visual to have to remind of, OK, this might not be the degree to which everybody follows rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: And figuring out when is it really important and when is it not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: So I mean, I can almost imagine that if you had realized that you hadn't signed out, that that's something you would've worried a little bit about at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: And probably been able to let go of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: But you would have really noticed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: Whereas clearly lots of other people are not signing out on a regular basis and don't even know or know but don't care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: Yea, when I saw that I hadn't, I was surprised that I didn't think of that.  Like I feel like that would've been something too. That I would've wanted to just run back in and sign out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: But I think a little piece of it is with Trae (sp?), like if this... and I don't know why I think this. Because his daycare doesn't even know what school I'm at where I'm doing my research. But I think a little piece of it was if anyone needed to track down where I was, like I'm signing in, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D1\">they know I'm in the building and I'm signing out, they know I've left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: So I wonder if a little teeny piece of that was just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">THERAPIST: Do you also sign him in and out of daycare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: No, we don't have to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">CLIENT: Because it's a tiny little home daycare. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yea. I think that's actually...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">THERAPIST: So you're really just in the habit of it perhaps or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT: I know, yea. But his daycare is very relaxed and they hardly have any rules. Do you know what I mean? I feel like that's been a really good thing for me that we're not getting the little slips of paper every day that are documenting everything with him. And at first that kind of bugged me.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201611\">I wanted to know more of what was going on. But in a way I think that that's been really helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20160-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20160-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: You've gotten used to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: ...that I don't know every little thing and I can just be sure that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">THERAPIST: That you can trust that he's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">CLIENT: ...they're doing fine and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: ...that he's OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Because you pick him up every day and he's OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">CLIENT: Yea. Because I could see my... like I definitely wanted that at the beginning but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yea, so you saw that you can actually be more flexible and you can be more comfortable with not knowing not being in controlling and not knowing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: That's a good way to stretch yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: Right. And we joke because they primarily... they only speak French with Trae (sp?) during the day which we love. And I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yea, he's really going to learn that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yea, like there are some of the older kids who both their parents don't know any French but they're running around... like when we pick him up speaking French.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Sure, he'll pick it up. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: So we've loved that. But it's funny because there is a little bit even of like a communication barrier. When we pick him up, like they are fine and he can communicate to us what he's done.  But we don't get those little details of exactly when he went down for a nap and when he woke up. She's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201811\">like, \"Oh, he slept about two hours.\" But I think all of that really did bug me at the beginning. I really was craving that detail. And now I am OK with it. So I think that that's all been like helpful to know... we joke that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: Did you choose that going in? Did you know that it was going to be less structured and less...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: No, no. I mean, we knew it wasn't going to have the protocols and things that a center would need to have which we liked. We liked just having like a little... that just felt like a little more personalized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: Then we did visit just one center. So we kind of liked that aspect of it. That it was a little bit looser. But I think at the beginning if I knew... like I talked to one of my friends who sends their child there. And she said, \"Oh, you do get the little slips of paper home.\" And that comforted <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201891\">me thinking, \"Oh good, I'll know what he did all day.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">THERAPIST: And then it wasn't like that anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yea, at like the first little bit they did. But then it dropped off. But it... I think that has been good for me to just kind of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yea, it's been good to kind of push your boundaries and show... and have experience that it is... that it's been positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Because it's pushing your boundaries and getting you used to being uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: But being a little bit uncomfortable and it's been a positive outcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: And so you can kind of look back on that as you push yourself to try loosening some of your own rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: And think that like, \"OK, it was uncomfortable at first, but I actually enjoyed the outcome.\" And so kind of keeping that in the back of your mind as you do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2019E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Right, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Anything else we should be catching up on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: I think that was everything. That was... I have been thinking about it a lot. Just trying to be more aware of what the rules are that I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yea. So I encourage you to keep that up just kind of noticing when you feel like there is a rule that you're noticing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: And only try to break one at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yea, that's a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: (chuckling) So that you don't feel like you're losing all your anchors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: I know we haven't done relaxation in a while. So I stop us and wondered if you wanted to do some today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yea, that would be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: So let's schedule because I don't know if we have anything on the books. And then give you some time to do some meditation. (pause) (inaudible at 00:22:26) for you. So am I correct? I didn't see you but then sometimes when I don't look on normal... on a day that maybe we had scheduled unusually? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yea. I'm not sure that we had another time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Yea, we may actually not have. So when works... you have lots of flexibility now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: I know. (chuckling) Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: So how... when do you want to come back? Two weeks again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: That... yea. That would be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: OK. So that would put us on Monday the 8th. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: Or actually that is the only week where I won't have a lot of flexibility because I'm helping with a conference that week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: OK. So that week I have time just Monday and Tuesday. But I could also... we could push it off a week or we could meet on Friday. Oh no, we can't. That's Friday the 5th. So we... I have time Monday, Tuesday if anything works for you or we could move to maybe the 15th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: The 15th will probably be best because that's like it's an all-day institute. So it might be hard to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: So I can do anytime between... I have a 10:30, an 11:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: 10:30 would work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: All right, let's do that. (pause) Can we make it 10:40?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: And then we'll meet right up until 11:30. I just... the train schedule I might not be here right at 10:30. At the moment I don't have a 9:30. If I do, then it's no problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Otherwise I'll try to stay home and get something done for an extra half hour. (pause) And then... so we would normal do two weeks but that actually that last week of July is my vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: Oh nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: So we could do either Monday the 5th or we can meet Friday the 26th if you want to keep it closer to two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: I won't... so Fridays will be my day home with Trae (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: So I won't have anyone to watch him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: And I know now I definitely can't bring him with me. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: No, he's too old for that. He will want the attention but... so I could do Tuesday the 23rd or we could do the 5th again, Monday the 5th. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: I know the 5th will work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: OK. You want to do the 10:30 or 10:40 again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT: So that... yea, 10:40 will be great on Monday the 5th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: And that will also be the... so August starts your new insurance year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: Oh OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: And so I don't know where we are in session count.

(pause) Let's give you a few minutes to do some deep breathing. (pause) And so let yourself get comfortable. You can close your eyes. Begin to take some deep breaths at your pace. (pause) Let yourself take full inhales and exhales.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">Beginning to relax your body. Letting yourself clear your mind. (pause) Taking a moment to notice anything that feels tight, tense or uncomfortable. Thinking about taking a deep breath into those spaces. And as you exhale let go of the tension. Letting your muscles relax. Thinking about letting the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD1\">chair doing the work holding up the weight of your body. Let the floor hold the weight of your legs and feet. Noticing the thoughts that are stuck in your head. Acknowledging them and then letting them go for now and then float away knowing you can hold onto important things later. And now letting your <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD2\">mind be clear. Letting your body relax.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">Again, scanning your body and noticing any place that feels tight or uncomfortable. If there is a place that's hard, to let go of the tension. Think about tightening that space up even more on your next inhale and then relaxing fully as you exhale. Repeating that process as many times as you need to. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF1\">Scanning your body and noticing a tight space. Tensing as you inhale, relaxing as you exhale. Letting yourself become more relaxed with each breath.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">Perhaps letting yourself drift away to place where you are fully relaxed. (pause) Imagining the details of that place and letting yourself get immersed in every tiny detail. Noticing what it feels like to be there. What it feels like in your body. What it feels like emotionally. (pause) Let yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202011\">kind of soak up all the calm and peace that surrounds you there. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20203\">Maybe attaching a word to this feeling or place that you have right now. Breathing in your word. Exhaling and getting even more relaxed and more calm and more comfortable. Knowing that any time you need to, any time you feel uncomfortable, you can think about breathing in this word and feeling the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202031\">that you do now. Exhaling, letting go of the tension. Inhaling peace, calm and relaxation. Then you can use that once you start anxious. When you start to feel worried, give yourself a little break and coming back to this place. Coming back to this peaceful word. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20205\">And let yourself take a few more breaths to memorize this feeling and then when you're ready, holding onto the relaxation. Let yourself come back to the room and own (ph) peace. (pause) OK? Then I will see you in a few weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20207\">CLIENT: Good.

(chuckling) So I do just feel like that's been one thing that I do think is a rule that I made for myself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: That doesn't really work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yea. Or just like maybe it does work. I adhere to it too well. And I'm realizing maybe I should be better about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What would be... so what would be the... if you allowed more flexibility with that rule, what would be the possible negatives?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I think it would be then I wouldn't get as much work done. And then it would be like that feeling of, oh, I hope I'm not going to have to do this some night after he goes to bed when I just want to relax and hang out with Todd (sp?). Or over the weekend when I just want us all to be together <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and I don't want to have to be away from Trae (sp?) doing work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So I wonder how much room there is? Is there some time that you can take for yourself or to do something else and not have it eat into... not have your work eat into other time when you could be like, right, like having alone time with your husband or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: ...having play time as a family. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. I think so. And it's hard to judge right now. Like I'm not... I have the daycare for him three days and then my mom hopefully will be able to do Tuesdays for us but probably just not regularly. But for most weeks, I bet I will have four days. So I think that should be fine but right now <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">I feel like I'm not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Right now is a really hard time to juggle it because you're starting this new phase that you don't know. When you were in classes you had idea already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yea. But I do feel like because this will be time like when I'm just holed up reading and writing, it would be good for me to get out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And I can get some fresh air or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yea. That's a... so that's this sort of like how you... what expectation you set for yourself for how much time, right? Because it's not like writing a paper or getting the assignment done where you know there's a stop point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: When you're doing this part of your work, how many articles you expect to read yourself in a day or how much data analysis you get done. It's such a hard thing to judge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: And so it seems almost trying to figure out what is your balance going to be? How much time do you need to feel kind of healthy or balanced or fulfilled whatever word works for you to meet with a friend, to talk over... whether that's meeting with a friend to talk over work or meeting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">with a friend to talk about the latest episode of whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Or just to check in with one another versus how much time you can really spend alone in a room with your data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Right, yea, yea. And I guess I'll just kind of see how that goes. But I think... and Todd (sp?) has been through this process too. Because I was talking with him and saying, \"I need to figure out a rule that I can practice with and bend a little,\" and telling him that this was an idea that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">had of just figuring out.  I was looking at the gym has a Zumba class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And so maybe once a week I can go do that or something like that. And he was saying that he experienced too that when he was in this analyzing writing phase too it helped him to kind of get out and do something in the middle of the day, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yea. So you might want to try that out and see what it feels like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: But it's almost like... I almost... like I didn't feel nervous but I felt like a twinge of nervousness for today. And I think it was because now like if I... I feel like if I propose this idea, I should probably follow it through. I want to do it. That would be good to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Good. That's one of your rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right. I know. That's true. But I do feel like it would be good for me to go try a Zumba class. But then it's also like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: So what's the nervous part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: That I'll actually do it. I feel like I've had these thoughts before. It would be great for me to go do a class in the middle of the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: So what would be worrisome about actually doing it? I wonder, what's the worry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yea, I think it is just like using up time and not getting as much done. Because I have like a deadline of June... of September 30 is when my full draft is due to my whole committee. So I'm hoping to get a draft to my advisor the very beginning of September or the end of August. So he can read <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">it and then I can make revisions and then I send it out to my whole committee. So there kind of are deadlines imposed already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So I think that's what it is. It's like I don't want to get myself caught.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: They're pretty far out though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yea. I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: They're... so in thinking about giving yourself some flexibility kind of figuring out when do you need to kind of check in on yourself there may be weeks when you use time to go to Zumba, use time to meet with a friend. And there may be weeks where you can't do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: And meet your goals. And so I think the idea of letting your rules be a little bit flexible so they don't... it doesn't mean that all daycare time is always work time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Some weeks it might be all work time and some weeks it might not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: It's interesting because the rules in themselves are not bad. It's when they feel too rigid and they can't change in order to meet changing expectations or changing your external world. Letting your internal rules flex with them...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: ...with how other things change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Right, right. Like I... it's not like if I decided I wanted to try Zumba, I had to go every week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right, exactly. You can let yourself figure out which weeks it makes sense and which weeks it doesn't make as much sense for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yea. I know. I think that would be a good way to think of it, too. But I do think... and that's like something I've wanted to try. I've never done it before.  My friends have done it. My mom has done it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What's stopped you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Just finding the time. I didn't even get a gym membership last school year just because I figured I wouldn't use it. But I did look into it and there are like a... there's a summer membership that you could get. So I could try it and see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yea, it sounds like a good opportunity to try something you've been thinking about and try out what it's like to see if you can allow your rule to change depending on the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yea. And it's funny because it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. But I've even had like a dream that I... and it was like this fuzzy, weird dream. But I think you had suggested in my dream that I go on this camping trip. And I was like, oh, that would be a great thing for me to try. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">on my way to the camping trip, I realized that I didn't pick up Trae (sp?). And I freaked out because I was the one getting him but I couldn't get him that day or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">And I didn't even think anything of it in the morning. And then as I thought about it later, I was like I bet that was kind of signaling to me that I'm like nervous about this idea of like using time. And like talking about it, it's not like, oh my gosh, I can't go to Zumba. I'm so worried about this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">I don't feel like it's like this huge thing weighing over me. But I thought that was funny. It is in the back of my mind of like not feeling totally comfortable with this idea of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: That doing something different would mean that you're losing out on something else if you change your current strategy or change your typical routine that you're going to miss out on either time with Trae (sp?) or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Because that sounds like that is what motivates you. That motivates you to use your time away from him and Todd (sp?) also during the work day. It's afraid of missing out on something with them later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Right. Yea, which in a way I feel like some of it's good because it has made me even more efficient. When I have the time, I just want to get things done.  But I do think it's swung the other way too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: At the expense of something else, yea. And I think... and that's probably true with most weeks. That there is obviously an importance and there's... you put them in place because they made sense and were good for you at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: And the only problem is when the get too rigid or when you're extending a rule that used to make a lot of sense for your former life maybe but doesn't necessarily make as much sense now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: And feeling like you need to stick to the rule rather than stick to figuring out what actually works for best for everybody right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yea. So I think thinking of this as not a rule that I'm going to Zumba either but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: ...just try it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: It doesn't... you don't have to swing in the opposite direction to make another really rigid rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: That the new rule is... what would we name the new rule?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Well, I think it's the idea... like that it is OK to just do something for myself. That's when I think during that time I don't like to do that.  I wanted to just use that time for work time so that I'm not taking away time from Trae (sp?). So I think it is loosening up to let myself to have some time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: I... if like thinking about it in a visuals help kind of thinking about the pie chart. Like what is in there. So clearly it sounds like there's time with Trae (sp?) in there. There's getting work done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: There's having some time alone with Todd (sp?) at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: How much of the space is there for Rachel (sp?)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yea. I mean, I don't... not a lot at all. And once in a while I'll meet up with a friend or something that... and we have... but a lot of times it's with Trae (sp?). We meet up with friends all the time when I'm home with him and we've got friends in the neighborhood that we'll meet up with. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">But yea, total like... without Trae (sp?) or without Todd (sp?), I feel like I don't have a lot of that. But I also don't know how much of that I really want either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, so do you... how would you know you had enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yea, I don't know. But I think it would be just like not feeling... like when I do have those moments of like, oh, I just want to get my hair cut and I don't have time for that. Or silly things that you just do for yourself that you don't have time to do. Maybe not feeling that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right, right. Not feeling like there is no time to do them. And also maybe not feeling like they're silly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yea, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Would you die if didn't get a haircut? Probably not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Will you feel better...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: ...if you could... if you had time to do things like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: It sounds like yea. There are times when you felt kind of stressed by the fact that you felt... feeling like you have something you want to do and not able to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So that's self-care. It's not that silly. That's actually fairly important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And so having enough space to be devoted to stuff like that overall.  Maybe not every day, maybe not every week but overall feeling like there's enough space there to do things. Like meet up with a friend without also being responsible for making sure that Trae (sp?) is OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Because there is that difference of being responsible to somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: And soon they get older and understand everything you say. The conversations are geared so much differently when there's grownups there and kids there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Who can really listen and yea, pick up on what you're saying. Yea. But Todd (sp?) and I have talked about that because once in a while he'll meet up with his guy friends for a drink or something after Trae (sp?) is asleep. And we said, like it's funny that when I meet up with my girlfriends, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">it's always with the babies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: And even sometimes like when we meet with my best friend Stephanie (sp?) who's down in Duxbury, we'll go down and then Todd (sp?) and her husband, Ethan (sp?) will go play golf or something and we'll be able...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Stay home with the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Which is great. That's... it's... we love having our babies play together and we have fun.  But it is funny that it's like a lot of my friend time and seeing my friends is with our kids which is fun but it just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: But it's not everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: Totally girl time to just... yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And so having a little bit of that is maybe also... maybe you're missing out on a little bit of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And maybe you don't necessarily want a ton of it. But it sounds like having some of it sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Have you noticed... is it... so I mean, clearly there's a difference in having or not having Trae (sp?). But a shift in your relationship with Todd (sp?) because that sounds like a very typical gender divide. And I'm not sure if that's how it felt before you had Trae (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yea. But I think he's so helpful and with so many things that I feel like stereotypically would be like the woman would be doing in the relationship that he's so helpful with that. That's kind of one of the few things that I actually do notice because I do feel like that is like a very stereotypical <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">thing. But otherwise I think we've gotten into...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: And part of it might be up until fairly recently you were breastfeeding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yea. I just went off of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: So if you went off to go play 18 holes of golf, it requires a little bit more planning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:16).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yea. But I think it also helped. Like the other way that I think Todd (sp?) always wanted to feel really useful when I was nursing Trae (sp?). So he would do the laundry or he would be doing the dishes or something. So he's so helpful with all of that that I don't really feel like that we go <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">along those divides and a lot of things and sometimes too helpful like that. I think we've talked about that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yea, you felt guilty almost not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yea. I feel like he sometimes tries to do everything. But I think that that has gotten a little better. You just don't realize how much time goes into breastfeeding. And now that... and pumping too. And now that a lot of that has gone, it feels better. Yea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I'm glad you're settling into it sounds like a more comfortable pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Sometimes just sort of massaging a little bit to see if you can find a little bit more flexibility for yourself either with him or using daycare time doesn't necessarily all need to be hard core work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: Right, yea. And I even... there was one of our... one mom who I got to know who also sends her kid to the same daycare. And she came the other day in her workout clothes. I could tell she had come from the gym and I was like, I should be doing that. So I think that is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: Or I could, yea, yea. But that would be my time to do something like that. And I think that's what gave me the idea of just try... if I wanted to try that out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yea. So your... the time you have in daycare can be time to do things for yourself or things for work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yea, it'd be interesting to see how you can arrange it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: And just even start to notice if you have other rules set up for yourself that don't work all the time or create some kind of distress rather than being helpful. Rules would be great if they're actually really helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Rather than feeling like they're restricting you or impeding upon something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yea. Yea, because I feel like I've also experienced that where they go too far. Like when I would have to read before bed. That became like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: It became a rule, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: ...too restrictive of a rule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Where it got developed to be something that was helpful like a habit perhaps. And then became a rule that couldn't be broken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Even when it would make sense necessarily to break it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Right, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20118-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20118-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Does... are there any rules that people have for you that don't work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: I don't think so. But it is funny. I even noticed... because I've been thinking about this a lot.  And when I go to do my observations at the school, you have to sign in and sign out as you're leaving. And so it just like is a log of pages and pages of people signing in the time. And I noticed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D1\">that I'm one of like... probably the only person that signs out. I can look through the pages. I looked the other day. And the only person who had signed out on like three pages in a row was me. (chuckling) And so I was laughing kind of thinking like I definitely am a rule follower. I think that is a good way...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: So when you noticed that, so then you said you were laughing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: So what went along with that? What were you feeling as you were laughing as you noticed that? What were you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: Well, part of me was kind of surprised that other people didn't do that. But then I know I just... I don't know if it made me think I thought too much about it but just kind of thinking that that was very symbolic of my personality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yea, your rule following. Yea, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: And there was one day where I didn't sign the book. And I was then... I left really late that day. I was the next person to sign in on the morning and I saw that I hadn't. So I filled in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Then you filled in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yea. (chuckling) And then I was like, oh, was that the time that I left? I wanted it to be accurate even. But yea, I don't know. I think it... I think that was very symbolic of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yea, I think it's a really nice visual to have to remind of, OK, this might not be the degree to which everybody follows rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: And figuring out when is it really important and when is it not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: So I mean, I can almost imagine that if you had realized that you hadn't signed out, that that's something you would've worried a little bit about at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: And probably been able to let go of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: But you would have really noticed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: Whereas clearly lots of other people are not signing out on a regular basis and don't even know or know but don't care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: Yea, when I saw that I hadn't, I was surprised that I didn't think of that.  Like I feel like that would've been something too. That I would've wanted to just run back in and sign out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: But I think a little piece of it is with Trae (sp?), like if this... and I don't know why I think this. Because his daycare doesn't even know what school I'm at where I'm doing my research. But I think a little piece of it was if anyone needed to track down where I was, like I'm signing in, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D1\">they know I'm in the building and I'm signing out, they know I've left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: So I wonder if a little teeny piece of that was just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">THERAPIST: Do you also sign him in and out of daycare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: No, we don't have to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">CLIENT: Because it's a tiny little home daycare. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yea. I think that's actually...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">THERAPIST: So you're really just in the habit of it perhaps or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT: I know, yea. But his daycare is very relaxed and they hardly have any rules. Do you know what I mean? I feel like that's been a really good thing for me that we're not getting the little slips of paper every day that are documenting everything with him. And at first that kind of bugged me.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201611\">I wanted to know more of what was going on. But in a way I think that that's been really helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20160-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20160-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: You've gotten used to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: ...that I don't know every little thing and I can just be sure that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">THERAPIST: That you can trust that he's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">CLIENT: ...they're doing fine and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: ...that he's OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Because you pick him up every day and he's OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">CLIENT: Yea. Because I could see my... like I definitely wanted that at the beginning but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yea, so you saw that you can actually be more flexible and you can be more comfortable with not knowing not being in controlling and not knowing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: That's a good way to stretch yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: Right. And we joke because they primarily... they only speak French with Trae (sp?) during the day which we love. And I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yea, he's really going to learn that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yea, like there are some of the older kids who both their parents don't know any French but they're running around... like when we pick him up speaking French.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Sure, he'll pick it up. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: So we've loved that. But it's funny because there is a little bit even of like a communication barrier. When we pick him up, like they are fine and he can communicate to us what he's done.  But we don't get those little details of exactly when he went down for a nap and when he woke up. She's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201811\">like, \"Oh, he slept about two hours.\" But I think all of that really did bug me at the beginning. I really was craving that detail. And now I am OK with it. So I think that that's all been like helpful to know... we joke that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: Did you choose that going in? Did you know that it was going to be less structured and less...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: No, no. I mean, we knew it wasn't going to have the protocols and things that a center would need to have which we liked. We liked just having like a little... that just felt like a little more personalized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: Then we did visit just one center. So we kind of liked that aspect of it. That it was a little bit looser. But I think at the beginning if I knew... like I talked to one of my friends who sends their child there. And she said, \"Oh, you do get the little slips of paper home.\" And that comforted <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201891\">me thinking, \"Oh good, I'll know what he did all day.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">THERAPIST: And then it wasn't like that anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yea, at like the first little bit they did. But then it dropped off. But it... I think that has been good for me to just kind of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yea, it's been good to kind of push your boundaries and show... and have experience that it is... that it's been positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Because it's pushing your boundaries and getting you used to being uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: But being a little bit uncomfortable and it's been a positive outcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: And so you can kind of look back on that as you push yourself to try loosening some of your own rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: And think that like, \"OK, it was uncomfortable at first, but I actually enjoyed the outcome.\" And so kind of keeping that in the back of your mind as you do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2019E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Right, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Anything else we should be catching up on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: I think that was everything. That was... I have been thinking about it a lot. Just trying to be more aware of what the rules are that I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yea. So I encourage you to keep that up just kind of noticing when you feel like there is a rule that you're noticing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: And only try to break one at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yea, that's a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: (chuckling) So that you don't feel like you're losing all your anchors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: I know we haven't done relaxation in a while. So I stop us and wondered if you wanted to do some today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yea, that would be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: So let's schedule because I don't know if we have anything on the books. And then give you some time to do some meditation. (pause) (inaudible at 00:22:26) for you. So am I correct? I didn't see you but then sometimes when I don't look on normal... on a day that maybe we had scheduled unusually? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yea. I'm not sure that we had another time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Yea, we may actually not have. So when works... you have lots of flexibility now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: I know. (chuckling) Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: So how... when do you want to come back? Two weeks again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: That... yea. That would be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: OK. So that would put us on Monday the 8th. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: Or actually that is the only week where I won't have a lot of flexibility because I'm helping with a conference that week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: OK. So that week I have time just Monday and Tuesday. But I could also... we could push it off a week or we could meet on Friday. Oh no, we can't. That's Friday the 5th. So we... I have time Monday, Tuesday if anything works for you or we could move to maybe the 15th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: The 15th will probably be best because that's like it's an all-day institute. So it might be hard to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: So I can do anytime between... I have a 10:30, an 11:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: 10:30 would work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: All right, let's do that. (pause) Can we make it 10:40?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: And then we'll meet right up until 11:30. I just... the train schedule I might not be here right at 10:30. At the moment I don't have a 9:30. If I do, then it's no problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Otherwise I'll try to stay home and get something done for an extra half hour. (pause) And then... so we would normal do two weeks but that actually that last week of July is my vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: Oh nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: So we could do either Monday the 5th or we can meet Friday the 26th if you want to keep it closer to two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: I won't... so Fridays will be my day home with Trae (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: So I won't have anyone to watch him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: And I know now I definitely can't bring him with me. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: No, he's too old for that. He will want the attention but... so I could do Tuesday the 23rd or we could do the 5th again, Monday the 5th. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: I know the 5th will work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: OK. You want to do the 10:30 or 10:40 again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT: So that... yea, 10:40 will be great on Monday the 5th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: And that will also be the... so August starts your new insurance year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: Oh OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: And so I don't know where we are in session count. I haven't actually looked on that. But we know we're safe then.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2240490\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\">CLIENT: Yea, that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">THERAPIST: And I will look at that today just in case you need to be aware of changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">CLIENT: Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">THERAPIST: I haven't actually looked at that. (pause) Let's give you a few minutes to do some deep breathing. (pause) And so let yourself get comfortable. You can close your eyes. Begin to take some deep breaths at your pace. (pause) Let yourself take full inhales and exhales.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">Beginning to relax your body. Letting yourself clear your mind. (pause) Taking a moment to notice anything that feels tight, tense or uncomfortable. Thinking about taking a deep breath into those spaces. And as you exhale let go of the tension. Letting your muscles relax. Thinking about letting the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD1\">chair doing the work holding up the weight of your body. Let the floor hold the weight of your legs and feet. Noticing the thoughts that are stuck in your head. Acknowledging them and then letting them go for now and then float away knowing you can hold onto important things later. And now letting your <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD2\">mind be clear. Letting your body relax.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">Again, scanning your body and noticing any place that feels tight or uncomfortable. If there is a place that's hard, to let go of the tension. Think about tightening that space up even more on your next inhale and then relaxing fully as you exhale. Repeating that process as many times as you need to. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF1\">Scanning your body and noticing a tight space. Tensing as you inhale, relaxing as you exhale. Letting yourself become more relaxed with each breath.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">Perhaps letting yourself drift away to place where you are fully relaxed. (pause) Imagining the details of that place and letting yourself get immersed in every tiny detail. Noticing what it feels like to be there. What it feels like in your body. What it feels like emotionally. (pause) Let yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202011\">kind of soak up all the calm and peace that surrounds you there. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20203\">Maybe attaching a word to this feeling or place that you have right now. Breathing in your word. Exhaling and getting even more relaxed and more calm and more comfortable. Knowing that any time you need to, any time you feel uncomfortable, you can think about breathing in this word and feeling the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202031\">that you do now. Exhaling, letting go of the tension. Inhaling peace, calm and relaxation. Then you can use that once you start anxious. When you start to feel worried, give yourself a little break and coming back to this place. Coming back to this peaceful word. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20205\">And let yourself take a few more breaths to memorize this feeling and then when you're ready, holding onto the relaxation. Let yourself come back to the room and own (ph) peace. (pause) OK? Then I will see you in a few weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20207\">CLIENT: Good. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">THERAPIST: You're very welcome. (pause) Take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020B\">CLIENT: You too, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
