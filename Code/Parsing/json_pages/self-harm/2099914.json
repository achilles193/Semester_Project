I'm also wearing a sweatshirt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:12)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Hey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Hey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: So I was pretty anxious about therapy, which is unfortunate because, you know, this isn't something I want to be anxious about. Then I got in here and it's like, I don't know, it just is a safe place at this point, so it's like being here and I kind of calmed down. It was like, \"Okay, it's going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">to be fine.\" (Pause) But, yeah, I was anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 01:01)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: You know, about everything. (inaudible 01:10) (Laughter) About at least a year ago, probably, maybe two years, I told James's advisor's wife that I would read and mark up and edit a novel that I think her sister had written. Either she or her sister had written, because she sent me a copy of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">it, and then I forget to do it. And I forgot about it entirely until a few days ago. Then I remembered, and been feeling horrible about it ever since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: When did she send it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: A long time ago. (Laughter) Like, at least a year ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 01:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So, I don't know. I mean, I've got time to do it now. And I sort of am in a position where there's less to do during the day, and there's less that I can do in terms of, like, looking for tutoring jobs and looking for teaching jobs, than there is time in the day. So it would be good to do, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">I don't know if it would be useful to her at this point. I'm a little embarrassed to get in contact with her (inaudible 02:38). It's a romance novel. This all started because I was at, like, a party at Kevin's house and I was talking with his wife about really liking romance novels. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: You see where that got you? (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yep. Yeah, I do actually. I can read about two in a row, and then I want to shoot myself. (Laughter) They're really fun, up until that point. I've been reading Proust (sp?) for the last few days. It's a lot better than I expected it to be, actually. Or rather, a lot more fun. You know, I always <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">fall for this, like, people talk about great writers and you expect them to be really boring. It's like, no, people like (laughter) these people for a reason. But yeah, it's really funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I can't help it. I remember, like, I had a bit of experience with that when I was in middle school and we were reading a play. This is, like, the first time (inaudible 03:57). And at the beginning of the play, there's, like, sexual innuendos, [if you remember] (ph), at the beginning of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">(inaudible 04:13) and one of the kids in the class, one of the boys, started laughing. And (inaudible 04:17). The teacher said, \"What's so funny?\" and he wouldn't say. And, you know, (laughter) he knew that he got it, but he didn't know the author meant it, you know. (Laughter) So the teacher kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">figured that out and was like, \"No, he meant it,\" you know. Females do that. (inaudible 04:37) and they're doing it on stage. And, like, there was sort of this moment like, \"Oh.\" (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yep. Yeah. Yeah. They're sort of fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: No, I think I had kind of the same experience with that exact same scene.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I think we read, like, an abridged version. And then we watched the (pause) So it's really, really good but, like, there's kind of lot of nudity. (Laughter) I just remember the teacher, like, trying to kind of, like, fast forward through the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">nude scenes. But, like, the actress, like, her mad scene, she's nude in it. And so, it was like, we kind of have to watch that. And, like, you don't see very much. I think she was just like, \"Oh, whatever. It's fine.\" (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: James told me yesterday he thinks I should be a writer. Just sort of like, \"Okay. [In this field] (ph) that it's even harder to get [paid in] (ph).\" (laughter) I wanted to be a writer for a long time. I think I decided in college that I was just a better reader than a writer and just kind of stopped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: This is writing fiction or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. I read a lot of plays in college. (inaudible 08:14) I think I just impressed James because I've been able to guess the storyline in every Friends episode.

Not 15 years ago, but a long time ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I never read it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Okay. (Laughter) Well, that's good. You know, that's John Irving. Mostly, it's just really weird. (Laughter) But good. The lead character, who's one of there's, like, this family, and one of the siblings, she's a dwarf. Like, she's very short. And she wants to be a writer. And so, she'll just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">like, sit in her room all day and type. And they say, \"What are you doing?\" And she says, \"I'm trying to grow.\" (Laughter) I think she kills herself at the end of the book. And she's, like, written a couple of novels and neither of them have been successful or really any good. And what the narrator <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">says is that he thinks in the end maybe she was just a really great reader, and not a writer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">That's one of those things that's kind of gotten stuck into my head, but I know they're not the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: [So I wish James hadn't said that to me] (ph).

(Long pause) You know, I'm a decent singer and a decent actor. And I never really had much training in either. More in acting than singing. But then, like, eventually you get to the point where, like, you have to have training if you're going to be professional at it. And I kind of say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">\"Well, I guess I'm just not that good of an actor.\" I just stop doing it. That, and [the department] (ph). I mean, the reason why I didn't have much training was because the acting department was terrible. Like, there wasn't any training to be had at Texas A&amp;M. But, you know, so I just stopped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">You know, I've always thought I was just not good at math and science, and working with these girls on algebra, I'm like, \"Oh, no. you're pretty good at it.

(Pause) (inaudible 21:45) (Pause) I'm just feeling like I can't work with myself. Like I don't want to be in my body, that I can't stand being the person that I am.

And in some ways, it's really not, because I feel like, well, if I (pause) if I know that (pause) feeling terrible about myself and, you know, wanting to hurt myself and wanting to kill myself is partly something that I do because it's easier than actually dealing with things, then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D3\">shouldn't fall for that.

(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: You know, you're so often up against, in this case, like, (inaudible 25:44) (pause) impossible demands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: They're not impossible for other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: That one is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I do. Thanks (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: You're not going to answer this, but so if understanding how it works isn't [just saying that] (ph), \"Oh, help me get out of this,\" what is? (Laughter) Is that a \"you're right, I'm not going to answer that\" face? (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: No, no, I'm smiling because (inaudible 26:51). (Laughter) I don't mind. I can answer that. The first part of the answer is, whatever it is, it's something that makes those things easier to do or harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Let's see. Well (pause), so this is probably not a bad example. (Long pause) Okay, so (pause) I may get some of this wrong, but it's sort of, like, I'm going to bend (ph) around to try to answer your question a little bit (ph). I imagine part of why you were nervous to come today is because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">of burning yourself on the stove yesterday and mentioning it might come up. (inaudible 28:49) have you been doing that regularly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: It wasn't the first time. (Pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Okay, so let me back off of that, and I will ask you more about that (inaudible 29:09). One of the things, then should we talk about that now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: No, it's okay. I mean, I really don't want to talk about it. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Okay. All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: If we're going to need to talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: No, we have time. (inaudible 29:30) but we will have time. I think one of the things that (inaudible 29:38) the kind of thing you were just saying. Having an idea, like, imaging that I think that by having some insight, like you described, you should be able to act differently. And so you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">kind of walk around with that (inaudible 30:03) on your head, which it is sort of a typical (inaudible 30:07) that the other person is making an impossible demand of you. And when it's overwhelming, you're trapped. You know, it totally traps you, you know, in that (inaudible 30:19) And that's (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF2\">30:20) how this works, and you can't do it, you're kind of screwed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099914\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">I mean, like, either you say it doesn't work and then there's losing me or the possibility of help of this kind. Or you're like, \"Well, it's your fault,\" and then there's something the matter with you. And that just makes you feel worse and more like you'd rather kill yourself anyway. But then, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">know, we talk about it and it turns out that's actually not what I expect or how I think about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Well, [to be clear] (ph), I pretty much already know. I do know that. I just (inaudible 31:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Sure. And, like, you know, then it turns out, you know, you're not such an impossible situation anymore. At least in terms of this kind, you know, there's not at least this one impossible demand on you. It's sort of, like, chipping away a little at the sort of (pause) impossibility. Impossibility. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">(inaudible 31:46). Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Somewhere (ph) like I can't remember what I was you know, in a week or sorry. A week or two ago, I kind of come in and just, like, fall apart and, you know, say everything is horrible, and you kind of very gently say, \"You're sort of catastrophizing here. You're sort of making things into <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">this big, global thing, and it's not this big, global thing.\" Is that what you're talking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: That would be another instance, yeah, of (pause) yeah, that one, it's a little complicated, in a way, to me. But yeah, sure, something like that. I mean, I think it's complicated because I think there's a way you're trying to convince both of us that things are that bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And probably for some important reasons, but I think, I guess basically, it works fine as an example in that you felt relief, I think, when I said, you know, it's not like that, more so than you felt threatened by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, there are other sort of ways or aspects to how this works, but that's fine, I think. Sure. I mean, there's something a little more schematic (ph) about it, but there are sort of emotional things that keep these sorts of, you know, fantasies in play. So one, I think, is just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">recognizing those fantasies in the first place and not necessarily the way things are in the world. And then another is dealing with the sort of feeling bitter (ph) being avoided or [voided off] (ph) through their use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: I see. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Sure. (Pause) So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I told, you know, myself and other people that I wasn't going to hurt myself anymore. And (pause) I've been doing, like, over time rationalizing. You know, sort of saying, \"Well, it doesn't leave a mark. It's not really hurting myself, right?\" (Sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: What have you been doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Like, pinching myself and digging my nails into my palms. And (pause) I burnt myself accidentally a while back, and it occurred to me that burn scars go away. You know, and I still have a lot of scars on my legs (inaudible 35:48). James's family takes a vacation to the beach every summer. It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">unclear what's going to happen there. You know, it's not like I mean, the thyroid (ph) scar (inaudible 36:12) I got stitches, and now you can't even see it. (inaudible 36:16) (Long pause) I am glad to be talking about with you about it now because I haven't been doing it very often, but it's getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF2\">more frequent, and it's getting worse (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099914\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You mean how much you're burning yourself (inaudible 37:06)? Like, what are you doing? Are you touching your arm against the stove?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (inaudible 37:19)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Against the stove itself or against a hot pot or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Against, like, a hot pot or, you know, like an electric kettle that gets really hot. Yeah. And, like, the water in our apartment gets really, really hot. You know, like when I wash my hands sometimes, I do that. (Long pause) But it doesn't help very much. But it helps enough for me to (inaudible 38:08).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: [Do you have] (ph) second-degree burns from it?

Like, everyday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: [Have you done it today] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: I did it a couple of times yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Helps with the anxiety?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: Again (ph), it helped some, but it's not very much. (inaudible 39:10) I feel like I remember it helping more (inaudible 39:25). Which I guess is good. (inaudible 39:34)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess one thing that strikes me too is that so much more of this now is about anxiety, rather than more kind of depressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's starting to kind of blend together. Like, I get anxious, and then that turns into thinking terrible things about myself, as opposed to being sad, and that turning into thinking terrible things about myself. But, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Does it seem like this is what worried you about coming in, that this was maybe going to come up today?

I feel like it will be easier for me, but (pause) I mean you know, so yesterday, I really wasn't doing very well, but when I was here, I wasn't thinking about that at all, and it was like it was completely gone in some ways.
