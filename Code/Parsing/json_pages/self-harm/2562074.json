I\u2019ll try and do that this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Okay. This day is turning into an I-just-don\u2019t-sleep-well-on-Sunday-night thing. I don\u2019t know what it is. I theoretically got enough sleep last night, but I woke up every two hours all night. That\u2019s not really normal for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Couple\u2019s therapy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: That\u2019s my thought. (laughs) Like I just stress out about it. That\u2019s the best I can come up with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Although I understand that\u2019s not always how stress affects you.  It doesn\u2019t usually affect your sleep that way from what I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe it\u2019s because we go early in the morning. The appointment is at 8:15, so we get up and then go. (pause) One of the main reasons that I go to church is that it\u2019s sort of helps me not keep such a tight hold on myself. I can relax a little bit; and sometimes that ends up being very joyful <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">and then sometimes I\u2019m like oh, actually I\u2019m just really sad.  (chuckles) It\u2019s hard to explain to James. Some days I come home from church and I\u2019m clearly really, really sad and it\u2019s sort of hard to explain that that doesn\u2019t mean that church is bad. (laughs) (pause) I think I\u2019m just feeling really tired. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">(crying) Like I said the other day, I\u2019m wanting to give up [provisionally] (ph?) (pause)  There\u2019s not really anywhere I can go with that. (crying) (pause) James, for understandable reasons, gets very, very anxious and upset to see me feeling helpless and defeated. I\u2019m trying to live as though I believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">that I\u2019m going to get better, but I don\u2019t always believe that I\u2019m going to. (pause) I still want to keep trying. (crying) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">One of the things he talked about in couple\u2019s therapy was this idea that, in some ways, I\u2019m sort of split between the part of me that just wants to give up and is really self-defeating and the part of me that\u2019s planning for the future and figuring out the next thing and excited about what the next thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">will be and will move forward.  I think it\u2019s certainly helpful for me to think about it in that way as this sort of divided self. I think it\u2019s really helpful for James to see it in that way. I think it made sense to him and sort of helps him interpret some things that I do. I\u2019m not always very consistent, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">but I also am uncomfortable with the idea of taking a big chunk of who I am and saying that I don\u2019t want that to be part of me anymore or that I am against this part of myself. It just feels not right to me. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s the part that felt like everybody else, and often you, have been against to begin with, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. (pause)  But I feel like trying to silence that voice in my head is ineffective. When I try to silence that voice in my head I end up feeling like I am silenced. (crying) I don\u2019t want to be that (inaudible at 00:08:38). (crying) (long pause)  I need new glasses. (laughs) These <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">are from two prescriptions ago and I realized that James cannot tell the difference between these glasses and the ones I wore right before that and the ones I wore before that. But to me, they\u2019re just the totally wrong shape. (laughs)  (pause) My eyelashes brush up against the lens and if I\u2019ve been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">crying it\u2019s like I have fuzzy lenses. Oh, well. (pause)  It feels hard right now. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562074\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I had a thought about the glasses, of course, and what I wondered is if you might have just been upset about not wanting to look at things in that more undefeated\/feeling hopeless sort of way. I could imagine that having some contact with that actually is a way of taking care of yourself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">as much as it is sort of about not caring about taking care of anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I thought about the glasses. I also felt like you\u2019re doing something that you kind of need to do for yourself that James doesn\u2019t get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It feels like I am owning up to it and that\u2019s weirdly helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s also scary because I don\u2019t ever quite trust that I\u2019m going to come out the other side. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That part sometimes \u2013 maybe a lot of times \u2013 you really want it just to be done, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I sort of theoretically have the sense that that\u2019s just sort of wanting to give up and be done is part of the cycle or is part of how it goes for me; or that I\u2019ll feel like that for a while and then I\u2019ll wake up the next day and I don\u2019t feel like that anymore.  Something else will distract me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">and I won\u2019t feel like that anymore and then it makes it easier to get through if I pay attention to it and sort of name it, as opposed to trying not to acknowledge it\u2019s there. That\u2019s the sense that I have of it, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that. (laughs) I don\u2019t know. Yeah, it feels like the distance between <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">me and killing myself is very short and I know that it\u2019s probably not or I probably already would have done it, but it\u2019s really scary.  I don\u2019t really know what to tell James about it because it\u2019s hard for me to ask him to trust that that distance is not so short when I don\u2019t trust it. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">There\u2019s just no space for . . . When I feel like that there\u2019s nowhere I can go, (pause) (sniffling) which is a temporary unsolvable problem.  We need to move to a bigger apartment eventually. (pause) It\u2019s not really getting easier for me to be sad in front of other people (pause) and maybe especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">James.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I guess what I was thinking about is I don\u2019t think you\u2019re all that comfortable feeling that way in any space \u2013 maybe when you\u2019re by yourself most of all \u2013 hopeless and feeling like you want to kill yourself. Maybe other things, too, that I don\u2019t know about, but I think your (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">00:22:57) like just not something you can talk to people about and that people immediately have a sort of alienating and critical response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, that definitely has been my experience. (pause) I think it\u2019s true that even by myself it\u2019s hard to be there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019re so scared. In a way, I think what you want is somebody there with you with it, but that\u2019s not going to work either. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s very strange to have this sort of [demotion] (ph?) or experience that not only really scares people, but is sort of consistently seen as this beyond the pale sort of thing.  Be like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s just a normal part of my life. That\u2019s just how my internal space is a lot of the time.\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">don\u2019t really tell people that. I tell people most things. (laughs) (pause)  I feel like I sort of talk a big game about uncertainty and vulnerability and it seems really hard. (pause) I feel like there are a couple of hour stretches where I can say that I don\u2019t know whether I am going to kill myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">or not and I can still live with that and have my life, even though that\u2019s the case. Then that sort of shuts down or collapses in on itself. That mental exercise is just too much to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562074\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I see. That part is (inaudible at 00:27:00) again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.  (pause) Then I\u2019m either in this space where I think, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m going to kill myself or not, so I just can\u2019t live. I just can\u2019t have a life.\u201d And then the other side of me is like, \u201cI have to just keep moving forward and just not pay attention to that or not tolerate that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">idea.\u201d Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yes. (long pause) [I would imagine the hardest part of that is the first part of that when you were more worried about not being clear about the first part, where there is a part of you that the uncertainty is just too unbearable to live with.] (ph?) You just want it to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah.  (pause) I don\u2019t know exactly why I\u2019m thinking about this, but one of the truisms that people write a lot about suicide is that nobody who attempts suicide actually wants to die \u2013 it\u2019s something else \u2013 and I find that very frustrating. I see the point, but I think that something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">the phrasing makes it very easy to trivialize. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I imagine it comes across as, in a way, in a funny way, kind of defensive. There is no REAL suicidality, people not wanting to think about how it could be bad enough that you really want to die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I feel like it\u2019s not always there usually, that I actually want to die or be dead, but I feel like I\u2019ve definitely been there; and I can tell the difference. (chuckles)  (long pause)  It feels like I want this one thing that is pretty simple and instead, I just have to do all these other things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">that are really complicated. I get that, but I also just sort of don\u2019t. (chuckles) I understand that, but it doesn\u2019t make me not want to be dead. Why can\u2019t I just do this really simple thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: When you say you understand that . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: That I have to do all of the complicated things to make me not want to kill myself anymore. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  Were you stepping into that pretty quickly to reassure me that you understand that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. I think it\u2019s pretty possible. (crying) (long pause)  I feel like a little kid in that when you\u2019re old enough to follow the reasoning but not old enough to care. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not just little kids, too. (both laugh) No, I know what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: No, no. You\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What I mean is you probably (inaudible at 00:36:56) just feel supported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess that that comment, too, like the one that may have been about your reassuring me, also seems a little like you\u2019re talking to someone to whom it\u2019s important to make clear that you feel the wrong way, but you see it the right way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562074\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(laughs) (pause) It\u2019s really hard for me to be okay with it and pay attention to the part of me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">doesn\u2019t care about the reasoning.
