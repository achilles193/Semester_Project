(pause) I don\u2019t know what the rest of the day\u2019s schedules are like, but they usually \u2013 that team\u2019s usually on the short-term unit like early in the morning, at like 8:15 to 10 maybe.

(pause) You know I\u2019m pretty anxious about being out in some ways; I\u2019m pretty anxious about like what happens next; how this is affecting James. And he\u2019s worried about me, and that makes me worried; we\u2019re just worrying over there. (chuckle) (pause) Yeah. (pause) [I don\u2019t have the answer <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">to like start talking] (ph).

Like maybe I just need to stop managing them so much. (pause) I came in, you know, I just sort of met with the psychiatrist there; Dr. (Bell) (sp?); 20 minutes at a time; she was coming into the scene last year, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">she\u2019s \u2013 I think she\u2019s very good. She doesn\u2019t really pull punches. So like in a longer term situation that would have been a problem. And I\u2019m like, so it would go to me whether, and I\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, I feel like she\u2019s going to yell at me about something, and I don\u2019t feel like I have control over what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">that is.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: But basically, (pause) I was like, \u201cYou know, I feel better; I think I feel pretty safe.\u201d And she was like, \u201cYou\u2019re not really practicing anything.\u201d And she just sort of poked me until I started crying a lot, and then she was, yeah. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I mean it helped; it was like she was trying to do what you do, but she only had 20 minutes. So she didn\u2019t really have time to f*** around. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Which day was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: That was on Friday I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: So I spent a lot of the weekend just sort of trying to sit with exact, which I think helped. (pause) But that\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want things to just go back to the way they were. (pause) Or to the way they have been recently. (pause)  (pause) It seems like [two hours] (ph) a day (pause) I was like so tired all the time. I would (sigh) (pause) I don\u2019t it was so much like avoiding feeling the things; it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">I would deal with things for about half an hour, and then that would be so tiring, that I would just like be done (chuckle) for the next several hours. (chuckle) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">I then I was (tired) (ph) all week; I\u2019d have trouble falling asleep, or I\u2019d wake up and not be able to get back to sleep. You know, I had a roommate who snored, so that (overlapping voices). But, yeah.

(pause) Well definitely the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: The consensus?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: The consensus (chuckle) (pause) I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what the issue was.  (pause) I\u2019m really anxious about what\u2019s going to happen with James. I don\u2019t know, you know, if sort of Tristan or James could stop handling it. But like now is the point where he stops having to do a good job handling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">it. So it\u2019s sort of seeing where he is. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">It\u2019s hard because it\u2019s such a different atmosphere. Like it\u2019s \u2013 (pause) in some ways, I feel like this thing that I \u2013 the things that were difficult for me are sort of very different in that hospital setting. And that they\u2019re \u2013 I sort of resolved those, and then like leave, and now there\u2019s this new <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">set of problems. And in some ways, the problems don\u2019t carry over that well. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">So I spent a lot of the time there sort of, I mean talking to people about like the self-injury, because it was surprisingly hard for me to be in a situation where I couldn\u2019t self-injure. Like I was sort of taken back by how big of deal that was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: And like that\u2019s something that they had the resources to deal with, and they like to talk about \u2013 yeah. So I feel like that was helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Good. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I also feel like I\u2019ve talked about that, is why I\u2019m not talking about the suicide. But I don\u2019t know. [Sounds good] (ph). (pause) But I wondered like (pause) you know, I always feel like they\u2019re very separate things, but I think that they feed into each other really. (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">So, (pause) I\u2019m trying to start to figure out the rest of the week. Like do I go back to work tomorrow? But I don\u2019t know; I feel like I should go back to work tomorrow, but it\u2019s also sort of daunting to daunting to like, you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay yeah, that\u2019s great. Now start the work week.\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: If it would be my choice, I\u2019d say yeah, but I\u2019m certainly happy that you have the thoughts I have about it. I mean like in other words, usually I don\u2019t (inaudible at 00:10:51); and even when I have, I think you pretty much have (laughter) (overlapping voices) anyway. I\u2019m not (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">00:10:59) like that. But if I had thoughts about (overlapping voices) \u2013 yeah. I don\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t yet, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I really don\u2019t take your advice; no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t really give into you that many times, but I remember the times you have \u2013 I have sort of \u2013 I remember it being clear that you didn\u2019t \u2013 I mean in other words, like you made it clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I often remember what it was about, sort of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I remember it was like you gave me advice about tutoring at some point. And I was just like, that\u2019s a good idea. And then didn\u2019t really do it. (pause) Yeah, because I really like want you to give me advice all the time, but apparently I don\u2019t want to take it. (laughter) (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">I feel like I have a lot of questions that I wanted to ask you about. (pause) I can\u2019t remember what they are. (pause) It\u2019s about the future. (pause) But I can\u2019t remember what they are, and I (inaudible at 00:12:54), and I don\u2019t whether they\u2019re questions that I would tell you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562274\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">I have a question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: What would a good outcome look like for me? (pause) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Okay, so let me be clear up front that I\u2019m going to interpret the question instead of answering that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, not that was clear all right. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: (overlapping laughter) I just don\u2019t want to (object) (ph) that that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, you know, if you\u2019ve got the question. But (pause) this is \u2013 a bunch of this is making me think about your use of the hospital as a [rest pit] (ph). I mean there\u2019s been the least of it in which like you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">getting sort of what I imagine is a, like in a way, I have more concrete kind of help around the self-injury stuff. In which, I assume that \u2013 but maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I imagine that that\u2019s where you meant you had thought of questions -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: you wanted to ask me about. Which I know that\u2019s something you do all the time, and I just don\u2019t hear about it. But I \u2013 at least you don\u2019t tend to bring it up. So I was wondering if like (pause) there was some sense of me while you were there, as somebody like you could ask questions like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">that to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">You know, I mean I guess where I\u2019m going with all of this is to say that I think (pause) I mean some of last year was sometimes you coming up, I can identify in a different way that like you allow yourself in a different way to want help or ask for help. Or get certain kinds of help, (pause) in going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">to the hospital; I think in being in the hospital maybe. Like maybe it\u2019s a little easier; like some kind of a guard or a sense of independence \u2013 I mean it I think usually weighs pretty heavily that you like relax when you\u2019re there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah; yeah. (pause) It would be nice if I could find a less extreme inexpensive way of asking for this kind of help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Ah-huh.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: So \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: [Completely more of that questions I kind of never thought you\u2019d ask] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Okay. Well the thing that it makes me think of is, or of what you just said made me think of this, that both Mark and Camilla, two of the priests from Calvary visited. You know, and they were very surprised that I was doing that like that. They both sort of asked me like, \u201cYou know, what can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">we do?\u201d And I just said like, \u201cJust know that I\u2019m really not okay. (pause) I need to tell you up front that I\u2019m really not okay, because I can\u2019t act like I\u2019m not okay. I don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d But a lot of times it\u2019s [just what I do] (ph). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">You know, and it remains to be seen whether that is something that they will be able to hear, and like take away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah my thought when you said you know, I wish I could find a less extreme, less expensive way, (pause) it made me think, \u201cWell, you know there\u2019re ways in which (inaudible at 00:18:30) is pretty extremely expensive for you too, which just makes me think that you don\u2019t know (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">what they\u2019ll come with, or how much they\u2019ll be there, or how well they\u2019ll kind of keep you in mind that way. [Were you sad about that] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(pause) And the other too in which that you had, and you know, I see what it looks like when it\u2019s hanging over you in times where you go, and some of the things that are (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">relatedly causing you trouble and difficulty. You know whereas, maybe when you get there like you\u2019re asking for help; you\u2019re not wanting to talk about it, or maybe deal with some of that stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">I mean maybe that\u2019s not true, but that\u2019s what I gather you mean when you say they seem to think you\u2019re avoiding stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. (pause) It\u2019s not that clear to me in part, because like I\u2019m pretty sure Dr. (Bell) was just sort of trying to like push my buttons, and so she was being \u2013 asking a lot of provocative things, and I felt like she would like demand an explanation, and then I would try to give <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">her an explanation. Then she would be like, \u201cYou\u2019re over intellectualizing.\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cI have no idea how to deal with it. Like I don\u2019t \u2013 this is how I work; like this is what I do.\u201d (chuckle) And so yeah, that was frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">I do feel like (pause) like I cried more in the last week than I had like in the last several months. It\u2019s gotten really difficult for me to cry, and that also seems to be really important somehow. But like, (pause) you know, even in here like where I sort of \u2013 basically I feel like a lot of days <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">I come and I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m really bad, but I can\u2019t figure out where or why, and I need you to help me like pull that out.\u201d Even when I don\u2019t, (pause) I don\u2019t cry; it\u2019s like I don\u2019t (pause) I sort of feel like I\u2019ve been just sort of keeping it at arm\u2019s length.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I mean, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re frank with me about it, but you cry in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: A little bit. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: I mean man, I don\u2019t like how (inaudible at 00:22:17) you had in mind, but there are times where you\u2019ll like sob pretty hard, or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I just feel like (overlapping voices) I want to cry a lot more than I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah that you see it like \u2013 yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: No, I think I clarified that somewhat that sort of \u2013 maybe you want like \u2013 so that that doesn\u2019t happen, but it doesn\u2019t happen nearly as much as you, in a way like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: want it to or \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s also like \u2013 (pause) like I\u2019m really glad that we can meet on Tuesdays unless it\u2019s before work, but it\u2019s sort of hard to like be like, \u201cOkay, now I have to be back together.\u201d And then go on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: It seems funny like (pause) (sigh) it was a strange \u2013 it\u2019s strange to sort of be like \u2013 hang out with the other patients, and sort of be comparing my health both to them and to like my memories of where I was like a year ago of what I was dealing with. It\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, I feel like I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">come a long way (pause) in some good ways, and I feel good about that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Good. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: But also like but I\u2019m still (chuckle) in the hospital. (pause) I brought T.S. Eliot\u2019s Four Quartets, [and I\u2019m] (ph) a dick, so I think I was the most pompous patient initially.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: The Four Quartets are pretty good (pause) in terms of like, (pause) I don\u2019t know, talking about pain. (pause) So like (pause) there\u2019s one expressive therapist in particular who really goes in for like cheesy aphorisms and uplifting things. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re shocked to hear that. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">So she had like a little book, and like little different like hopeful things that we have. And all I could think of was a line from the Four Quartets which is, \u201cPeople change and smile, but the agony abides.\u201d (laughter) I\u2019m like, \u201cWell that conquers me.\u201d  (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">I was very worried that they were going to sort of push medication or ECT, and they did not, so that was good. So I sort of made it clear to them at the beginning that I didn\u2019t want them to push that and that I was worried that they would. So they just backed off, which was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) You look surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t push medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, we just didn\u2019t talk about it. Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good. I\u2019m not anti-medication, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: No, me neither. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:27:30).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But it\u2019s interesting, like (sigh) it was very unsettling to sort of be so close up against pieces that are missing (pause) like from my memory. So like to be on the same (yehh) (ph) and like \u2013 we like to take walks around the grounds, and I\u2019d be like, \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of this.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">And then I\u2019d sort of see one sort of view that looked familiar, but (sigh) (pause) like I did a partial program there, right? Like I spent a lot of time there. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">I think I did the like mood and anxiety partial program. (pause) Actually, I\u2019m sure I did, because I remember like you walk by, and I saw the inside of it, and I was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been in that room; it gets really crowded.\u201d It\u2019s like, you know, the buildings aren\u2019t really designed for what they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">doing now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: But (pause) so it\u2019s just \u2013 yeah, weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Right. Right because in your regular life, like I would imagine you don\u2019t sort of run into holes like that. I mean they\u2019ve been filled in, not necessarily that you remember, but you know, you can ask James or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, or I can say like, \u201cThis is a piece; I know this happened, but I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah; it\u2019s not quite as close.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: People remembered me, which I was not expecting; like the staff. And I remembered faces, but like not names or any reactions. But it was also weird, because I would like have a very strong like emotional feeling though. I would be like, \u201cOh, this is the relationship that I think we have, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">I have no idea what that\u2019s based on.\u201d (chuckle) So that works like both ways, you know, some people are like \u201cOh I really like you.\u201d And then a couple of people was like \u201cI really don\u2019t like you.\u201d But I don\u2019t know why. (laughter) I usually became a player.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: But I was surprised that people remembered me, which was good.

(pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, good. (pause) Yeah, it sounds like, I mean so far, it was \u2013 even though it was different, I know I was talking about that a few minutes ago; like black different; a black sort of discontinuance with (pause) what came before, than I think last year. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t quite follow what you\u2019re saying; I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s okay; I\u2019m trying to right here. Like (pause) what I have in mind is I mean like that (pause) you were kind of (pause) more ready last year to like just be taken care of, and just have a break, and a little bit more sort of (inaudible at 00:32:29), quite frankly like regressed in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">You know like (pause) or this time it seems like you (pause) were different in some ways where (pause) I don\u2019t know, a little more yourself like you had been before you went in. I mean it \u2013 you felt better, and easier to rely on people, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like you felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">like (pause) a different person. I mean this is probably stretching it for last year, but I think it was little more like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Okay. I don\u2019t remember what I was like last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: I believe that I didn\u2019t feel like a different person. I mean I, you know, it was hard to sort of be taken care of there; like it was hard to sort of relax into that. (sigh) You know I talked to people, and like I\u2019m good at talking to people, then they sort of want me to like take care of them <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">and comfort them. Then I get like super overwhelmed, because I\u2019m like \u201cI\u2019m also a patient.\u201d (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: I\u2019d like \u2013 I was mistaken for staff like many times, or multiple times, which is not actually helpful for me. And like that is not a compliment right now. (chuckle) So I was getting very sort of anxious about that, and it\u2019s like, I\u2019d be like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done with people.\u201d And go spend time in my room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I guess I\u2019m also thinking about the word question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Did you have any thoughts?

And so there\u2019s, you know, this huge circle of fans. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh that cute baby.\u201d But like I really just miss Sharon.

Part of me also doesn\u2019t, but I think that\u2019s more just being scared, and being scared about anything in particular. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Also, I guess if this was (pause) things you\u2019ve said about work before, like (pause) it hasn\u2019t seemed to me that really bad things happen at work. I mean it can be tiring; you can feel kind of squeezed; there\u2019s not a whole lot of room for your emotional life, running around <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F1\">with the kids. You said Kim can be a little intrusive, (pause) so it\u2019s like some stresses and pressure, and I could have imagined, you know, some other version of you being sad at a hospital and feeling like just a little fragile for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">But that\u2019s not the sense I\u2019m getting as you\u2019re talking; I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not fragile in some ways, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: No, that makes sense. I think what I need to do is go to work, but set it up such that on like over the weekend, that I don\u2019t have a lot of responsibility. Because I guess what I\u2019m worried about is that is sort of stress, and like working all the time will put me in the situation where I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201531\">a break and can\u2019t take one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yep.
