My string of happy Tuesdays is over. The Bruins\u2019 streak is over and my streak is over. Twelve in a row, by the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You mean, your Tuesdays or the Bruins?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: The Bruins. They lost in a shootout to Montreal. So I guess I kind of finally hit my wit\u2019s end with Marcia and the way she reacts to things that are \u2013 So, we listed the house \u2013 not the house, the condo this weekend. The first day that it was on MLS my Realtor got thirty e-mails and fifteen voice <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">mails. [1:00] So she decided on Sunday to just basically plot out an hour for people to \u2013 not advertise an open house, but you know, I think she said something like forty people came through in the hour. Multiple offers, the best offer being a cash deal for $275. Now, we were under agreement with this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">guy, Tom, whose sister and brother-in-law own unit one. And he\u2019s a big mucka muck lawyer. So they never wanted to in a purchase and sale. They basically had an offer that the buyer was free to cancel if we didn\u2019t get short sale approval within sixty days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m a little confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Two years ago we listed it with Claire. And we were under agreement basically, and I basically hand fed her some guy, with the idea that her and Jess \u2013 and they fucked it up. [2:06] But, you know, this guy\u2019s sister says to Patricia, well, the house is already under agreement. Like, we\u2019ve been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">under agreement for a year-and-a-half. I got an e-mail from this guy in November saying, are you still selling the condo. I imagine it\u2019s not a short sale anymore. Does that sound like someone who\u2019s under agreement? And most importantly, considering we got a cash offer for $275, and his offer is $259, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">is Chase going to approve a short sale of $259. And there\u2019s also language that says I there, in terms and conditions, you know, agreeable to seller. And $259 right now is not agreeable to me. [3:01] It doesn\u2019t matter to me, because the ultimate price \u2013 I\u2019m not walking away with anything, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And Jess was being a pain in the ass. She\u2019s hounding Patricia, you know. I kind of called her on it. Why are you questioning everything? She says, I\u2019m not questioning, I\u2019m just asking questions. I want to know you know. And then Patricia sort of replied to an e-mail that Jess had sent her, but cc\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">me on it. So I saw the e-mail that Jess sent. And it\u2019s like, you know, Patricia wasn\u2019t \u2013 I mean, she literally ripped Patricia for listing the place, you know. And she\u2019s like oh, you know, I thought we had to get approval from Chase, whatever. But we\u2019re working with a short sale specialist. I gave her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">the woman\u2019s number last week. She never called her. So it all becomes a panic Saturday morning. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: A short sale specialist is like a lawyer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: No. They basically are just \u2013 they work with the lender for a fee. Part of the broker\u2019s commission to get the short sale through. [4:04] And brokers are glad to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I see. Because they can be more sure it\u2019s going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: And, the funny thing is, is this guy Jerry \u2013 I handed to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: The buyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. I handed him to Claire.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: All they had to do is not fuck it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: So, Claire didn\u2019t procure him, so I could hand him off to Patricia, which I\u2019ve done. And I\u2019d prefer to accept something from Tom, because Patricia would get the entire commission, because there\u2019s no other broker involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Meaning, the short sale specialist, or meaning -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Patricia would get, you know, usually -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Patricia would be the whole commission through Jerry, if Jerry was the buyer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Well, in other words, she wouldn\u2019t have to share the commission with another realtor. [4:58] So she\u2019s going to make more money with Jerry, or someone who doesn\u2019t come through the Realtor. I think the cash offer \u2013 I don\u2019t know if the cash offer has a Realtor or whatever. But Jess\u2019 being a pain <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">in the ass. And then I\u2019m like, you know, I feel like \u2013 I felt just some \u2013 and, you know, and I\u2019ve got to get Jerry. I e-mailed Jerry and said, you know, talk to Patricia. And I gave his information to Patricia. And, you know, I feel like I at least owe Patricia an e-mail that she shouldn\u2019t find out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">that I\u2019ve gone with someone else \u2013 from someone else, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">So you know, I short her an e-mail. I said, you know, this is strictly business, you know. I\u2019m trying to build a relationship. You know, I said, you\u2019re a great person, great Realtor. We had a lot of fun. I miss those days, whatever. Bye-bye. Best of luck. [5:55] And she replies, I completely understand. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">Oh, by the way, I\u2019m holding $1,000 from Jerry, the original buyer, because he would not \u2013 Jess and I signed a release, but he wouldn\u2019t sign the release. So now -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Sorry. What would the release mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: The release is, Claire\u2019s company is holding $1,000. All the parties need to sign, giving Susan\u2019s part of the escrow agent. Whatever. And he wouldn\u2019t sign one. So, you know, so I\u2019m dealing with this. And I\u2019ve got to get a closing package done. And I\u2019m texting back and forth with Jess, and I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">just like, forget about it. It doesn\u2019t fucking matter. Just forget about it. If you\u2019re going to be a pain in the ass, forget about it. You know. Sixteen years of criminal defense has taught you everything you need to know about the real estate market, including short sales. [7:00] And my practice takes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">me nowhere near that realm, so what do I know, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">And Patricia, she\u2019s \u2013 this is her first deal, I think as a short sale specialist. So I\u2019m dealing with all that. And I accidentally told Marcia I was going to come down \u2013 I meant that I was leaving at 3:00, but I saw how it could be interpreted that I could be there around 3:00. And 3:00 was the cut-off, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">\u2018cause that\u2019s when I had to be downstairs to drop off my thing at FedEx. And so I\u2019m over at Staples making the copies, \u2018cause I save like, a penny with my Staples rewards on each copy, right? Thirty cents. And for some reason, and maybe \u2018cause it was like the dual color\/black and white copier. But the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">things like, two copies taking forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">And, you know, I know she\u2019s getting anxious and whatever. And finally I drop everything off. I\u2019m driving down and I decided to go back and take a shower. [8:12] \u2018Cause I figured I\u2019d just run over there, boom, boom, get it done, you know. And the funny thing is, is the only reason I was making a big <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">deal to get this out was because I wanted the broker to get his check, you know, the mortgage broker. So I get a call from her and I know she\u2019s agitated. And she calls up and she\u2019s just, you know, going on about how she\u2019s at her sister\u2019s and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. She could have \u2013 she was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">to go and have a drink with so-and-so, but, you know, and now, you know, but, you know. Aggravated and aggravated at me, you know. Whatever. I blew it off. And I went to pick her up at her sister\u2019s. No big deal. Whatever, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">I don\u2019t know what we did on Saturday. But on Sunday, we went to a banquet. Still, everything\u2019s going fine. But she\u2019s kind of \u2013 That morning she said \u2013 I don\u2019t know how it came up, but she said that, you know how she\u2019s always cleaning up after me and I\u2019m whatever. [9:27] You know, I don\u2019t do anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">You know. I got upset. This is exactly what fucking Jess would say to me. And the reality is, is I\u2019m going out of my way to do stuff now. I mean, I take out the trash. At Kiley\u2019s (ph) party I\u2019m cleaning up. I\u2019m doing dishes. And she was just sort of fucking with me. But I\u2019m like, you know, is she fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">with me or is there truth to this. So I got a little upset. And it just seemed like maybe I was more at that point became more sensitive to it. But you know, all day long, she was just digging into me on everything. Everything. Even when I went to tell her about the reason I was late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">I\u2019m like, you know the copy machine was going zh zh, zh zh. And then she just jumps right in and starts making for of me going zh zh, zh zh. And, you know, whatever. Okay, I won\u2019t tell you why I was late or whatever. [10:18] And I was kind of a little pissy because I had called and left her a message <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">that I was all stressed out, because of this whole thing. And so we\u2019re pulling up to her house, coming back from the banquet, and I\u2019m like, oh, you know, we got a bunch of offers on the condo. And she starts talking about my credit, and stuff like this. Then suddenly it comes up, she\u2019s like, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">these things always kind of come when she\u2019s kind of turned the other way under her breath. She\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know how two professionals can have bad credit like that. Like, excuse me? She was like, oh, forget it. And I get her to say it again, and I\u2019m like, you know, I\u2019m like, you know, hey. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F3\">running a business yourself. I had a house, a condo and kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">You can barely pay your rent, and you\u2019re telling me, you know. And she gets out of the car. I\u2019ve fought my whole life for my great credit. [11:23] Blah, blah, you know. I\u2019m just like, are you fucking kidding me? And this is what happens with everything. You know, it\u2019s the, well, why were you feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">sad? Well, the kids were just kids. Work was rough. That\u2019s life. Just another one of these complete dismissals instead of being supportive. And it\u2019s not just it\u2019s not just a dismissal, but it\u2019s actually, you know, she always turns it around where she generalizes the group of \u2013 class of people I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">in, this being people with poor credit who are professionals. And she thinks horribly of all those people, except for me, of course, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">And that\u2019s how it comes across. Sometimes it\u2019s outright blatant. She\u2019ll say, you know, the people that do that \u2013 not you, but, you know. And it\u2019s just \u2013 And so, you know, I was upset. [12:27] She could tell I was upset, but she keeps on poking me, trying to \u2013 Number one, she\u2019s continuing with the digging. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">And she had even earlier had made, before the banquet, had brought up the cleaning thing again, even though it made me upset earlier. And, you know, she\u2019s just like, mockingly trying to cheer me up almost. And we were watching some movie that sucked, and she kind of fell asleep. And, I don\u2019t know. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">ended up going to lie in the bed at like, 9:30. And I\u2019m like, sitting on the side of the bed doing things or whatever. The TV\u2019s on and I finally go, and I roll, and I lie down in bed, and she goes, goodnight and rolls over. And I\u2019m like, goodnight. And that was it. [13:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">I woke up in the morning and was just like, you know, fuck this. I can\u2019t take this. And it\u2019s 5:00 in the morning. I get up and get all my shit together and I go say goodbye to her and she just kind of mumbles how my hand is warm, and doesn\u2019t even really wake up. And I get to the office at like, 7:00, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">even before 7:00. I can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m livid. I\u2019m just, you know. So I sent her a message, basically, you know, telling her how I\u2019m really bummed that she \u2013 whatever. And the response that I get back is that I\u2019m too sensitive. She doesn\u2019t know what to say to me, because I get hurt too easily. How is she supposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">to know about what happened in my marriage? [14:14] You know, it\u2019s all defensive stuff. And basically, saying it\u2019s all my fault. You\u2019re too sensitive. I never know what to say to you. I can\u2019t say anything to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">I mean, and I\u2019m like, and I\u2019m not too sensitive, you know. These are sensitive areas. If I was to talk about your dead sister, you know, if I was to talk about your hair problems, you know. I mean, you\u2019d be sensitive to these areas, too. Come on, you know. Your sister deserved to die. She had cancer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">She was out in the sun all the time, you know. That\u2019s the kind of stuff she says to me. Obviously, it\u2019s more egregious with a dead sister and cancer -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s the point you\u2019re making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: You know, this stuff is all my fault. [15:00] And I\u2019m telling her, I just need support. I need whatever. And she doesn\u2019t even respond. I\u2019m like, hello, you know. And she\u2019s like, I have nothing to say. And I\u2019m like, call me. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t want to talk right now. I was like, I\u2019ve got the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">kids at 2:00. You know, call me before 2:00. I\u2019m just feeling \u2013 My stomach is like, I can\u2019t focus. I can\u2019t get anything done. And so she calls me, and she did say, let\u2019s pick a time when we\u2019re sober and can talk about it. And I was like, that\u2019s the problem. I can\u2019t talk about these things with you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">And she was like, well what did I do to you yesterday. And of course, it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s like at that moment, I could not think of anything she had said to me that was a dig on me. I was like, my music, my clothes. You know, generally, I don\u2019t exactly know what you were saying. But everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B3\">was some sort of dig on me. [16:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">Of course, I remember this later. Even my laptop. It\u2019s like, oh, my God. You\u2019ve gone this long without taking off your laptop. And I didn\u2019t react to any of that stuff. If I was too sensitive, I would have reacted to all that. But I think because I bring this up in the context of, this is how you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">treating me, I\u2019m all of a sudden sensitive about it. But I\u2019m saying, if this is a cumulative effect thing. And she doesn\u2019t understand that. And, you know, she continues on with, you know, attacking me. And then finally, I\u2019m like (pause). Someone just called my phone. I\u2019m like, you don\u2019t listen to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">[17:02] I can\u2019t talk to you, because you don\u2019t listen to me. You know, you change the subject. You butt in. You mock me. Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">And I gave examples of times I tried to talk to her about it, and she\u2019s changed the subject. And the response was, sorry you believe I don\u2019t listen to me, but you\u2019re way too sensitive. Same thing. And she keeps putting like, she\u2019s capitalizing words and exclamation points. You know, this woman has shown <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">no compassion. She has said nothing positive or nice to me all day. This is still like, 11:00, but all I\u2019ve gotten are, you know, whatever. I don\u2019t know how I said it. I said, is that supposed to be an apology or whatever. And she\u2019s like, I\u2019m aggravated. [18:03] You know, well, why are you lashing out. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">And she\u2019s, I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s lashing out. Okay. And later in the day she sends me a text. You know, love you. So fine. I love you, too. Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">And then finally later she\u2019s let\u2019s tomorrow \u2013 Let\u2019s get together and talk about this. Fine. I haven\u2019t texted her. That was last night. Then late last night I fell asleep on the couch. She texted me, I hate days like this or something like that. I didn\u2019t text her this morning. We\u2019ll see if she contacts <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">me. I really don\u2019t even want to go down there tonight. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I don\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s like \u2013 I\u2019ve got to see some sort of change in attitude from yesterday, because it\u2019s ridiculous. It was, you know, a complete just, fuck you, to everything I said. [19:13] And her response of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">like, when I said, you know, and you\u2019ll say things to me like, you\u2019re depressed. Get over it. Or you\u2019re fucking depressed. Get over it. And her response is, you know, I say things. I can\u2019t help it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">So she\u2019s taking no responsibility for anything she said, anything she\u2019s done. This is all \u2013 she don\u2019t know how to deal with me. And, you know, there\u2019s truth to it. And it\u2019s valid, but she\u2019s not reading anything I say, other than things that are picking out things that she\u2019s done wrong, or maybe putting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">some kind of blame on her. I know this is frustrating for you, putting in things like that. And I don\u2019t know what to say. At some point there would be this realization or this understanding, or at least when I told her, this is how you need to react. And she was asleep, and I just can\u2019t talk to her <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200532\">about these kinds of things. [20:34] And being in a message and impersonal. I brought out all kinds of stuff where there was like, no response to whatever. But she sends me a picture of her dog. I just want to say, go fuck yourself. She goes, sorry, but you think I don\u2019t listen. I guess sometimes I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200533\">do have a problem with that, but you, capital A-R-E very sensitive. I can\u2019t say anything without you getting upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">And I go, is that supposed to be some sort of apology, you know. But the other stuff is in Messenger, because I was on my computer. [21:36] (pause) You know, I was just telling her how it\u2019s complicated. For some reason, everybody thinks that their life is worse than mine, like, they\u2019ve gone through <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">struggles and I haven\u2019t done anything, you know. So talking about that, and the last five years have been difficult. And I said, I know you don\u2019t intend it, but you can be judgmental and condescending when it comes to my mental health, medicine, kids, and financial issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">This upsets me. I need you to be supportive. I don\u2019t need you to try to fix it, or cheer me up, or apologize over and over. [22:28] Just a hey, that sucks would be better. Don\u2019t take it personally. I know it\u2019s hard to live with someone who is depressed and I appreciate that you put up with whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">I also felt you were busting on my constantly, all day long. Cleaning and clothes was a big issue in my marital problems. You don\u2019t know this, but it still upsets me. So I said, and you don\u2019t know this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: Right. You\u2019re pretty open, actually. You don\u2019t sound defensive at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: I said, for many reasons, I have trouble having serious conversations with you about me. So I wrote some of it down. I thought I needed to express these things. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so impersonal. I love you very much. Her response. Ugh. Well, sometimes I feel like I have to be so careful with what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B1\">I say, because you\u2019re so sensitive. I can\u2019t help what comes out of my mouth sometimes. It just does. I don\u2019t mean to hurt you, but you\u2019re easily hurt. I\u2019m not used to that, or used to someone constantly depressed. That is very difficult for me. [23:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">She keeps going on how she was there for her nephew and took care of him and to check in and bailed him out of prison, but she\u2019s never been around someone who\u2019s \u2013 that is very difficult for me. Fine. You know it is. What was the big deal about cleaning? That upsets you that much, that much being all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">caps and a question mark, exclamation mark, question mark. So when you say it\u2019s hard to talk to me, I also think it\u2019s hard to talk to you, never knowing what\u2019s quote, unquote okay to talk about, dot, dot, dot. So I replied. This is long, if we\u2019ve got time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not constantly depressed, I\u2019m not easily hurt, and I\u2019m not so sensitive. I take constant abuse for a living. Please understand these are major issues in my life. I have overcome a lot, am the happiest I have been in a long time. Frequently, I don\u2019t think you realize the things you say to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">me. Example, you\u2019re depressed. Get over it. I didn\u2019t talk to you after that, and for some reason, that made me the asshole. One reason we have problems talking is because you will not listen to me. The first time you asked me about why I went into therapy, I said two or three sentences, and you took <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200612\">over the conversation and completely changed the subject. Most of the time when you ask me a question, you cut me off and start talking about you or something else. A few weeks ago you asked me about why I was sad. It was many things, but I started with the kids. You muttered under your breath, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200613\">are kids. I go on to say that work was difficult and you mutter under your breath, that\u2019s life. Why should I continue? Why should that not upset me? How would a conversation with you go, if I had talked about how I used to have suicidal ideations, which, she probably has no idea what that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Oh, I bet she does. [25:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: Should I just go put on my big girl pants? That\u2019s what she always says to me. Right or wrong, I\u2019ve always had this feeling that I do not get the credit for things I do. Instead, I\u2019ve always been called an underachiever. With Jess it was always a big issue that I did not pull my weight around <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">the house. I pulled my weight and then some, but it wasn\u2019t the chores Jess thought I should be doing or even knew I was doing. I guess she thought after a fifteen hour day at work, I was supposed to come home and mot the floor. This was very contentious. Had arguments in marriage counseling. You hit <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">a sore spot by saying I don\u2019t clean up and what not. When you were busting on me over and over again about this and my clothes and my music and pretty much anything I did yesterday, it added up.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">The financial thing was just too much. That\u2019s not being oversensitive. I said, you can talk to me about anything. You can ask me any questions. You just have to listen and be supported. Once again, I know your frustrations. That is why I\u2019m trying to tell you these things. [26:09] And that was 8:37 in <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">the morning. So at 10:20 I\u2019m like, no response? Nothing? I mean, look how long that \u2013 you know? And I thought I said some pretty personal things and that I would get some reaction to. And she says, whatever I say won\u2019t come out right, so I don\u2019t really want to try to write my feelings. Then I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200672\">then call me. Don\u2019t feel like talking right now. I said, great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">I\u2019m swinging in the breeze here. Let me know when you want to talk. I pick up the kids at 2:00 and would like to talk before then. She says, you told me how you felt. I told you how I felt. What else is there to say? And my response is, you can\u2019t be fucking serious. And then she called me. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">there\u2019s the \u2013 And I told her basically the same thing. You don\u2019t listen to me, you know. I couldn\u2019t give a specific example of a \u2013 I\u2019m reliving my marriage with this woman. And now she texts me a picture of her dog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I get what you\u2019re saying about reliving your marriage in that \u2013 [27:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: That just adds to it. That\u2019s not the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I was also going to say that your reacting pretty differently than you did in your marriage. I mean, sure you said a few things that were defensive or depressive. But a lot of things you said, were not. You know what I mean? Like, it seems to me that you were much more open with her about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">like, hey look, this is what I want. This is why I hurt. This is you\u2019re doing that bothers me. I wish you\u2019d do it this other way. Which I think actually is pretty different from how you often were in the marriage. Like, with Jess, I think you felt much more defensive and much more dominated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: I think I just assume that either all women, or at least women I\u2019m attracted to \u2013 And that\u2019s the thing with Marcia. It\u2019s like, you know, okay, so we break up and then I go on to the next woman, and it\u2019s like, it\u2019s going to be the same thing. [28:29] You know, it\u2019s like, this is not \u2013 A lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200711\">this is no person specific. You know, I feel like it\u2019s \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s on me to get this stuff across. And that, to a larger part I\u2019m incapable of doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re pretty clear on a lot of that. I mean, I understand that there was a moment when you were on the phone when you couldn\u2019t think of things that she had done earlier in the \u2013 the previous day, I guess, that had really bothered you. But you were not at a loss for what you thought or felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200731\">through most of the interaction, at least as I\u2019m hearing it. Look, I\u2019m not trying to say it wasn\u2019t kind of, an excruciating day, the back and forth with her. I know it was. But I am saying, you know, you were not at a loss for words, or unclear in your thinking, it seems to me, through a lot of it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200732\">Nor were you simply reacting. You know, it seems you put some thought into what you wrote and that you had pretty good access to what had happened and where you were coming from a lot of the time. [29:36] For example like, you know the stuff you just read to me. My sense is that it still sounds pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200733\">right on to you. In other words, that you didn\u2019t say, oh, my Gosh, I was in such a state when I wrote this. It sounds pretty clear-headed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">CLIENT: I went out of my way to accept blame where I should accept blame, but still \u2013 and point out I understand that, you know, this is difficult on you and I understand that. I\u2019m not \u2013 it\u2019s the I\u2019m so sensitive. I\u2019m easily hurt. You know, you can\u2019t talk to me. And this is the perfect example where <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200751\">it may be reading, but it\u2019s not listening. If she read that and heard what I said, her response would have been different. And by the time she responded, she probably felt poked, and that\u2019s why I got these negative responses. But I still feel like I\u2019m owed something here. [30:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: I would imagine that you want her to show that she actually took in what you said, which is the thing she hasn\u2019t been doing, or at least it feels like she hasn\u2019t been doing through the whole thing. Yes, I get that it bothers you when I do this. Yes, I understand that even though I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200771\">know it was a sort spot, I know it is a sore spot and I will not do that. Or, I get that the financial stuff is stressful and you have a lot more expenses than I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: Kids. Things come out of my mouth, and I can\u2019t help it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Right. I understand. Sort of a disavowed responsibility through all this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, you\u2019re fucking 44 years-old, you know? And of course yesterday when all of this is going on, normally they have a buyer when they purchase a house, make the bank check that they need to bring to closing payable to themselves. And I always did this kind of \u2013 that\u2019s what all other lawyers <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D1\">did and that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. And for me, it was just a way for me to show that that was the buyer\u2019s money. That if there was ever this implication that I was in on some conspiracy for them to get a loan from somewhere else, I\u2019d say look, you know, this is a bank check made out to the buyer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D2\">It\u2019s their money. Even if it\u2019s, you know, who is this purchased by or remitted \u2013 that doesn\u2019t matter. And I have them sign it at closing. And this of course, was my first purchase, \u2018cause I had deposited \u2013 and in a re-fi I don\u2019t have them do that. I just have them make the check out to my office. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D3\">know, and I deposited the $3,000 check. So I go to TD to deposit this $3,000 check and they\u2019re like, we need her to come into the bank and sign an affidavit. What? We need her to come. How do we know that\u2019s her signature. I said because, you\u2019ve got defenses and protections and there\u2019s this thing called <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D4\">Uniform Commercial Code. And it\u2019s my client trust account. I have responsibility for. I\u2019m telling you, I saw her sign that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F\">She\u2019s like well, okay. I go well, let me speak to the manager, which was a mistake. \u2018Cause this is presumably someone who\u2019s ultimately supposed to meet and do business with. And she tells me the same thing, you know, regulations, because people are acting on it now. These aren\u2019t regulations. These are <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F1\">banks just realizing how much control they have and doing things the way they want to do, because they know we have no choice. Actually, I do have a choice. And I said, you have other conveyancing attorneys. I said, do you have other attorneys who have accounts with you? And she\u2019s like, yeah, we have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F2\">a lot of attorneys. I should have been like, do you have any real estate attorneys, you know. \u2018Cause they\u2019re always like, have it made out to you. So I said well, you just lost a customer who would be sending millions of dollars through your bank, and I walked out the door. Which I shouldn\u2019t have said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F3\">but I was having a crappy day. Actually, it may be a good thing, because now I can go back and apologize to her. [34:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20081\">But \u2013 and I know I can deposit it into my People\u2019s account, but that\u2019s how I always did it. Of course, I wrote my TD account on there, so I\u2019ve got to wipe that out. It\u2019s just a fucking pain in the ass. So that is one more thing. Is this going to cause the account to bounce, you know? Oh, and I\u2019ve got <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200811\">this hearing tomorrow. It\u2019s a conservatorship, which I\u2019ve never done before. And this guy I\u2019m dealing with is a little overbearing. Even the GAL made a comment about it. You know, he\u2019s a good guy, you know. He knows his stuff, but he\u2019s a little over the top. And one of the things he\u2019s \u2013 he keeps bringing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200812\">up fraud. How he\u2019s got this case where the hospital is coming after his client for fraud. [35:29] He\u2019s worried about my client, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20083\">And basically, he\u2019s trying \u2013 intentionally or unintentionally, he\u2019s trying to push me towards a settlement, and you can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t threaten \u2013 I mean, he wasn\u2019t threatening to turn him in, but, you know. So finally \u2013 he\u2019s asking me for my guy to sign off with getting another medical cert, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200831\">you don\u2019t need. We just have a status hearing coming up. Like, why do you need the medical certificate? He\u2019s like, we have a hearing. We have a, you know, the judge is going to want to see it. According to the rules, according to the statues, I\u2019ve read these things 20 times. When you file the petition, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200832\">you need the certificate and when you have a motion hearing, you need a certificate. And we have neither. And he keeps telling me, you know, well conservators get appointed and then the toothpaste is going to be out of the tube. [36:21] He\u2019s basically offering me exactly what a conservator \u2013 he wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200833\">a conservator to do, thinking that somehow the hospital thing is going to go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20085\">It\u2019s kind of complicated to get into it. But, you know, I said, why should my guy sign that, you know? If the conservator\u2019s best interest is, you know, this woman, why would he turn her into the hospital, you know? I would turn my clients in for committing fraud or serious bodily injury. Those are the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200851\">only things I\u2019m required to turn my clients in for. If they are at the high \u2013 I think they\u2019re going to commit serious bodily injury, I have to turn them in. If they had come in and said, you know what, I did threaten the president of the United States. I did sell secrets to China.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20087\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s like me. [37:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20089\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m like, why do you want this certificate? I said, you know. And he thinks this is going to be substantive hearing. I\u2019m like, this is a continuation of a status conference. Do you got the citation, which he did. The return date was the 19th, and as it says right on the citation, I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200891\">30 days to file an affidavit in opposition. Why are we having a substantive hearing before those 30 days are up? And then, he\u2019s like, well, she\u2019s got you know. He\u2019s always putting me down like I don\u2019t know anything. I don\u2019t know if he knows this is my first conservator or whatever. I am inexperienced <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200892\">in those areas. That\u2019s fine. But he brings this up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008B\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s sort of like, he\u2019s also wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008D\">CLIENT: He\u2019s like, you know, the judge is going to appoint a temporary conservator on Wednesday. That\u2019s fine, because the statute says a judge can only appoint a temporary conservator in an emergency. [38:33] Like, if something was going to happen to the property and it has to be on motion. Where\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2008D1\">the motion? You know, so I don\u2019 think this guy is actually doing this intentionally. I just think in his mind, he\u2019s got the cart before the horse so badly. You know. This is the guy who puts on there, L.I.C.S.W., you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Really? Like he himself is an L.I.C.S.W.?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s his bona fides along with, you know, esquire. So I can\u2019t really figure this out, you know. And it\u2019s a case I really need to shit or get off the pot on. And I\u2019ve been meaning to do stuff for this hearing to at least, you know, have gotten up to speed. Everybody\u2019s going to walk in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200911\">there and it\u2019s like judge, you know, I\u2019ve got 30 days from the return date, you know, if you want to schedule a future status conference or some deadlines, that\u2019s fine. [39:40] But I have \u2018til whatever date to file my opposition. There\u2019s no motion before the court, you know. \u2018Cause he\u2019s like \u2013 he keeps <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200912\">threatening, I\u2019m going to go and tell the judge I haven\u2019t done my due diligence, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20093\">Like, judges really care about that. You know, I asked you guys to come to a settlement agreement. Have you guys worked on it? You know, I have your honor, but counsel here hasn\u2019t done anything. The judge is going to be like, whoa, Attorney Swisher. Court officer, will you take Mr. Swisher into custody <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200931\">for violating court \u2013 You know, it\u2019s like, the only thing he\u2019s offered me is what a conservator would do if he won. You haven\u2019t offered me anything, and you\u2019re being a prick, you know. Your honor, I don\u2019t know. According to him you\u2019re going to appoint a temporary conservator at this hearing, and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200932\">game\u2019s over. He\u2019s seen this so many times. It\u2019s going to run its course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20095\">Here\u2019s the e-mail, you know, which presumably he wants to show it anyways. [40:40] That has me a little anxious, just because I\u2019ve never been there before. I\u2019m not as anxious as I would usually be, you know. And, you know, the money thing still \u2013 I\u2019m starting to get the second wave of people I initially <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200951\">met with. You know, estate planning is starting to hire me. People are getting towards the end of the month where they wanted to wait to move out or whatever. You know, so some of these things are going to start coming through. And there were a couple people \u2013 I didn\u2019t intentionally do it, but last <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200952\">week I didn\u2019t get back to. Like, someone called on Monday. Well by Thursday, when I realized I hadn\u2019t called them back, it was too late. And it\u2019s like, I\u2019ve got to not worry about touching every person that calls. [41:33] You know, I\u2019ve only got so much time. And if I miss people, I miss people.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562382\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20097\">But I think because of that, things have slowed down just a little bit. I don\u2019t seem to be getting as many inquiries a day that I was, which, whatever. It may be because at the end of the month, there\u2019s more tenants getting \u2013 having issues crop up, because everything (inaudible at 41:56). And the guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200971\">who threatened to beat me up, the property manager, the mobster wanna be? The guy called me a Jew bastard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20099\">THERAPIST: No, I don\u2019t think I heard about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009B\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Long story short. This guy called me a Jew bastard, \u2018cause I was beating up on the 85-year-old woman. Well, the 85-year-old woman called me. And she\u2019s like, you know who your client is? I said, you know, your guy claims that \u2013 Well, first of all, you\u2019ve done all these things wrong, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2009B1\">and you shouldn\u2019t be having your mobster, property manager wanna be threaten to kill me and to beat me up. And I said, you know, these were just done wrong. 42:34] And I told her, I said, this is how it has to be. She\u2019s like, well, I never collected $30. I go, well your agent collected $30. They can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2009B2\">collect $30. I want it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009D\">So your guy claims my client\u2019s a drug addict. There\u2019s all these police reports. Great. You\u2019ve still got to give a proper notice to quit to terminate the tenants. So she actually, at the end of the phone call says to me, she goes, you know, you\u2019ve been very professional and nice and I appreciate your <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2009D1\">talking to me. I don\u2019t have the money, but I guess I\u2019m going to have to hire a lawyer or go at it alone. And I said, whatever you do, just let me get Enzo on the stand. I said, I love people with anger management problems. Telling her, just go ahead and make my day. I said, that would be the most fun <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2009D2\">I\u2019ve had in my life, cross-examining that guy on the stand. If you decide to go forward with this, do me that favor. All right. Wish me luck tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I hope it goes well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A1\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
