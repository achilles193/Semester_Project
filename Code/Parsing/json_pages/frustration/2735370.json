(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Never ending winter. How are things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I guess okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: You always hesitate to get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure where to start. It\u2019s a broad question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I know, in a way, it may seem like an aside that it\u2019s hard to start and then once you get into it, you get into it; but I was thinking about it last week, actually, that there may be some small layer in here starting or we need to start that has to do with whether or not you can have what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">you would want and have your experience and come in and get to be yourself and just take that space for yourself with wherever you are.  Do you know what I mean? That, I think, plays out with Ivan a little bit; like do you have the right to just have what you need and want to be really important and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">front and center all the time, instead of quietly waiting, waiting, waiting to see if he will do it and then letting it out or it explodes later. Not more but . . . I wonder what it is like for you, for example, just to come in and start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a weird analogy, but it sometimes feels like, for example \u2013 and this doesn\u2019t really happen \u2013 but if I did have a really bad day at work and my sister called and was trying to talk, I would be like, \u201cOh, my day was fine. How was yours?\u201d  Because I wouldn\u2019t want to be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">\u201cOh, I had the worst day ever and not listen about her day or take over the whole conversation and be negative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s so interesting; even with your sister.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I think especially with her. This sounds critical of my mom, but we\u2019ve both experienced what it\u2019s like to have a conversation that\u2019s really one-sided, that\u2019s really negative, and it\u2019s really hard, even when you love the person. It can be draining or it can be hard to listen to. It can feel really negative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: So for both of you listening to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. Individually. Sometimes that\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t want to give space to whatever legitimately is not going well, but sometimes it\u2019s nice to talk about what\u2019s going on with the other person; what\u2019s going on with you.  And it\u2019s nice even if things aren\u2019t going great to not have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">a really negative conversation. If it\u2019s something really serious that\u2019s one thing. So sometimes I feel a little bit guilty about that and I don\u2019t want to come off as depressed or negative or a Debbie downer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Even here. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Which is bizarre because, clearly, I\u2019m seeing you because I have depression anxiety, although sometimes I worry I also give you the wrong impression because, obviously, my focus in here is that portion and so you might not hear about all the positives unless I\u2019m really cognizant of it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">that\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019m not coming to you because of that (chuckles), if that makes any sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It does make sense. I think there are ways, then, that you and your sister \u2013 sometimes she shares this, too \u2013 but you\u2019re talking about a kind of identification with your mother, in a way, meaning that there is a fear of ever being like her in that respect.  So what may happen is that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">guard so much against that that it becomes hard to just be yourself. Your mother complained and vented and was negative so much that you never had the experience of just getting to be natural and spontaneous wherever you are. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I think I do, but I think as a child, in theory \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 but in theory, you would play a more selfish role. If you come home from school and your mom had a terrible day, you would expect, as a child, I guess, to be able to completely take up the whole space in the conversation with how <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">bad your day was and your mom be really sympathetic, as opposed to, as an adult, the two-way of \u201cyou had a rough day; my day wasn\u2019t so great either\u201d or \u201cactually, this went really well for me.\u201d And that didn\u2019t really necessarily happen.  Well, it maybe did, but in the reverse sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yes, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: And I just don\u2019t want to be like that. As bizarre as it sounds \u2013 and it\u2019s not a reflection on you, it\u2019s really me \u2013 sometimes I have thought obviously I\u2019m dealing with depression and anxiety, I feel bad that you start your Monday morning like that. And clearly you went into this profession because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">you\u2019re very good at handling it. You\u2019re capable. It\u2019s not any doubt of that, but I feel bad burdening or starting off the week, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really an identification. It\u2019s as though you\u2019re making me feel what you felt as a child. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I never thought of it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: In other words, you could be the mother coming in and venting and spewing and negative and I could be feeling like . . . Again, I know this is not a conscious thought, but the quiet fantasy is that you almost need to protect me the way you were not protected. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s hard to figure out as a normal boundary. Even with my sister sometimes, if she has a really bad day, sometimes she won\u2019t tell me at all because she\u2019s worried that I will worry about her; that I\u2019ll call her the next day and be like, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d so she won\u2019t tell me or she\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">be like, \u201cCome hang out with me\u201d and she\u2019ll de-stress that way. But she won\u2019t tell me that anything is going on. More or less lately in the past few months I\u2019ve started to do that somewhat with her, especially since telling her about what happened with Ivan, that that weighs so heavily on her and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">was so worked up and she was so worried about me. She was really intensely feeling so much pain, so sometimes I\u2019ve tried to be like, \u201cNo, nothing is going on. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She gets worried and worked up because she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re telling the truth. How do I know you won\u2019t tell me if something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">. . . But you\u2019ll tell me if something is really wrong?\u201d  So it\u2019s hard to figure out that boundary and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different with a sibling than it is even with a friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s different with a sibling, sure, and yet, you both have this history now that you share where there has been a kind of sharing from someone you love that was too much, that pulled you both into a kind of caretaking role of your mother, setting yourselves aside and taking care of her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">In other words, then there is a risk that you could do that with each other, too. Like if she tells you\u2019re having a bad day, you could set yourself really aside and be worried about her and taking care of her and ask how she\u2019s doing; and then she could do the same thing towards you because you haven\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">had the histories to be the kid who has had a really bad day. And maybe mom sometimes has had a bad day because parents are humans, right? But to have an experience where mom says, \u201cI had a really lousy day. I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m in a bad mood. It has nothing to do with you. Tell me about your day.\u201d  And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B3\">trying their best to kind of set that aside so you don\u2019t have to worry so much about mom\u2019s subjectivity. You can kind of take it for granted that you know when she has a bad day, she\u2019s still going to be mom. That didn\u2019t happen for either one of you. You had to get really worried and preoccupied with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B4\">her mind and kind of set yourselves aside. So I think there is the risk of doing that with each other and that\u2019s more of what you\u2019re trying to find a balance with her. How do we be sisters and really hear each other\u2019s intimate, personal lives and also not feel like it\u2019s our job to be overly worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B5\">and concerned? You\u2019re going to both be okay, too. You don\u2019t have to be as worried as you were as children.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really hard, especially for Emma and I, I think, because she really took the role of my mom a lot, which I think older sisters can do naturally, to some extent. But from 14 on, she really took the role really intensely.  My mom would always be like, \u201cShe has a mom, Emma. Don\u2019t.\u201d It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">very legitimate, I think, because it really wasn\u2019t coming from my mom. Not that my mom was a bad mom, but there were things that weren\u2019t happening and Emma really filled that roll. So sometimes now I feel like she goes to the extreme and she will barely say anything. She\u2019s very, very reserved because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">she worries. She takes herself out of it, puts herself aside, to make sure that I don\u2019t worry about her or follow up with her or that I don\u2019t feel like I could tell her if I had a bad day if she did, too, because I\u2019ll be so worried about her or preoccupied. We\u2019ve talked about that and she knows that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Oh, a lot. And she definitely won\u2019t, unless it\u2019s really affecting her physically, she won\u2019t tell my parents \u2013 especially my mom. She doesn\u2019t want to be judged. She doesn\u2019t want to be criticized.  And I think she feels like there is not a lot of space for it which, sadly, I think is often true. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">I know she does this, too, I\u2019ll even try to protect her in a second-hand type of way. This past week I did get upset. I was planning to talk to you about this anyway because I was on the phone with my mom. That\u2019s fine, but at one point she brought into the conversation how my dad forgot their very first <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">anniversary and every year she tells me how he forgot or there was a year when I reminded him like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s coming up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t remember, is it the second or the fourth of March? I can never remember.\u201d And she yelled at me that I mentioned it beforehand, that it was like a reminder <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200413\">to him, even though that wasn\u2019t my intent to save him. It just gets really uncomfortable. It\u2019s not my business and I could never even ask them how their anniversary was.  I could never even call them and wish them happy anniversary because that would start a huge fight. I feel uncomfortable sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200414\">if my dad does stuff for Emma and I. Like he sent us both flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day. It doesn\u2019t matter, but the company he used has a lot of missed deliveries around the weather, so I was like, \u201cDad\u2019s really bummed because they didn\u2019t get her.\u201d That was so sweet and thoughtful.\u201d She was like, \u201cMine <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200415\">didn\u2019t get here either.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d She was like, \u201cThat\u2019s because he didn\u2019t send me any. He wouldn\u2019t send me any flowers.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Of course I\u2019m sad that he didn\u2019t. It sounds like he maybe didn\u2019t get her flowers and I\u2019m sad about that, but I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200416\">want to feel guilty or like she\u2019s jealous.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s [vicious] (ph)? towards you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think she means it that way. I think she is hurt and it comes out that . . . I don\u2019t know what the goal is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Ramona, it\u2019s as though you don\u2019t exist as her daughter in that space. She\u2019s so caught up in her own mind venting, spewing, angry. She\u2019s not thinking about what this is like for you to hear or whether it will hurt you or whether it is good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think so. And since she lost her mom, which is still very much at the forefront of her mind, I think it might have been that conversation \u201cand my mom makes it this way.\u201d We were talking about a recipe and I didn\u2019t correct her, but it\u2019s just really hard for her to accept and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">been years. We all miss all of our grandparents. All of our grandparents have passed away. She would talk with her regularly and she was very important to her and I think, because there was so much role reversal with us growing up, it just never got corrected or adjusted.  It never got acknowledged <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">that we should share in ways that our parents shouldn\u2019t with us because they\u2019re our parents, not our adult equals, if that makes any sense. Even if we\u2019re all adults now, it doesn\u2019t mean that we should be privy to everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the part that also, just to say to you, has a layer of aggression that may be completely unconscious for her, but it\u2019s beyond just oversharing. In other words, she could have said to you, \u201cWow, my feelings are so hurt because dad didn\u2019t buy me flowers.\u201d But there is a way she says <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">it that\u2019s really aggressive. Do you know what I mean? The way it comes out is even beyond not holding your mind in mind. There is something really cruel about it towards him and, unconsciously, towards you and towards Emma that I think is harder to grasp, in a way.  It\u2019s as though she\u2019s quietly destroying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">your getting flowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Which is bizarre, because if there is one thing they\u2019ve always both said, like the only thing they\u2019ve always agreed on, is how much they love us and they\u2019re so grateful; but it almost is. My dad would never say anything if my mom did something like that for Emma and I and then didn\u2019t do it for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">him. He\u2019s also very different. I don\u2019t think she necessarily thinks about it or realizes it like \u201cboy, she\u2019s going to feel horrible if I say something like \u2018my flowers didn\u2019t get here either\u2019 because he would never send me any.\u201d I have seen him give her flowers over the years.

In other words, it doesn\u2019t feel like she could still be simultaneously thrilled that her husband, your dad, bought you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">flowers. Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s as though that can\u2019t be good, then, if he didn\u2019t get them for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: It\u2019s almost like a jealousy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: Which makes you feel guilty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: It feels horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You are being used as a kind of pawn in the middle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: It feels horrible, especially because Emma and I have never asked him to send us flowers or expect him to \u2013 any of it \u2013 and when he just does it it\u2019s so thoughtful, especially since he does work like crazy and that he took time to do that is just really, really sweet; and it really gets soured. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\"> It\u2019s really hard because in that situation I always think about it and replay it in my mind later. It upsets me. I do feel guilty, of course, and I do feel like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sad that they didn\u2019t end up having a good anniversary. Thirty-one years is a long time. I wish they would work on . . .\u201d I wish <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">so many things it\u2019s hard not to think about it and get preoccupied with it, especially when your dragged into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Especially when she\u2019s making you get preoccupied with it. That\u2019s the point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve tried to appropriately say, \u201cI love you both. I want the best for both of you, but I really don\u2019t want to be in the middle.\u201d And I don\u2019t think she ever realizes she\u2019s putting me there, even though it\u2019s glaringly obvious. With comments like that, I don\u2019t think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">she thinks about it that way or realizes it. It sounds bizarre, but I think there is an element of control to it because I\u2019m pretty sure if she talked to her cousins or one of my grandmother\u2019s siblings, she wouldn\u2019t talk like that.  It\u2019s not appropriate and I think she knows that on some level. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">might say like, \u201cOh, Adam forgot,\u201d but I don\u2019t think she would bash him verbally because . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: Only to you. Only to the most inappropriate person to which to bash him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: I never know what to do in that situation because I have, like I said, said \u201cplease leave me out of it\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m really sorry it happened.\u201d (sighs) And it never changes, so there is not much to do except to accept that, if I\u2019m going to call her, I have to be prepared that that can happen and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">to not react to it. So I didn\u2019t get worked up and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to call dad and be like why didn\u2019t he . . ?\u201d anymore. There was a time when I would which I think, to an extent, is what she wanted. They would use us, kind of, to get to the other. That\u2019s the most I can do. But whenever I get off the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">phone, I really am upset and it does sting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: It makes sense then, Ramona, that it\u2019s hard for you at some level deep inside you that that is not now it feels to me being with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Oh, no. This is your profession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I just think intellectually you know that, but the point is that where your heart lies, where the feelings lie, there is some anxiety about your taking up space then with your own mind, with your own anger, with your own frustration, your own sadness, your own depression. It could feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">it\u2019s hurtful to the other person, the way you were hurt over and over \u2013 and still are to this day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Not even just hurt, but that\u2019s a pretty typical conversation with my mom. She\u2019ll talk about the pets and who has a cold or who just got groomed and whatever; and I get angry because we\u2019re on the phone and we\u2019re talking about them instead of . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re more important than you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: They\u2019re more important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Why would you not get furious at that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s like . . . So that can be . . . Whatever. And then she\u2019ll go through my great aunts and uncles who are in their 80\u2019s and late 90\u2019s, very old. \u201cThey have health problems.\u201d Of course they have health problems. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not sad, but they\u2019re at that age and she\u2019ll go through <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">who is having surgery and who is in the hospital and whose spouse is worried to death. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care. I do, of course. I know what it\u2019s like to have a conversation that\u2019s one-sided and really depressing; and it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard, especially when you\u2019re calling at the end of the week and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200752\">you just want to talk about what\u2019s new or what\u2019s going on.  It\u2019s also hard because, for her, that is what\u2019s new and what\u2019s going on because she doesn\u2019t leave the house and she doesn\u2019t interact with people. It\u2019s really sad and I wish I could change it. Anyway . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you\u2019re coming to terms with the fact that this is the way she\u2019s going to be; and I know you sort of have made terms with it for a long time when you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do. There is not much else to do because I\u2019ve said this to her and it just doesn\u2019t change,\u201d that she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">is going to keep being her and doing what she does and doing the manipulations and the tricks and maneuvers. So the only thing left, if you can\u2019t get through to her, the other part of it is having you continue to protect you inside you. How are there ways that you could have a conversation that\u2019s really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200772\">really triggering this old stuff and let it go, not have to become preoccupied with it.  For example, what we\u2019re talking about with you and Emma: can you talk to each other about your days and really feel deep empathy for each other and be there for each other, as needed? But also not have it be that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200773\">Emma, for example, could get so preoccupied with worry for you because she feels responsible for you somewhat \u2013 and you towards her, too \u2013 because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re both adults now and that actually is a remnant from your history, from your childhood for both of you of being overly responsible for <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200774\">the sake of another person in a way that\\\u2019s not good for you. It\u2019s actually not good for you that she feels overly responsible for you at this point \u2013 and you for her. It\u2019s really good that your adult sisters. You really need each other in that way, but not adult parents to the other one.  [I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200775\">it\u2019s really good for you to be here and that we are able to talk about this, having you] (ph?) come in in a place where it\u2019s really important for you to be wherever you are, including depressed and anxious or down or furious \u2013 or good. It could include all the positive feelings and just being yourself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200776\">That\u2019s a kid coming home from school. It\u2019s hopefully not a bad day every day, but there are bad days. How do you get to be there? How do you get to be when something good happens? And just trust that it\u2019s really important for you to be where you are and that it\u2019s safe to do that. I think that\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200777\">\u201cyou\u201d that\u2019s still kind of unsure \u2013 is it okay or do I have to be preoccupied with where my mind is or something? Or do I not want to hear this today because I\u2019m in a bad mood? Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: For what it\u2019s worth, I have felt more able to tell Ivan how I feel in an appropriate way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Great. I\u2019ve heard it from you, Ramona. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: The only thing, I will say, is that we have these little conversations and we had one in which I wanted to talk with Ivan about how we can work on him feeling comfortable with confronting me and even himself in a really healthy, aboveboard way; that I\u2019d love to hear, in an appropriate way, if <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D1\">he\u2019s super annoyed that I \u2013 whatever \u2013 fill in the blank. And I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s something that you feel that you\u2019d like to \u2013 what\u2019s an example you can think of?\u201d And he said, \u201cSometimes your constructive criticism feels more critical than constructive,\u201d and part of me just shattered inside because I felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D2\">I have been working insanely hard to be actually very constructive, very gentle, very appropriate. Even just feeling really empowered listening, like, \u201cThank you for telling me that you lied. I also feel really disappointed, frustrated, angry\u201d and that being okay.  And also they\u2019re both true. On the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D3\">other hand, we talked about it a little bit and I said, \u201cIvan, sometimes I hear you repeating what I said or you think it\u2019s what I said and I hear you criticizing yourself and I don\u2019t know how to change that thought.\u201d We were having dinner the other night and he put a lot of pasta on his plate, some <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D4\">pasta on mine with some asparagus and I was like, \u201cIvan, you don\u2019t have to just have pasta for dinner. Have some of this asparagus. I don\u2019t want to have to have the whole tray.\u201d Part of me was thinking Ivan has gained a lot of weight back and, really, (chuckles) three cups of pasta is a really bad dinner <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D5\">for him, but I was saying it in such a way like \u201cI don\u2019t have to have all of it.\u201d Ivan was like, \u201cWell, you\u2019re telling me that I shouldn\u2019t eat all of this pasta.\u201d I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said. I think you\u2019re critical of it and you\u2019re saying that\u2019s what I\u2019m always saying or that\u2019s exactly how <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D6\">I\u2019m phrasing it.\u201d that So that\u2019s something, I guess, that we\u2019re working on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Even if you are minorly critical. For example, if it\u2019s in your mind \u2013 three cups of pasta is not a healthy dinner for anyone to have. It\u2019s not a balanced diet and being a little bit conscious of that and concerned about him, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re being hostilely critical. It can\u2019t be that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">what needs to happen is that you have no criticism of anything because that\u2019s not being a human being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: I talked with him a little bit more about it and I said, \u201cI think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve come to think of when you think of not being criticized; it\u2019s not hearing anything, whether it\u2019s appropriate or not, and that hasn\u2019t been very helpful to you. And I actually really do love you, so I do want <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">you to be healthy and I do want you to eat a balanced mean. I\u2019m sad, actually, that someone didn\u2019t say that to you sooner because I think it\u2019s a lot more loving than \u2018I don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings so, please, do whatever you want.\u2019\u201d  So I feel like we\u2019re making some progress there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s really tough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re trying to sort of say, as he says this about you, it\u2019s such a lovely moment when you\u2019re able to say, in a way, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s true that there are still remnants from my approach as kind of hostile critical instead of constructive. I\u2019ve been working really hard on it and I actually think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200871\">I\u2019ve made some significant changes, but I\u2019m open. I\u2019ll keep listening for it. At the same time, Ivan, I feel like the thing that I\u2019m hoping you keep working on is that any even constructive feedback\u201d he thinks, \u201cI think you experience as hostile criticism. So this is where we kind of meet. We\u2019re trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200872\">to find our way together. \u201c Actually, having constructive criticism is an extremely loving thing, but he is filled with so much self-loathing, I think even when he hears constructive criticism it gets violent inside himself towards himself. And that\u2019s something that he has to work on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: And I did. I felt a little okay because I was like, \u201cActually, Ivan, I would like you to notice, even if you\u2019re not feeling it, the trash really is overdue and so is the laundry and I haven\u2019t said a word about either of them. I stopped criticizing. I even mostly never ask and wait for it to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">happen,\u201d because it eventually will happen and he\u2019s getting better. Also, there is a part of me that realizes it\u2019s not worth arguing over, especially if this week he did five \u2013 well, maybe not quite five (laughs) \u2013 but he did things on his to-do list without being asked that were really important and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200892\">he took care of some stuff all on his own; and that\u2019s really huge. It doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t have clean clothes or not, but it\u2019s big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: In the grand scheme of things, it is so much more important, in a way, than if the trash is overflowing.  This is, I think, one of the things that happened in your childhood, Ramona, is that the big things that really matter were so not happening for you as children that you naturally became <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">preoccupied, even with some of the smaller things \u2013 like everything that was not in order became important. If you had an experience where the big things like seeing you and loving you and putting your mind first were happening, the overflowing garbage, even if that\u2019s something that your parents needed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B2\">to work on still, would not have felt as important inside. Do you know what I mean? It was sort of like, \u201cOkay, so it overflows one day.\u201d That\u2019s not world disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: It feels like what I can control is of paramount importance and what I can\u2019t control has to be less important, even if it\u2019s really the most important because I go crazy sometimes. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: The garbage is even something you could even go just take out and you could actually then fix the problem. You can\u2019t fix their minds.  You can\u2019t change who they are, but you can take the garbage out. And I think as things have been evolving with Ivan where he is taking responsibility for <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F1\">his part of things in his own mind \u2013 and there are parts of his mind that are clearly changing because of the big things that he has been approaching \u2013 then the garbage starts to feel like it\u2019s not quite as important as it used to be. It\u2019s still important; it\u2019s part of the daily tasks of living and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F2\">you might still get irritated by it and it still remains an issue. You wouldn\u2019t be the first or last couple for whom it happens that the garbage and laundry are things people fight about, and yet it\u2019s not the level of importance inside as it was as a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve also tried to take your advice sometimes when I look at \u201coh, the recycling is overflowing.\u201d Last night I was really tired and I left dirty dishes in the sink and I didn\u2019t switch out the dishwasher. It can happen. It\u2019s not the end of the world and it doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t happen the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200911\">next day.

He hadn\u2019t really done a lot of cleaning during <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A51\">the week so I pretty much ended up doing almost all of it and I was like, \u201cYou know, I feel a little triggered by that,\u201d because I literally had a couple of nightmares Friday night or Saturday night. I was at my parents\u2019 house and people came over and I was so embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A52\">It wasn\u2019t clean and I never could get it done. It was very realistic, although this is why it never happens. I just said to him, \u201cYou know, I think you\u2019ve been doing all the cooking and I do almost all the cleaning. Why don\u2019t we think of ways to split it up more so that neither of us feels like we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A53\">doing all of one thing?\u201d Even that felt good, but I was aware that that could feel repetitive for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really important. Did you say that you just talked to your mom? Was it in there somewhere? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t long ago. It was a couple of days ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Okay. So before you had people over? And as you\u2019re dreaming about this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">CLIENT: We didn\u2019t talk about the house at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t even have to be concretely talked about, the house, but even the house as a metaphor for the amount of cleaning up of messiness and other people\u2019s crap that you had to do in order to survive. Do you know what I mean? That\u2019s like a stripping and cleaning is that the house is a metaphor <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF1\">of your family. There can be shame about bringing people to a messy house if you\u2019re feeling like what\u2019s inside us is messy, what\u2019s here is not good. There are things that we need to be hiding.  I\u2019m sure, for example, your friends coming over, it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world to them at all if it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF2\">weren\u2019t as clean as you probably got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B1\">CLIENT: No. No. But now I\u2019m really self-conscious about it and I sometimes catch myself really intensely cleaning something; and I think it\u2019s because I had to. Our house really was that dirty. Our apartment really isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t have to (scoffs) scrub the floor on my hands and knees. I can just take <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B11\">a mop over it. It\u2019s not that dirty, but I guess I\u2019m stuck in that a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s such a sign of just how much anxiety you were sitting with as a kid, Ramona, like the kind of almost OCD personative quality \u2013 try and get it clean; try and get it clean \u2013 when, in fact, what you are trying to get clean is the family. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B5\">CLIENT: Right. For me, though, it also felt psychologically cleansing if even a thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yes. That\u2019s what OCD is, right? The feeling I go wash my hands and, if I make sure that they\u2019re extremely clean and I\u2019ve cleaned them ten times with soap and water, there is a kind of cleansing of something internally \u2013 temporarily. It doesn\u2019t last, but it can feel like something is <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B71\">clean and pristine and in order inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B9\">CLIENT: But I guess sometimes I can think if you were to have an argument and, at the end of it, you can fix the argument or fix the outcome, but in my mind it feels different if the argument takes place at my parents\u2019 house the way it was or if it takes place in a really clean environment, which I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B91\">know is bizarre and it sounds super weird to verbalize it, but it feels like at the end of the day, if you could square things away with the argument you could also not feel like your life is a mess or your house is a mess.  Even if things are relatively okay, I can feel like if I go home and the apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B92\">is really neat and tidy like it is right now, I feel less stressed and I don\u2019t feel guilty relaxing. I actually feel like I can\u2019t enjoy relaxing at all if the apartment is a mess. I feel like ugh, it\u2019s a waste of time to even try to relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You clean, in a way, and get things clean as a strategy to manage your anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">CLIENT: Right. I think it\u2019s the same like if I\u2019m going to have this problem with Ivan and this problem with my family, but I\u2019m going to get A\u2019s while it\u2019s happening or I\u2019m going to clean the apartment or the house while it\u2019s happening. At the end of the two years I\u2019ll at least have my degree, even if <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD1\">whatever happens with Ivan. I\u2019m not going to let him take that away from me or I\u2019m at least going to have my apartment in order.  I\u2019m not going to let someone take that away from me. I can control what I can and, to some extent, I feel really good about that strategy because if it hadn\u2019t been, I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD2\">have eventually gotten out of that house, but I might not have been able to do as well in college or go onto grad school or whatever if I hadn\u2019t kept myself going with those mechanisms.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. As far as defenses are concerned, it\u2019s one of the most adaptive defenses, right? It really is better than the defense of sticking your head in the sand. It kind of leads to some more adaptive steps in life. The part that\u2019s really important about it \u2013 everyone needs defenses, Ramona. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF1\">There is anxiety in life. We can\u2019t take away having anxiety. People have job interviews. They have things that are on the line. They have death coming. Life is filled with anxiety that we use defenses around all the time \u2013even at the end of a good psychotherapy you want to have some defenses. The difference <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF2\">is when you think your defenses are the right answer versus being able to say what you\u2019re starting to say: this is what I do to manage my anxiety. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s right all the time, but it\u2019s a part of what soothes you. That takes the edge off of the hostile part of criticism towards your <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF3\">parents \u2013 or towards Ivan, even, around some of this stuff. The way that he manages anxiety is not as adaptive, but it\u2019s also just the way he manages anxiety. His way of dealing with things not going well and being messy is to put his head in the sand and that\u2019s how he gets rid of the feelings. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF4\">way produces more problems in the long run.  Your way gets things more in order, but they don\u2019t have to be in as much order in order for things to be good. If you ultimately still want them in so much order, more power to you. This is where it just becomes individual differences, too, but it\u2019s different <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF5\">than recognizing that as an individual difference versus the absolutely right answer and that it has to be this thing in order to relax. The loosening that happens when you get to say \u201cI\u2019m going to still relax tonight, even though the dishes aren\u2019t done. Let\u2019s see if I can just do that and have life <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF6\">still feel okay \u2013 really get into this movie and enjoy it.\u201d (pause) You\u2019re smiling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C1\">CLIENT: Do we have any time left?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Five minutes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C5\">CLIENT: There is something else that was on my mental laundry list of what I kind of wanted to ask you about today. This is another random aside, but after Valentine\u2019s Day, Ivan was like, \u201cI want to make Friday night date night, even if we just eat dinner together and watch a movie or we go out. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C51\">I should plan that for at least a month and that would be really nice.\u201d So Friday night I got home and he made a really nice dinner. He rented The Great Gatsby, which I love, and it was really nice. So he\u2019s doing that and that\u2019s really sweet. He still hasn\u2019t written anything, but that\u2019s really sweet. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C52\">There was another night where he and I had dinner, because he\u2019s making dinner pretty consistently, and I was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we read together for a while? Why don\u2019t you sit here on the bed with me?\u201d And that was nice.  Then I was like, \u201cIvan, what would happen if we tried to both sleep in the bed tonight?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C53\">because I am getting to feel more and more like I would like him to sleep in the bed. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m looking for an excuse, like he\u2019s always dragging out a blanket and a pillow to the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s starting to not feel right sometimes?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C9\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t feel right. This may sound bizarre, but it bothers me on a certain level; like I wipe down the couch Sunday because he had slept on the couch and my friends are coming over. I keep doing that and it reminds me of times when I cleaned up my mom\u2019s bedroom area on the couch in the living <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C91\">room, which was horrible. That\u2019s not a good reason for him to sleep in the bed \u2013 because it\u2019s messy or because it\u2019s a reminder of that, but I\u2019m feeling more and more safe with him. It\u2019s definitely more in a friendship mode\u2019 but I feel good about that, regaining a lot of trust and having good times together, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C92\">even if we\u2019re not making out.  Sitting on the couch together and holding hands or just sitting close, I felt good about it. But then I was a little unsure, so he slept under the covers but over the sheet and I was like okay, I feel good about that. I feel a little more safe and we agreed to that. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C93\">seems silly, but it\u2019s also still scary, even though we were comfortable and sitting there reading together. I woke up in the middle of the night and I just realized his hand had brushed against my back. I had my back to him; I sleep on my side. He was sleeping on his other side, so we kind of had our <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C94\">backs to each other. I felt his hand on my butt and then up to my back. I woke up to that and I kind of panicked, because I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He was half awake, he said, and he said, \u201cI just remember pulling my hand away. I don\u2019t even remember . . . I think I was just moving around.\u201d I genuinely <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C95\">got worked up because I was like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. What if my back hadn\u2019t been to him and I just feel paranoid.  I was also impressed because he immediately stood up and I was like, \u201cWhat are you supposed to be doing in this situation?\u201d and he named off three steps that he and Dr. Bourd had developed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C96\">questions that he\u2019s supposed to ask himself, including \u201cwhat are the consequences of doing this?\u201d \u2013 things to bring him into reality. I was actually very impressed because, not only did he just wake up and kind of recite those immediately, they were at the top of his mind, he said he was tossing and <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C97\">turning for hours. He was like, \u201cI knew what a big deal this was and was just wanting it to go well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200CB\">THERAPIST: He knew what a big deal it was just to even be in the bed, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200CD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200CF\">THERAPIST: So it was hard to fall asleep, almost, because of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what he said. I think I went right to sleep.  So I got scared. I got spooked by that, so since then he\u2019s been sleeping on the couch again. But I keep going back to thinking that I\u2019m a really big fool and absolutely nothing has changed and this is just another version. It\u2019s going back <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200D11\">to the way it was. Or he really did just move around in the night and it\u2019s not horrible. I would like him to sleep in the bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I she saying he was asleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D5\">CLIENT: He was saying that he was half awake. He was saying, \u201cI was only even half-awake enough to realize that I was pulling my hand away. I don\u2019t even remember putting my hand anywhere. I just remember pulling it back.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And you felt it on your butt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200DB\">THERAPIST: The palm or like a finger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200DD\">CLIENT: He was sleeping like this and this happened sort of, but then he immediately pulled it . . . He did immediately pull it away and it kind of went up to my back. So it seems like a very legitimate explanation but, of course, I can\u2019t tell the difference between paranoia and . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200DF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so hard anyway because people rolling around in the middle of the night could end up in all sorts of limbs accidentally in your sleep.  I think it\u2019s more a matter of what is he knowing or saying about it inside of himself. That\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to trust. It felt like you had a sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200DF1\">of it being accidental or like a hand was being pulled away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E1\">CLIENT: It was definitely getting pulled away, I think. He was like, \u201cAll I remember was realizing quickly where my hand was and pulling it away. I don\u2019t remember putting it there.\u201d And I said, \u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t tell. I could make an equal argument for it feeling like it was put there intentionally <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200E11\">versus unintentionally.\u201d I really can\u2019t tell and I feel like I\u2019m too . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E3\">THERAPIST: And you could imagine him pulling it away? Let\u2019s say he\u2019s asleep and all of a sudden he wakes up and goes, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d (both chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E5\">CLIENT: Or I can imagine him going through the same thing and being like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this again.\u201d So that\u2019s why I . . . But it has been two months and it doesn\u2019t feel quite right and I do want to build things up, even if we\u2019re not ready to have sex yet, which I don\u2019t know that we are. I would still <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200E51\">like for him to be able to sleep in the bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E7\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve asked him this, but I would be curious that night if, as he was lying tossing and turning, was he aware or even, at some point later in the night after he woke up, I would be interested to know if he at all felt tempted to touch you. Did that come up? Did he have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200E71\">use the skills? Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Because that will also give you kind of a guidepost about \u2013 I don\u2019t know if he would admit it even if he was \u2013 but it\u2019s still worth asking. How prominent was this that he was dealing with it? I can imagine that the decision \u201cyou can sleep in the bed,\u201d given what happened last time how close <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200EB1\">you\u2019re getting.  When I\u2019m being close, is that triggering something more for him? I would just be curious what his response to that would be as part of your trying to continue to understand and build trust on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200ED\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s not necessarily a good idea to just let him start sleeping in the bed again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I want to get more data about what happened first. Again, even if he is going to say, \u201cOh, no, no, no. That was nothing. I was half asleep.\u201d I would still want to know: did it come up? What was it like for you lying there? Were you tempted? What was keeping him awake, for example? It is a <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200EF1\">big deal, but I would still be curious: what was so much of a big deal inside him that it was keeping him awake? Do you know what I mean? And you\u2019ll feel that out. Even one week at a time, you can keep coming in and talking about what feels right. I think what\u2019s important, Ramona, is that you\u2019re listening <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200EF2\">to your inner self \u2013 even including that your inner self said \u201clet\u2019s try it tonight\u201d is really important.  And then if the next night felt like \u201clet\u2019s not try it tonight; let\u2019s kind of regroup and talk about this a little bit,\u201d you can keep doing that day by day and doing what feels like it\u2019s appropriate <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200EF3\">to where you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735370\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200F1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200F3\">THERAPIST: All right?
