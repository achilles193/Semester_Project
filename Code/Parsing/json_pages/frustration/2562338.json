It\u2019s not important. OK. So, we were going to talk a little bit about process. And I was laughing about this after I left on Thursday last week, because that is what I imagined we would do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">when I first showed up and have been \u2013 I mean, maybe \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how explicit it was, and I\u2019m not sure how calculated your aversion to doing this may or may not have been, but \u2013 and it was funny.  It was funny, all of a sudden, three years in, to have what I \u2013 what was my referent when you were talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">about, you know, instrumental interventions. Suddenly, we were at ten (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">Yeah, so it was \u2013 I mean, it was a little amusing and a little bit surprising, I guess. It didn\u2019t seem like that big a deal, and I guess, you know, it\u2019s possible that we simply either had a miscommunication or that you had a sense that other things were more important or a higher priority. But I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">always imagined when I came in, having difficulty working, which we agree is somewhat more complex than that.  That this is what the person who recommended you to me thought that you were very good at doing, is working through, you know, difficulties in the work process and kind of identifying where <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">the blockages were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">So, for the last three years, we\u2019ve been doing the preamble \u2013 this was the joke. You know, for the last three years, we\u2019ve been doing the preamble to \u2013 or two and a half...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Right, and the other day, it felt like I was saying, \u201cOh yeah, and by the way...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: \u201cAnd by the way,\u201d yeah, \u201cWe might as well...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:38) talked about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, yeah...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, being (inaudible at 00:02:45).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s easier. I mean, you know, I guess that\u2019s part of the joke too, is that, you know, is \u2013 but when I was feeling frustrated, I can say that, you know, when I was kind of, I don\u2019t know, feeling a little bit of cross-purposes, what I imagined would be the alternative was something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">like this.  Whatever, it\u2019s fine. Other things. (pause) There is a \u2013 the departmental secretary. So, you know, there are so many hierarchies at Harvard, it\u2019s hard to keep track of all of them. But one of the hierarchies is, you know, kind of bureaucratic, you know, on the bureaucratic side of the hierarchy <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">and on academic or the scholastic side of the faculty of the enterprise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">There are two very long standing people. One of whom, Nikki, you know, I\u2019ve known ever since the non-profit came to Harvard in, like, \u201899 or 2000. I think she was the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: [She and Harvard] (ph) being partners?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: ... partners at the time. So, she was the, I think she was the secretary, executive assistant or something, of the old chair. Not Arthur Kleinman, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Happened in med school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: ... but Byron Good. Right. So, at the end of the Department of Social Medicine, there were a bunch of anthropologists, just one of the interesting features of this particular department.  And I think she was their secretary, and then she became the department\u2019s kind of bureaucratic person. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">then, at some point, for reasons that I don\u2019t know about but must\u2019ve been significant, she was kind of replaced. So she remained in a relatively inferior position underneath Jennifer (ph), who seemed to have taken over around some time in 2005.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">And I don\u2019t know what the story is, but, she\u2019s, you know, an extremely nice person, you know. We\u2019ve known each other in a very casual way for quite some time. And I had a very nice relationship with Jennifer as well, but Nikki I\u2019ve known for a while.  Anyway, so she wrote four weeks ago or so saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">\u201cYou know, I know you left PIH. I got this note from Gene, but, you know, your appointment \u2013 so long as you feel like teaching,\u201d and she didn\u2019t put it like that. She said, you know, \u201cAssuming, you know, you\u2019re involved in teaching responsibilities, you can preserve the appointment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">And the appointment is worth something. It costs something and it\u2019s worth something. I mean, it costs something to the department, because they have to keep my affiliations current and, you know, they pay Harvard something for all of their electorships. You know, I feel very, very disappointed by having <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">it fogged off on me, and don\u2019t really understand \u2013 I guess it\u2019s not about I don\u2019t understand why it was played the way that it was, but, you know, it\u2019s worth something.  And yet, I find myself in a great deal of difficulty responding to this very nice person, whom I\u2019ve known for a long, long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And my impulse, I find, as I reflect on it, is your \u2013 yeah, is just not to be responsive at all. And I\u2019m not sure what to say or do about it, like, I don\u2019t want to respond to Nikki in, you know, a kind of hurt or, you know, or angry or whatever way. I just kind of want to leave it \u2013 I\u2019m not sure. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">don\u2019t \u2013 I find myself a little bit in-articulate describing it. Anyway, she wrote again on Thursday or Friday saying, you know, \u201cJust want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d you know, \u201cThis is a decision making process,\u201d very brief, matter-of-fact e-mail.  And I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure I understand where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">I am with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">So I guess that\u2019s the other, you know, kind of psycho-dramatic item that presents itself to me today. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m opting out a lot or I\u2019m finding it very difficult to respond to people right now, in general. I was writing \u2013 you know, we\u2019ve probably reached the end of the grace period for thank-you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">notes, even with a baby. So, you know, for the last three or four weeks, I\u2019ve continually said, \u201cOK. Well, you know, tonight, we need to do thank-you notes\u201d or \u201cTomorrow, we need to do thank-you notes,\u201d and I\u2019ve had difficulty doing them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">And I sat down to do them this afternoon, and found that I just couldn\u2019t get any traction on it.  And that felt like a subset somehow or related somehow to my difficulty responding to Nikki and I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s curious. So, I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m ruminating on. Not to evade the delightful task of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">minutely examining why it\u2019s difficult for me to do this other kind of communication, but maybe it\u2019s not diversion at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: (long pause) What do you mean when you said that this is being fogged off on you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: The disappointment. I think that sounds less descriptive than I would\u2019ve want it to be, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You may have to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: ...they \u2013 you know, it \u2013 I was offered a position. I talked to Jennifer, the Senior Administrator about it. She said \u2013 all systems seemed go, and then they got back to me and said, you know, \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to make you this other appointment.\u201d And it turns out not to be useful to me, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">at all academically, you know, when the premise was that I would get X (ph). So, and then I talked to the, you know, Chair of the Department, and she\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, you know, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d And it turns out to matter a great deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right. OK. So this was the instructor versus the lecturer kind of thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, electorship was not useful and I knew it. I mean, you know, I \u2013 we\u2019ve probably talked about it the day that it came in. You know, it was apparent to me that something was up, and that something could only be annoying. And indeed, it turned out to be very annoying, indeed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">So that\u2019s what I meant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: (pause) So, even though this has in a way nothing to do with Nikki, it\u2019s a pretty sore spot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Except that, you know, I\u2019m having an identical response to the thank-you notes, which are not in a sore spot in the slightest, indeed. You know, I mean, I\u2019m having the same reaction to the thank-you notes and I\u2019m having the same reaction to the job \u2013 I mean, you know, it\u2019s like there\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">going on here that, you know, significantly transcends this particular, rather sore spot or not transcends a spot, it might be a mixed metaphor, but you know what I\u2019m saying. I mean, it\u2019s not \u2013 it really \u2013 on the one hand, yes. It\u2019s a sore spot.  I can understand, you know, theoretically why I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">be reluctant to, you know, enter into this complexity and not really sure at some level how to respond, given that it\u2019s certainly not Nikki\u2019s fault in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">It\u2019s almost like (chuckles) \u2013 I mean, Nikki is like a paragon of a situation in which nobody claims responsibility for any of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: You know? I mean, it\u2019s not her fault. It\u2019s not, you know, Esther, the Department Chair\u2019s fault. You know, it\u2019s not Frederick Paulson\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not Phil\u2019s fault. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault, you know. It\u2019s, like, \u201cWell, you know, you got screwed, but it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault.\u201d And so, I\u2019m aware at some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">level, I guess, of how inappropriate it would be for all of this, you know, no-faultness to somehow come to rest on Nikki, who I suspect has kind of gotten screwed by, you know, a system that doesn\u2019t respond very well to, you know, meek, very nice, non-aggressive people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">And then, in another sense, it has nothing to do with any of this and is some kind of global reaction that I\u2019m having to the prospect of being out of our household and, you know, in the larger world where you have to interact with people. And not that \u2013 but whom can\u2019t function simultaneously, but they seem to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: ... be on totally different plains. I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m puzzled...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: OK (ph), so you\u2019re saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: One of the things I\u2019m puzzled about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: ... your feeling about the thank-you notes is really quite different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: No. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: My reaction to the thank-you notes...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And doing the writing is the same...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: ... is almost identical, but I don\u2019t know. Yeah. These are people that I feel \u2013 there\u2019s one \u2013 I don\u2019t know.  I mean, I guess if I were pressed on it, I could come up with a scenario in which there\u2019s kind of a slightly analogous situation, insofar, as the most pressing and urgent of the thank-you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">notes, which is the one that I began with today is to my parents\u2019 old friend Deena (ph), who\u2019s dying of cancer, actively and not willingly. You know, so she was diagnosed right before Grayson (ph) was born with Stage IV ovarian cancer, I can\u2019t remember. And she was just talking and, you know, she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200612\">a poet, widely published. It\u2019s a little new age-y for my tastes, but, you know, very accomplished and well regarded. And she\u2019s a psychotherapist, as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">And she said, I had an exchange with her, you know, right after I found out on Facebook, of all places.  I don\u2019t \u2013 I absolutely cannot understand why somebody would do that, that would talk about their treatment on Facebook. It just seems very, very foreign to \u2013 I don\u2019t know understand these things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">But at any rate \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Being (ph) so public?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s, like, I don\u2019t know why it seems so strange to me, but it\u2019s \u2013 I have, I guess, a cultural aversion to those kind of things. At any rate, so we had an exchange about it. And she said, \u201cYeah, you know, I just want to get all of the work that I could possibly get done, done. And so, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">I\u2019m going to have them do everything.\u201d So she had chemo, and then she had surgery, and now she\u2019s looking at another round of chemo. And she\u2019s \u2013 my mother talked to her a couple days ago, I guess, and she\u2019s just doing everything, and doing really badly, and feeling like complete shit.  And it\u2019s hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">for me to \u2013 I\u2019m very surprised to find that it\u2019s very difficult for me to figure out how to interact with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">I sent her a bong...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: A what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: ... and she never...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I just didn\u2019t hear you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: A bong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Oh, bong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: And she never acknowledged it. And I guess maybe that\u2019s part of it. I thought it would be a cute thing and \u2013 because risks or anything like that, it\u2019s risky, but she never acknowledged it. And I\u2019m just not \u2013 I feel uncertain about it and I think that because that\u2019s the most urgent for, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">kind of life cycle reasons at this point, of all the thank-you notes. It\u2019s always at the front of the row as possible, I guess, with my uncertainty or unease about this communication.  And I just postponed all of them, because as I recall, as I think about it, I didn\u2019t really have any problem with any <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">of the other ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">Anyway, but I\u2019m just speculating. I really don\u2019t know. So I guess, I mean, if that\u2019s the analysis, if we don\u2019t look for anything, you know, more baroque or complex or interesting, then I guess you could say that all of these three writing projects, so to speak, have some unease, uncertainty, worries, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">what\u2019s the other one? Yeah, I guess the worry. If I was creating a taxonomy, I\u2019d say that the worry resides with, you know, how \u2013 whether I\u2019ll be able to, you know, prepare a face to meet the faces that I meet with all of the recipients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I guess I\u2019m not \u2013 it\u2019d make more sense to me, in terms of what we talked about, that you\u2019d have trouble writing Nikki back. Having the \u2013 your frustration, your feeling of being fucked over, the sort of way that you\u2019re also, you know, kind of being silenced about that, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">nobody\u2019s taking responsibility and because Nikki generally doesn\u2019t have any, and she\u2019s nice.  You know, that all feels (ph) familiar. I\u2019m not clear about kind of where the struggle of anxiety is with. Deena? Was that her name? In that, I get that you\u2019re sort of on uncertain footing with her, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200792\">is how it sounds. She never...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: And she was very \u2013 I mean, she sent this \u2013 we had this very sweet communication. And I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You seem to have a clearer sense than I do of what might be making it difficult to write to her. Is it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, I\u2019m trying, just for the sake of argument, to create a taxonomy that might include it. And what \u2013 you\u2019re a little dissatisfied, I guess, with the generality, you know, the degree of generalization that is required.  But I guess I\u2019m seeing something that I identify as unease, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">you\u2019re responding, well \u2013 it\u2019s the specific kind of unease that we\u2019ve been talking about, you know, that involves anger, I guess. You know, and anger...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Anger, injustice and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, OK. Fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: ... feeling silenced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Fine. Sure. I mean, you know, the anger has all these things associated with it. Outrage, maybe outrage is better, and, you know, your response to how \u2013 I mean, I suppose you could really stretch it and say, \u201cWell, you know, getting terminal cancer is very unjust,\u201d and, you know, you\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">quite sure how to relate and I\u2019m \u2013 I [that makes up] (ph) the excess failure.  You know, and I am not quite sure how to relate to that injustice and how to compose myself in response to it. And the default reaction to that uncertainty or trouble or anxiety or, you know, kind of difficulty composing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">myself is to have difficulty composing in an expository sense as well, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: You mean in that case, you\u2019re sort of reacting about the injustice done to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Done to her, yeah. I mean, the injustice of the universe. I don\u2019t know. That seems a little bit farfetched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t have the sense from things you said that \u2013 I mean, like, you\u2019re upset, but not disturbed by what\u2019s happened to her. I mean, it\u2019s when you said so far that indicates, right (ph), it gives me a sense that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: ... you\u2019re sort of disturbed by it. I\u2019m sort of agreeing with you that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: ... you know, that seems like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, a bit of a stretch. Seems like it is a stretch. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine. And, you know, whenever you write something, you must imagine the other person, and what they look like, and who they are. And it\u2019s \u2013 you know, like, what comes to mind, I guess, is thinking about my dad <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">in the last phase, when, you know, he had no air and was swollen by the chemotherapy and all these things. So and \u2013 Deena is kind of a lipstick lesbian. She\u2019s very, you know, well put together. She\u2019s my mother\u2019s age, she\u2019s only 60. She\u2019s very chic, and it gets pretty hard, like, to think of her hanging <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200972\">on by her fingernails like that. There\u2019s some of that. There\u2019s something there, but it feels like a very different thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">And so I\u2019m confused to some degree by, you know, the \u2013 my initial confusion, I think, you know, is still obtained. It\u2019s not \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been resolved by our \u2013 by my particularly fumbling attempts to kind of create a taxonomy that includes all of these things. And at some level, you know, the task of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">figuring out what it is exactly that I do when I sit down and can\u2019t do it is, you know, well served, but trying to understand is weird. Conversion (ph) seems very, very difficult. They\u2019re all things I have to do this week, like, now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe this is not job applications per se, but these are all \u2013 all of these things must be done before the end of the week. You know, there\u2019s no [cutting around] (ph). (00:25:00) (long pause) What\u2019s \u2013 can I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: ...break in? What\u2019s the complexity that you\u2019re \u201cHmm-ing,\u201d about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, at the moment, I\u2019m sort of (pause) \u2013 I guess I am skeptical of the premise that there is some kind of general or, like, super-ordinate reason that you\u2019re having trouble moving forward on these three projects involving writing, with, like... (00:26:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: This is reminding me of a Rorschach test that I took, where it was just, like, this incredibly complex inkblot. And I think the expectation is that somebody would go through it, and they would say, \u201cOh, OK. Well, this reminds of that, and this reminds me of that, and this reminds me of the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">thing.\u201d And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: How big was the inkblot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, it was, you know, it had a number of different facets to it. It\u2019s like that \u2013 I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: I remember them showing me, like, this is my recollection of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I mean, the standard administration is, like, you know, they\u2019re about that big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Something, the blot itself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: ... because the paper in there are usually \u2013 you do ten of them. And so you say, like, you know, say what...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: ... you know, what you think it reminds you of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: At any rate, well, this is my recollection, so it really doesn\u2019t matter what it actually was, because I\u2019m \u2013 but in my recollection at least, they showed it to me, and I said, \u201cWell, you know, this looks like something.\u201d And there were, I don\u2019t know, 15 details that were somehow integrated into <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">the same split (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I mean, part of the reason I\u2019m asking about the administration is because, I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter a little bit in that, like \u2013 I mean, I know enough about how those things work. I don\u2019t do that kind of testing, but I \u2013 you know, you sort of get trained in there and you see one of those <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">boards (ph) when you\u2019re starting out. And anyway, so, like, if it was the usual one, it helps \u2013 gives me context for your response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Oh.  Well, I was having \u2013 I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: What were you going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: I went to the counsel, and I was kind of having trouble working, [you know], shortly after my father died. And the guy I was seeing is a very nice guy, asked me if I would be willing to have an inkblot test administered by one of his students or interns or something. And so the guy administered <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">the test, and then \u2013 what was his last name? Donald something, I don\u2019t know. He said, \u201cYeah, your response was very unusual, because of instead of saying...\u201d apparently, you know, there was one very detailed card. And instead of identifying the individual parts, I integrated all of them into one story. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">So, that just reminded me of this effort to find some grand, unified theory of, you know, all physical phenomenon related by the Big Bang. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">At any rate, yeah. No, I hear that skepticism, that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, there may be a (inaudible at 00:29:10) theory, but, like, I guess I think of things tend to arrive kind of from the bottom up, you know, like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess it\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And so when I\u2019m thinking of what I\u2019m trying to do and sort of \u2013 at this point, when I\u2019m, sort of, you know, (inaudible at 00:29:32), but also going through my sense of your, like \u2013 the feeling you have or have expressed about Deena, and what\u2019s going on with her, and who she is, to see if <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">I can get a sense of, like \u2013 I mean, I guess the clearest thing is that she sounds like sort of a vivacious...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Deena...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: ... lively person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: My favorite story about Deena took place at a party in Northwestern in, like, 1968. And she had broken up with somebody and was very depressed. And so, like, for my parents, this party was to \u2013 you know, like, what they were doing the whole party was kind of trying to cheer her up. And so at <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">some point, my father fell asleep on the couch, as he often did. And Deena kind of woke him up in the middle of the night and said, \u201cOh God, you know, I made these brownies and nobody wanted to eat them, and I\u2019m so sad, and I\u2019m so depressed, and nobody loves me.\u201d And she was fucking with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: She put a lot of hash in these brownies. And he wakes up in the middle of the night, you know, like, 45 minutes later, and he\u2019s completely (inaudible at 00:30:46) and he has no idea what\u2019s going on. He just thinks it\u2019s [fucking sick] (ph). (laughing) He didn\u2019t speak to her for, like, a year after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Oh my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: (laughing). Yeah. I mean, and whatever. She\u2019s now [better of] (ph) a woman of 68, and that\u2019s all of these other ways of expressing herself, since she was, like, in her 20\u2019s.  And anyway, so, yeah, she was a very vivacious person. She\u2019s always been a bit of trip, you know. She has all of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">stuff about goddesses and I mean, you know, she\u2019s new age-y. She\u2019s new age-y. So not \u2013 some of what she writes is not quite tralatitious (ph). She\u2019s a wonderful translator, and she\u2019s translated some very \u2013 she did Paul Celan. I mean, she did some, you know, very well-known people to do a translation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D92\">You need to get the copy-write so they don\u2019t, you know, give it to just anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">So, yeah, you know \u2013 yeah, so it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t feel trauma, you know, it\u2019s like, you know, when my father was dying, I was, you know, deeply traumatized.  Deena being sick is very sad, and I feel bad about it, and I want to make her happy to the extent that I can. And I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB1\">miss out, you know. So I guess there is some natural reasons why it\u2019s hard to write back, and there\u2019s probably some residual grief with my father. They were very \u2013 they knew each other well. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does seem like a sort of injustice.

It\u2019s hopeless, fighting it. My mother, I talked to my mother last night or this morning or something, and she\u2019s, like, you know, she\u2019s a little traumatized too, I\u2019m sure, helping (ph) my dad through it. Anyway, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And you said you had a very nice interaction with her, though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Very \u2013 you know, she didn\u2019t write back after the bong, but that\u2019s her prerogative. I mean, whatever. It was kind of a far out gift, and maybe she just didn\u2019t want to get into all that. I didn\u2019t feel dissed. We haven\u2019t had communication since then, but I didn\u2019t feel particularly dissed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And the interaction with her was, like \u2013 did she \u2013 I don\u2019t know where she is now, like, did she come...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Idaho.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Oh, OK.

She wrote some, like, you know, very brief, four line children\u2019s poems for him, very sweet ones, very, very sweet ones. And I asked Isaac (ph), my nephew, to illustrate a few of them, and he did two or three. So, I mean, I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">Marshall (ph).

I mean, it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: ... grand, encompassing thing. It\u2019s just these are the three things that feel most urgent to me, right now. That all three of them, I feel some remorse over not having superseded whatever it is that\u2019s interfering. And, you know, when talking about the \u2013 I mean, I guess, you know, in a more kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201031\">of nitty-gritty sense, I really haven\u2019t been successful at all at sitting down to do the job applications or at least I\u2019ve made, you know, the college try at the thank-you notes. So if I\u2019m going to talk about any kind (laughing) of processes, this is what I have in hand, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: All right. Also, [this is how I feel it] (ph), is this \u2013 could this be the last thing you write to her? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: Or the last communication...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: Easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: ... you have with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: It could. It could. I\u2019m writing a letter to her, I\u2019m not sending her a card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Just about what\u2019s going on. I just didn\u2019t want to be limited by the card, the format of a card. But it\u2019s hard. And if I had written it three months ago, we would\u2019ve had a dialog, and I wouldn\u2019t have \u2013 feel so much responsibility, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Three months ago was before was diagnosed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: No, no, no. Three months ago was three months ago, shortly after she sent this package.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:47).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so we took a picture of Grayson, and things that she (inaudible 00:35:53). And what we\u2019re doing for everybody, but this is \u2013 this one is harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2011A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562338\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: [Hadn\u2019t start then] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, genuinely, well, you know what I \u2013 yeah. So how does it feel (inaudible 00:36:13). I\u2019m having a little trouble getting in touch with it, which may be interesting and it may just be not interesting. I don\u2019t know, like, there\u2019s a distinct feeling of sadness, and I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F1\">quite feeling it, as I talk to you about it. I feel more distanced from that sensation than, for example, the sensation of being outraged about the bait and switch with the \u2013 which, some of it feels very awful to me, like, why should I have any difficulty with a real emotion, when some bullshit, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F2\">know, stupid, institutional hoo-ha.  But maybe I\u2019ve answered my own question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, but that\u2019s sort of the first thing that sounded plausible to me, like, about Deena, as something you\u2019re having trouble expressing. Does that matter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: I wouldn\u2019t quite say that.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had, in the last half hour, trouble expressing the sadness, but I have had trouble actually feeling it. In other words, I\u2019m aware that I feel it. I\u2019m aware of why I feel it. Intellectually, I have no difficulty, and I have no difficulty saying that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201231\">I\u2019m sad, but I don\u2019t feel it right here now, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s sort of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: ... that\u2019s a little weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: ... what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah, OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I agree with all those things you said. I mean, it doesn\u2019t seem to me like you\u2019re not being clear about it or that you\u2019re unaware of it, but there\u2019s some contact with it that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Missing, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: And then, I guess I think of \u2013 in a way, as a kind of very direct expression of it, you know, like if somebody cries, that\u2019s expressing sadness.  Do you know what I mean, like \u2013 or if you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: But you\u2019ve noticed, it\u2019s often when I feel a strong emotion or at least sometimes when I feel a strong emotion, I will cry, but I still won\u2019t feel it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You know, anyway, my point was to link that with the difficulty of writing to her. I mean, this is the first thing that seems like it has the kind of emotional heft and the sense of blockage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: But we should stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, OK. OK. So I\u2019ll see you on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: OK. I was going to show you the latest picture, but that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s not a very urgent thing.

I didn\u2019t walk in with a \u2013 I walked in with a book, but not with a jacket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: I just [don\u2019t know] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: OK.
