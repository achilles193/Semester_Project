Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: We\u2019ll make a decision formally in about two hours but I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019ll be here on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Okay. Well, I\u2019ll be glad to see you but I\u2019m sorry that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: You\u2019re sorry [we can\u2019t go camping] (ph).

Thank you. It\u2019s kind of you to say so. (laughs) (pause) So today was a very hard day between me and Jennie (sp?) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: And finally we I don\u2019t know, we had a very good interaction that seems to have sort of taken a lot of the tension out. Shortly before I came here. And I think (pause) it would not have happened had I not just been very My senses that it was important to say. (phone rings) Sorry!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\"> To say sort of articulately what the stakes were. Does that make sense? I basically said, \u201cListen, we have these two gifts. We have this magical child.\u201d And who knows what he picks up on but if you preserve and nurture this kind of tension it can\u2019t be good for a little person who not every baby is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">so easy going, not every person feels secure enough to interact the way he does. And I think both of us feel it and feel a kind of responsibility to the universe for whatever (laughs) to nurture it and you know, the other gift that we have is finding someone who fits so well. I think I said something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">like, \u201cWe\u2019re at the point we can really do damage to that (ph) if we continue to kind of lash out at each other.\u201d It was good. It was very it was well placed and it was helpful so I felt kind of relieved that (inaudible at 0:03:02) please interaction (inaudible at 00:03:05). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">The fact remains that all the things that we\u2019ve been talking about, almost (inaudible at 00:03:16) at this point, still there, so it doesn\u2019t change that. But on the other hand, I don\u2019t know, I guess that among other things, I felt pleased that even while being abandonment, fear, and being angry and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">knowing that I\u2019m not great about expressing it in an effective way that I was able to kind of abstract from that and use the skills that I have as an adult to affect the environment. So that was good. I feel a sense of satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: As well as It sucks to be locked in a conflict with two partners. Not fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: (laughs) It\u2019s not enjoyable at all. (pause) (sighs) Grayson woke up at about 5:05 this morning so pretty deep. It was so early that even he felt like it was too early. Usually when he gets up, whatever the time is, he\u2019s like smiling and laughing and interacting and this time he got up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">I put him in the activity center and he was like (Makes unhappy noise) (laughs) [bats at something,] (ph) doesn\u2019t make eye contact, \u201cPlease put me back to bed,\u201d which eventually ultimately did but God, relaxing enough that you can put an infant to bed when you\u2019re completely dead, not easy. It\u2019s an accomplishment <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">Anyway.

Not in a terrible way but it\u2019s like, who\u2019s going to get more of what they want? And I guess maybe it\u2019s not good that it\u2019s formulate between us in those terms and I certainly in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">the course of this interaction over the last few months have been dissatisfied with Jennie\u2019s constant insistence on zero someness (ph) as the guiding metaphor. Although it\u2019s funny, I had a conversation with my sister who has also just had a baby and who also has a husband and who also (laughs) and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">she said, she was both describing the struggle, their kind of daily dynamic between them, in very very similar terms and she said, \u201cYeah, I put it too him in exactly the same way, there\u2019s a zero sum game. Either you take the baby or I take the baby.\u201d (laughs) There\u2019s no two ways about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I think part of what has been difficult is that I feel like the formulation is more profound, rightly or wrongly, I feel like the formulation is more profound than simply who gets the hour between three o\u2019clock and four o\u2019clock and really extends to who gets to do satisfied work and who gets <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">to Anyway, that was a long digression. (pause) And I forgot where it started. What was I saying? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: That you had been thinking -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard to be in therapy with people who are under slept, isn\u2019t it? (laughs) [This is the slower response] (ph) (inaudible at 00:07:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You said you had been thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah yeah yeah. I had been thinking There is significant cause, part of it is some kind of power struggle, part of it is the natural process of having a baby which involves these kinds tensions intrinsically but part of it is just that I feel this compulsion to express myself in a way <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">Some of it is what I\u2019ve spoken about in the past which is just the sense that this kind of the story of my life and this is the way that I, with my peculiar narrative compulsions, would go about writing this out in a psychologically meaningful manner. But part of it is a sense, is a reflection anyway, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">where the fantasy is You know, I still want to write the thing that I didn\u2019t get to write, or that I was trying to write, when my dissertation took all of these turns and twists. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">There\u2019s some sense of I\u2019m not sure how absurdly I\u2019m willing to put it revelation, artistic impulse, just an urge or compulsion for expression in particular kind or maybe follow through, with as much integrity as possible, on what is for better or worse my way of understanding the world and wanting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">to communicate it to other people. And again, even in the last phase of my dissertation, I allowed myself to be completely diverted by something that postponed it my a year that ultimately my insistence on writing the dissertation or expressing myself in this particular way. Really I think it\u2019s fair <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">to say that it cost me what would have been a very tidy and likely satisfying career because I had been doing this thing and I had been working and I had been with this group of people and I was deeply dissatisfied and sometimes in really profound distress but it was like I had to express myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562350\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">I kept on coming back to the idea of this piece and the piece that I was trying to write then was not certainly what I submitted for the dissertation which it seems that I don\u2019t understand my dilatory genuflections toward academia but apparently I don\u2019t care enough about that iteration of it to actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">try and pursue it in an academic context. (pause) I think at some level I see what I\u2019m doing right now as a truer expression of whatever that compulsion was. That compulsion to self-expression that led me to sacrifice so much. And I think that what was hard or at least striking to me about this train <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">of thought over the last few days was that I felt like maybe I\u2019m doing it again. Like maybe whatever is compelling me to express myself in this way and to prioritize this over smooth relations with Jennie has the potential to cause as much upheaval in my life as the previous iteration of this urge had <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">been. And yet it\u2019s genuine. There\u2019s something very deep and genuine about what I \u2018m trying to do that makes it very difficult for me to say, for example, \u201cwell, let\u2019s put it on hold for the moment.\u201d (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: (Sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It seems like it\u2019s partly about your righting thing, like r-i-g-h-t, righting. Making them right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Okay, how so? And the conceptual framework is still -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah sure. (pause) Feeling bad and kind of unfairly treated in various ways by your workplaces and more recently by Jennie, in this iteration of it I\u2019m talking about I think part of it is the impulse, both between you and them and sort of just between you and you is like, \u201cHey, I need a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">chance to tell my side of it.\u201d I don\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll be literally writing about what specifically has been happening but that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: There\u2019s some of that, I mean, sure, I mean, whatever. Anytime you engage in a project of communication there\u2019s that and I think at various times [my dad] (ph) has been more urgent you know, just like the literal narrative Apologia Pro Vita Sua, you know, just <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:09)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: You know for his life, for your life, it\u2019s the sort of explanation of what happened. It\u2019s not just an autobiographical thing it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, other people might not \u201c This is like a classic genre, you know, other people might not quote, \u201cQuite understand why things happen the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">they did so here I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, I had a little more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: You had more. Oh, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt your train of thought. Because that\u2019s not, that particular urge is kind of not the way whether it\u2019s supplemented in some Baroque way I can\u2019t tell you that\u2019s not quite what I had in mind. It really was more just about telling a story in the way that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">I tell stories and thinking about narrative and history and the Bible and all this stuff and putting it all together in this particular way. And I was reading there\u2019s a historian of very academic and you know, scholarly historian who wrote one very amazing series of lectures right before the second <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">World War that I\u2019d been reading that probably has affected kind of the terms in which I was thinking about it and repeatedly in these lectures, you hear him really give voice to these people who have these bizarre ways of expressing spirituality and philosophy and different kinds of religious expression <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B3\">in intensely literary terms and he constantly zeros in on passages where they say, \u201cI just had to write it all down. I just had to express myself in this particular way.\u201d I just felt myself vibrating <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562350\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Uh-hu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: As I read that. I said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it!\u201d It kinda makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Like they\u2019re possessed with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Something! Something. And every other aspect of their life just has to take a backseat until they can do it and often because they were vaguely or maybe even specifically theoretical they would do it anonymously, there was a cost to doing this. Anyway, so maybe I\u2019m just sort of (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">00:19:55) another story as I read these lectures but it resonated with me. So I think that background is helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah I think that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: And I did have a mystical experience however you think about it when I was in San Diego, I told you about this thing that ended in the zoo with my father. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t know how to think about that particular event but it was kind of expressed somehow in vaguely theological terms and it did have the character of experiences that these people are talking about and it does -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Can you remind me about it? (inaudible overlapping talking at 00:20:36) It was a while ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: So It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine. I had like a break but a break in a weird way. I had been trying to get the dissertation back on the road and I had been living in San Diego and basically supporting myself on savings after I got back from Holland. And I biked every day to the library and come back. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">And one week shortly before I came back to Brown and had a beer at the faculty club with my adviser and said \u201cI want to do this in the end,\u201d I had been reading my pocket Hebrew bible with one side of which was inscribed with my great-grandfather\u2019s name and the other which was inscribed with my father\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">name and I had an experience that set off a four day kind of break where I was just in a fantasy land. But the strange thing was that on I had a lunch with a friend of mine in the middle of it and I had lunch with him and it was normal, I was kind of talking normally and then I got back home and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F3\">was totally back in this kind of fantasy. And I wrote it all down so it was right afterwards, so it was kind of preserved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">But you know, it was like a four day vision or something. And it had a very complex narrative, it involved Adam and Eve, everything else. It was very very strange. Let me put it that way. I don\u2019t know how much detail to give but the problematic for the dissertation in some sense was kind of I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">you know (pause) I preserved the stuff that I had written immediately afterwards and there were certain elements that were preserved in the dissertation -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: That played a role in this kind of fantasy. It ended again by volition It was just like, \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for it to be over.\u201d And I went for a walk and I said goodbye to my father. That\u2019s probably the part that I was describing to you. I just like got up and I went for a walk to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">park and I said (ph) this poem to my father and I went and saw the gorillas and that was the end. So it wasn\u2019t like If it was some kind of break with reality, it was a funny kind of break as if I had sort of prescribed it and I think at the time my understanding of it had partly been, I kind of came <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">back to San Diego to say goodbye to my father and I was having a hard time doing it and this was the device that I had chosen given my peculiar affinity for these kinds of narratives, psycho (ph) dramas. This was the way I had chosen to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562350\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">At any rate, there were certain incites that I had gotten legitimately from reading things and doing library research and that sort of thing that played a role both in this vision, or however you want to think about it, or break and the dissertation itself and I think I had difficulty letting go of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">the biblical frame in which it sort of occurred to me and the implication of that was that I went off on this year long digression that postponed the dissertation until after the research associateship at Brown was over. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">So in other words, some physician had been that I would complete the dissertation before I\u2019d arrived. And I don\u2019t\u2019 think they really cared at some level but for me that was really important that I was kind of not justifying my existence there. It turned out to be much more complex institutionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Alright so, the vision that you had is what took the dissertation in a different direction that then cost you the year?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Kind of, yeah. Like, I wanted to tell it. I wanted it to be a part of this thing that is was writing even though it was obviously inappropriate and none of my advisers knew anything about this kind of just so that we\u2019re not talking so vaguely, the idea was that the institutional features of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">the public health regime in Europe were very significantly impacted consciously at one time and then kind of by force of inertia by the symbolism and kind of institutional framework of Leviticus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: So, you know, like the section that\u2019s supposedly a legal text prescribing certain ways that you deal with what became in the Greek speaking world the leper and were kind of resuscitated (ph) for the European plague regime and then became very important in defining how people from different states <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">in the last 400 years were treated when they went across the border.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: So that was the basic argument but what I had wanted to do -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: This is what came out of the vision or this is what you had been working on before? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Well, you know, this played a role in the vision and this played a role in the dissertation as well and [to untangle them] (ph) is I think a little bit difficult but you know, it was present. This basic contention or incite or what have you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Predated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I was kind of coming to it. It inspired my kind of autodidactic biblical criticism and led to these two what I had hoped were converging trains of thought that it became clear that it was incompatible. In any case, like, I had a way that I wanted to tell this story just, I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">I think that was the point that I was trying to make and it was so hard to vest myself of it partly because it was so deeply personal that I just diverted my life. And in some sense why I needed to write the dissertation to get a PhD in history, you know it also [would pay] (ph), you know, it\u2019s a foundational <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">question as much as anything else but maybe that\u2019s a matter for a separate time. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562350\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">The point is that I have had difficulty in the past or I have had a challenge or it has been characteristic of me in the past that when I feel like I want to say something in a particular way, it\u2019s hard for me to let go of it. And I think what I was reflecting on this week was whether I was doing it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">again. Whether the way that I\u2019ve been handling this conflict with Jennie and the way that I\u2019ve been handling my sense of mission with regards to this project is not without judgment even just a) another example of my tendency to really feel compelled and swept away and captivated by these kinds <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F2\">of expressive projects. The compulsion to express or impulsion to. Does that help? Is that thought clear? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT:  There was a long time when I had a hard time navigating between the sense that this revelation or vision or what have you was like a revelation and the idea that it was some kind of psychopathology. It\u2019s like these two interpretations somehow coexisted at the same time and I would tack between <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">one or the other and I would have aversion to it and I would have an attraction to it and it was very hard to reconcile. (pause) I think at this point I have reconciled them just by saying that I have a very strong (laughs) (inaudible at 00:30:27) and you know, it gets deployed for various reasons, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200932\">sometimes constructively and sometimes unconstructively but (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: (clears throat)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: I mean I I think it\u2019s true to say that you have, what do you call it?

That it implies that I want to communicate something to her, that there is something important to me that she needs to respect. So it\u2019s not so much the content of the writing as the act of writing itself which is more basic <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD2\">step (ph) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Actually I would say it\u2019s very clear that it\u2019s the act of writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: And we don\u2019t know yet.

I said to her \u201cThere are things that I want to communicate to Grayson. There are things in the content that I would like to say to my son. That something you just characteristic, or characteristic <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">of my vision as a human being, that I would like my son, when he\u2019s old enough and you know, Jennie\u2019s dad I can\u2019t remember that I mentioned this at some point Jennie\u2019s dad brought an flash drive that contained audio files of her grandfather telling extemporaneous stories to her and her sister. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E92\">25 different stories that he would tell. And I thought at the time, \u201cWow, what a wonderful legacy that would be to have a story that you not only tell to your child but that\u2019s preserved \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mhm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: \u201cThat when they\u2019re older and have more experience of the world they can go back to and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s who my grandfather was.

That is a part <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">of this compulsion I think, it is. Grayson just plays a part in it. Now, you know, I think I\u2019m, for better or worse, I probably have ambitions of getting it public whatever, I mean, it\u2019s (ph) said in the past it\u2019s not essential but that would probably a) be nice and b) help me with this vocational <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED2\">thing and c) make Jennie respect the process a little bit more.
