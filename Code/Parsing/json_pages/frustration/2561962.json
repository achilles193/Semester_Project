They said, oh I really like this. This is really, really good. I went what? I wrote my friend Rita who has a book deal. She\u2019s writing a book and has written a number of books. I wrote to her and said hey, listen. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">You\u2019re the most successful writer I know, you\u2019ve written tons of stuff. You always like everyone else say you like my work but that simply can\u2019t be true. Like it just can\u2019t be quite that good \u2013 it quite obviously has flaws. And no one\u2019s telling me about them. No one will tell me. She was like \u2013 definitely. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">She was like I can\u2019t get to it right now but I will be sure to get to it. And I thought, awesome. And I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to become of that but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You want some real feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. It\u2019s nice to have support and everything, but \u2013 so that\u2019s why I asked for her help. I just got the invite this morning and I\u2019ve accepted. There on a site called Archive of Our Own. It\u2019s mostly a site for collecting fan fiction and various things. So my thought was (unclear) my Sherlock <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">stuff as an experiment and throw it up there and people could comment on it. And then if I get some actual feedback, people who don\u2019t know me, hidden by the Internet anonymity can tell me what they really think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the anonymity might mean that they can be more aggressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Aggressive, yeah. Meanwhile they can just tell me what they like about it which is great. And there are some lines in there. You know, like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: What do you think of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s pretty good. I think I have a talent for it, clearly. I just don\u2019t think I could write a book at the moment, you know? I just don\u2019t think that I would be \u2013 there is a book published that I wrote. Not that it matters anymore. Read a book on Kindle for $3 and then you\u2019re a published <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">author also. (Unclear) aside. I like writing. I like it a lot and (smacking lips, chewing, cellophane crinkling) like I said, when it stops being easy I stop and then I write something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: When it stops being easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. If I\u2019m not flowing, write something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Do you ever return to it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Or does it \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve got lots to return to. I\u2019ve got one series of take outs I\u2019m doing rewrites for. Because I like it. I like it a lot. I like the characters. Decide to change some aspects of them. Blah, blah, blah. I have this one character. She was a lizard person. And I was like you know, I think I\u2019ll fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">cut lizard people out of this whole thing. I don\u2019t need lizard people cluttering up my mythology.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561962\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: But the thing I really liked, this image I had of a combat scene where (unclear) or something and Cullen\u2019s like right, now I\u2019ve got to go save the lizard. Ezra is making his way across there and when the lizard, there\u2019s this scene where she kind of distends her jaw, comes closer and bites his <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">face, literally bites the front half of his skull off. And the figure is kind of a wizard by magic (unclear) and this is the scene as I see her so it was kind of flighty and not really capable of that level of brutality. I like that. I like characters who suddenly show what they\u2019re capable of. [0:05:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like they have a life of their own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think in the end I\u2019m going to kill the main character. I haven\u2019t had too many characters that I actually love now. I hadn\u2019t intended to have couples as my main characters. But as it turned out, that\u2019s who they are. But I\u2019m not like explicit about that in any way. It\u2019s just what happens, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">just what\u2019s there. There\u2019s a scene where they get in a bad situation where they\u2019re outmatched and they\u2019ll probably both have to be killed. But they actually pull together in the end, you know, by the skin of their teeth. Maggie\u2019s got a really bad concussion and she\u2019s injured and might die. Erin\u2019s trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">to keep her awake. Something\u2019s wrong with her voice the entire time, she keeps fading in and out of consciousness you know. At one point she and Erin just said at one point, \u2018if you let her die, I\u2019ll find you. I swear I\u2019ll find you.\u2019 And this is all because Maggie has this God that does stuff for her <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D3\">sometimes. This God that is (unclear) self-reliance who says, I\u2019m going to give you exactly what you need after you\u2019ve proven to me that you don\u2019t need me. Then I\u2019ll help out. Once I know you don\u2019t need me then I\u2019ll do something. Then I\u2019ll help out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: But I really like the idea of this whole book going on, this whole thing with Maggie dying and her God not saving her and it\u2019s very sad and the last scene then essentially is new people showing up to take the place of Maggie and stuff and (unclear) sees that Erin is going and says like where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">are you going? And it\u2019s ending like on the note of, \u201cI\u2019ve got a god to kill.\u201d Like that\u2019s her story. She\u2019s going to go find that God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Is that the God that kind of didn\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, didn\u2019t help her best friend. Didn\u2019t help her girlfriend so she\u2019s going to go kill it. That would be a nice little thing to throw at the end. I could go some more about it but Erin goes to find a god.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s the way it will end though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. Erin goes to find a god. Yeah, that\u2019ll be fun. I could actually write a short book that would take us in that direction and it\u2019s got a lot of me in that I\u2019ll (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s what people like, people like that. People who like to have lots going on, seem interested. I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. And also, meanwhile, my life has lost all meaning. Like I find that I\u2019ve been employed for so long that I don\u2019t know what I am. You know, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">whole thing is that if you are your job you know you are your job.

Sell my magic cars you know and some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">more stuff that happened. I could sign up for teaching which is a single migration. I would be a really good English as a second language person. I don\u2019t know if they teach that here. That\u2019s an important skill. It\u2019s only polite, when you move into a country to learn the language. It\u2019s hard when you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">move into (unclear) get fired up.

I\u2019ll knock off a little bit here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: (Unintelligible). He was late for the first time ever. He said guess how late I was. I was like \u2013 30 seconds. Because he\u2019s usually very exact. Okay I\u2019ll be there in six minutes. He knows that\u2019s how much time it takes him to put his shoes on and go to work. But he was an hour and 20 minutes late. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">Like, what happened? He was like, I slept through my alarm. I\u2019ve done that. He\u2019s like, the phone rang and it was the supervisor and she was really worried about him. He was like, I slept through the alarm. He showed up, he got to work at 1:20 \u2013 they must have called him when he was an hour late. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200992\">takes him 15 minutes to get to work, five minutes to get dressed \u2013 one hour and 20 minutes. He said when he got there everyone just applauded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: You\u2019re never late in your life and you get one \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: How long has he been there now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: A couple of years now. He really likes it, you know? And they\u2019ve got a good benefits plan. Picture a guy with (unclear). I think he\u2019d be happy to work at Whole Foods for a very long time. Yeah, that\u2019s giving him a sort of second family or perhaps a real family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s gotten to know people there pretty well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. But trying to define who I am and I would like to be a voice actor and a writer and a You Tube contact creator and that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do. Would l like to make games? And I\u2019d love to make games but I need a team to make game. I mean could I do a one man job to make a game? Absolutely. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">Yes. But you need other folks to make that worthwhile. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ll start bringing in some for the income. Like all the miracles that pay. Like the extra Viacom money, you know, that stuff \u2013 it\u2019s all happened. And Ginny\u2019s working her ass off. She\u2019s actually doing the per diem thing for her <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A52\">old job. It\u2019s on Saturday and she does the Hospice stuff though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: A little extra money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Only now she gets fewer bucks. She does weddings and funerals whenever possible and that\u2019s like $400 a pop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019re continuing to look though even though you\u2019re not crazy about it and gaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I said I did that before the holidays and now just getting back from the holidays so I\u2019m not getting anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s quiet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I should be looking. But honestly? Like that\u2019s not even what I want to do but I will do that, I will do that to make money, you know? It doesn\u2019t have to be much. I don\u2019t need a six-figure job. I need something significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561962\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but what you\u2019d rather do is freelance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019d love to write. I love writing. Because it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s just what happens. Now, like I\u2019m writing stuff and I\u2019m looking at Rita\u2019s stuff and like (unclear). Now I see more of why my stuff differs from Rita\u2019s stuff and how it differs from people I like. But really I have a number of different <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">styles. I have a fairytale style I really enjoy. You know people give Central America credit for magical realism but in many ways we actually take a look at the Brothers Grimm for magical realism. It\u2019s all a fairytale but very close to sort of magical realism. Although magical realism is just there <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B52\">are magical things that happen as part of that particular reality, right? Like a man with wings shows up on the beach so they keep him in a cage and the only thing that\u2019s magical is that this man has wings and otherwise is unremarkable as is how to deal with one magical element in the world. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B53\">this one about \u2013 which is fascinating. It\u2019s this horror novel written in the second person so it\u2019s a \u2018you do this, you do this\u2019. So it\u2019s interesting. In any case what is (unintelligible) I guess. One or two but it doesn\u2019t really matter. I have this (unclear) spot I like to write in which is more flowery <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B54\">and whimsical and is much closer to what Neil Gaiman writes. [0:21:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">But writing the Sherlock stuff is a very different style. Writing the Maggie and Erin was a very different style. Maggie and Erin is a lot more action packed but also much more about the emotional connection between these two than the journey of Maggie from this tough, emotionally shut off, passionate <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">hero into this more \u2013 someone who realizes it\u2019s okay to accept help from specific people and Erin who is much more in touch with her emotions. It\u2019s part of what her position in society is. (Unclear) is various people. The (unclear) people are distinguished by various classifications and Maggie is classified <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B72\">as a champion, usually a champion of some cause or a god that gives them power, that makes them so good. The problem with Maggie is nobody knows who her God is, nor does she. She knows it\u2019s female and it does stuff. She knows when she first met it but she doesn\u2019t know anything else about it. And nobody <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B73\">does so it\u2019s kind of fucked up. But with Erin I had to do a lot of acrobatic stuff \u2013 throwing knives and cool stuff and I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with her for a while. I wanted to call her a Ninja but you can\u2019t call someone a Ninja, you know. So I called her a heart-seeker instead and sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B74\">of making it all about heartbeats and frequency of heartbeats and sensing other people\u2019s heartbeats and you know and in tuning the metal in blades to that of the heart so that the blades would actually seek out the heart of a person. (Unclear) could also learn cool things of the heart. But it also gives <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B75\">us a way to get more of a sense of what\u2019s going on in Maggie\u2019s mind from Erin\u2019s perspective. What I\u2019m trying to do with all three of these is show that they each perceive the world in a different way and call them other things that they notice look different. And it is also lighthearted like the funny <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B76\">parts are fine, the fighting parts are violent, graphic, well-choreographed I think, and the feeling parts are feeling, I think. So far everyone likes it, everyone wants more like they ask me to write more stuff. So that\u2019s good, I\u2019ll write more stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561962\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I guess one thing is do you feel like you really would like to make a kind of a go at writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: I\u2019d love to. Like writing a book deal at this point \u2013 you know, make that viable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Well, I think, too, but there\u2019s a lot of people that do try to make a career out of writing creatively and there are probably a lot of ways to go about it but there are people who do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Well I know, right? I\u2019ve got one who is doing that right now. I mean she\u2019s been a lawyer for many years. She teaches law right now but she\u2019s also got a book deal so she\u2019s writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Did she ever freelance? Does she submit stuff to \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: She had until she got an agent. She got an agent and the agent got her a book deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: And then that\u2019s all she writes is what she \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: She writes young adult fiction. She\u2019s written a lot of fan fiction and she still writes it for fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: For fun, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: She\u2019s prolific in terms of her writing but she can \u2013 she writes a (unclear) that\u2019s easy so she can do it for longer. She can write just all day and just some amazing stuff. And like I said, she\u2019s written a trilogy already. She\u2019s already written three novels. These are not the ones being published. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">She\u2019s writing a new trilogy now for a new book deal. That\u2019s what I want to write, too, is young adult stuff, right? Young adult stuff is fun, it gets turned into movies and TV shows and I know it\u2019s more playful. You get to play around and stuff. You get to be funny and feel-y and fight-y. [0:27:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think there\u2019s probably \u2013 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a whole kind of way of people going about doing that. A structure people kind of write and submit stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Well there\u2019s a magazine a friend of mine suggested I submit a short story to. They give out cash prizes that go up to $1,000 for stories they take. When I (unclear), when I flesh out these three chapters I have and two like a short story, they pull together like a short story, I can submit that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">They assure you on the side, this is our form rejection letter, this is what you\u2019ll get if we don\u2019t take your piece. Don\u2019t be offended that it\u2019s a form but we get so many submissions, there are only two of us and we\u2019re sisters and we run this magazine. The general form rejection letter is very good. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF2\">Like here\u2019s some writer\u2019s tips, things to think about. Like (unintelligible) as a result of these actions. I\u2019m just like fuck. I\u2019ve still never written a sex scene. I was supposed to write a sex scene in creative writing in college, a class which I fought my way through. The teacher and I just fought <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF3\">and fought and fought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: She was the professor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. We would always fight because she would make us read these depressing, awful things. And I just wanted to write something that was funny. And she had us write these exercises of like the saddest things. And I\u2019d think this is fine and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And just write like whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">and she\u2019d have us read stuff and she fucking like whatever. And one time she asked us to write a sex scene and so I kind of wrote like looking at a post saying like typical college virgin thing like post first time awkwardness and in one part she was \u201cugh\u201d and I\u2019m like, I know it\u2019s not very good but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D32\">I don\u2019t write sex scenes. And Jim Butcher had written some sex scenes and mostly women write sex scenes but J.K. Dennison is this black (unclear) because she\u2019s trying to make a name for herself in a mostly male community of science fiction writers and she writes these books that are amazing from perspectives <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D33\">of people I\u2019ve never considered. She writes the first book as a black woman whereas in that world black people are not oppressed but they are seen as other in a culture which is (unclear). So there\u2019s that aspect. [0:31:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561962\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">But she writes sex scenes from the perspective of a woman and it\u2019s absolutely eye-opening. Amazing stuff. A lot of times she talks about the quality of surrender. It is so interesting. It\u2019s equated with sex, the surrender. I guess for me. From what I gather, this J.K. Dennison really likes men taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">a more dominant role in a sex relationship. This is what I gather from her writing about sex. And then she wrote about sex so many times in those books, a common theme from all of them was the idea of surrender and surrendering to control, essentially. But the books were also incredibly good. The second <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D52\">book is written from the perspective of the woman who has no vision. She can only see matter of the gods in a world littered with gods and godlings. And so there she has some amount of perception into the world of God matters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll write my own stuff and won\u2019t have anything to do with (unclear) stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re kind of like well how do I differentiate myself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like how to fucking write a book? You know? How do I do it like this week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) That\u2019s a tall order.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: It is a tall order. You know fucking [Nan Oremo] (ph)? You\u2019ve heard of [Nan Oremo] (ph)? It\u2019s a November \u2013 it\u2019s like a challenge you write in a book in November. You write a 50,000 page novella, essentially. You don\u2019t edit. You don\u2019t stop. You just write X amount of words a day and boom, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">you have a book. Boy is this book shitty. Can it be salvaged? Victor wrote one years ago. He\u2019s been trying to get us to read it for some time, but it\u2019s fucking awful, like it\u2019s really bad. And I\u2019m having a hard time telling him, like man, this is your first attempt at a novel. Just fucking toss it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">right? Like that? That\u2019s what writers do, right? They take a bunch of stuff, they write a bunch of stuff and they fucking toss it, you know? [0:33:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right, right.

Everything before was bullshit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s a kind of a very, well, it\u2019s really creative. There\u2019s also the side of the \u2013 there\u2019s a whole discipline to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s an art, right? It\u2019s a skill set. A talent and a skill set. And I have the talent and I\u2019m working on the skill set. I\u2019ve worked on the skill set for years. Like I said, I took creative writing and I\u2019ve taken writing courses. I accidently had to take Writing II in college. It was such a joke. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">I told you about the professor in that one, right? He came into class. He didn\u2019t want to teach Writing II.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: But he had to because it was his turn that semester and he didn\u2019t want to do it but he taught like at the 400 level English classes about like real books. And so he walks in the first day and he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to teach this class so I\u2019m not going to.\u2019 He was like, \u2018how many here feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">like you need help with your writing? Honestly.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Fine. You can still be ready (unclear) because I\u2019m not going to teach you a goddamn thing.\u2019 (Laughing) He\u2019s like, \u2018this class is stupid.\u2019 Alright, like, nobody here needs this class.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561962\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: So what did you make of the class?

And was like, I have only three rules in this class: 1 \u2013 lie. If you can pull the wool over my eyes, more power to you. 2 \u2013 Cheat. People say cheaters never win. This is not true. Cheaters always win. That\u2019s why they cheat. 3 \u2013 Never underestimate <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">the value of money. For $50 we never have to see each other again \u2013 and everyone laughs. But then as I may have mentioned I\u2019ve noted over the years that his birthday fell so conveniently at the end of both semesters during grading time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: His birthday, twice a year, right when grades were due. He liked whiskey. He wanted people to know he wanted presents. And people would and he would give them \u201cA\u201ds. Whatever. He was like, oh [] showed up in my office with a bottle of whiskey for my birthday. That\u2019s great. You ladies are great <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">students I think you\u2019re both getting an A this semester. Oh really! You\u2019re goddamn right. Thank you for the whiskey. He was completely corrupt and I loved that about him. Because he understood the joke. He got the joke. He\u2019s like, this is this whole thing, this whole structure is useless. This is all <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F52\">a game that people are playing, paying money for education that they will never be able to get back.

That was the only one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: That was it. I slacked because it was supposed to be a throw-away course but this semester junior teachers had it and they were like oh, it\u2019s going to be a real course this year.

And the God particle is an awful name for it, an awful name <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201211\">for it. It\u2019s just totally American to call it that. Only in America do we have such idiocy as that. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re an idiot, but I\u2019m saying that the term is idiotic. It is not a god particle. It is not proof of God.
