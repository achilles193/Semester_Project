So that was \u2013 that\u2019s nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a relief. It\u2019s kind of making more sense to me now. Three hours a day to work is going to be a challenge especially when my mother leaves, but I think by the time she goes I\u2019ll have made a good start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: How long is she here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: She\u2019s here until the 15th. And then my mother-in-law will come down as soon as her \u2013 she had a rotator cuff surgery so when that is more or less healed, she\u2019ll come down, so that\u2019s probably three weeks that we won\u2019t have coverage. It\u2019s not optimal, but we\u2019ll make it work. And then after April <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">1, Jennie\u2019s parents are coming. I think the plan is that they\u2019ll come through the end of the school year. So we\u2019ll have some opportunity I think, at least (unclear) to write these things. I don\u2019t know if it will be enough. And it always feels good pushing against the door and the door opens. It\u2019s a relief.

I think I said, \u2018it\u2019s just very hard to be stuck.\u2019 I remember being unusually irritated at the end <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">of the 45 minutes. So other than that I can\u2019t remember anything that came before that. I said something to you and I think that was the last thing I said to you was it\u2019s really not very much fun to be stuck like this. It\u2019s funny that you don\u2019t remember it.

I\u2019m not saying dealing with that isn\u2019t in a way, the process that we\u2019re dealing with, but I think it poses some (unclear) of hardship <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">to what you find with your work. [0:08:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause): [0:08:44 \u2013 0:09:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(Pause): [0:09:14 \u2013 0:09:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: And your sense is that we\u2019re not talking enough about an organic memory deficit, we\u2019re talking about some repressed impression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And one thing that makes that strikingly clear today is that on Tuesday you absolutely could not remember Friday. And today you can remember Friday but not Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(Pause): [0:09:44 \u2013 0:09:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: And we have a sense that it\u2019s related to connectedness and attachment or something but not, that there\u2019s something that we don\u2019t understand about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">(Pause): [0:10:05 \u2013 0:10:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And I guess the follow on is \u2013 so for two and a half years we\u2019ve been dealing with this, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: And over the course of this time we\u2019ve become more and more sophisticated and articulate in understanding how it happens and where it comes from but it\u2019s still happening. So in theory the next step would be to make its (unclear) up since it is a real problem. I mean it\u2019s a real genuine difficulty. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s still operative. I mean even if the kind of the \u2013 I don\u2019t think therapeutic model, but the sense of the model trajectory is that in talking about these things and hashing through it and figuring them out and interacting about them, you know, slowly, organically, they begin <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F2\">to dissolve. In theory, we should have begun to make some progress and yet this tendency toward repressing memories of something, I have no recollection of what might be the cause of my repressing, if that\u2019s the right jargon we\u2019re using here \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562004\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: My memory of our discussion on Tuesday, but why should I still be doing it? And if we understand why that may might be the case, then by all means then for the sake of making this process more effective, we ought to intervene. I\u2019m being a little provocative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well. Maybe a little. I mean, but also I think you\u2019re really frustrated because when you can\u2019t remember like this, I think you really feel quite disconnected from the work we\u2019ve done on it. You sort of know abstractly that it\u2019s out there but there\u2019s the \u2013 but in the moment you feel, I think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">pretty helpless and frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just feel, I mean, frustrated, helpless, sure. I\u2019m not denying it. But more specifically, I feel sick of it. You know? It feels like Groundhog Day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: What tends to happen here is that I say something like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(Pause): [0:13:47 \u2013 0:14:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And actually what is the same is that you come back to this place where you know the fact I don\u2019t remember and every time you feel like we haven\u2019t really done anything with this, which is actually not something you feel at other times but you don\u2019t remember that either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I feel, at other times I feel as if \u2013 as I do now as I said a moment ago \u2013 our analysis has gotten progressively more specific and more, I think, fine-tuned, and I appreciate that that is important and takes a lot of work. I have no impulse to deny that so no, I disagree. So what I do feel is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">that it\u2019s still happening and that\u2019s kind of undeniable. It\u2019s still happening, the principle, kind of proximal cause of many of the things that are most difficult and disruptive for me I think we\u2019re agreed on this disconnectedness which manifests itself frequently as a kind of lost memory function and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">here it is, still there. Like not only there to be seen by us in our interaction but actually interfering with our capacity to work well to counteract this. So it\u2019s not remembering that we do work. I don\u2019t feel disconnected from our accomplishments as a dyad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: But I think you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Actually, I think you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: And here\u2019s why I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Okay. Lay it on me, brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) Okay. Because, for example, on Tuesday by the end of the hour I think you remembered quite a bit from Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. I remember remembering it. That\u2019s the only thing that I remember about Tuesday is that I remembered Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right. And so within the span of the 45 minutes that we met you remembered and kind of got back in touch with where we were at and how we had been thinking together about things with the idea that I would say, with me and that clearly is not where you want to be at the end of the day but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">it\u2019s quite a different place from where you were both in terms of the content which is more where you\u2019re pointing to of how we\u2019re understanding things, but I would also add with the sort of, in a way, the severity of the symptom. You know, it\u2019s not just that you forget, it\u2019s like how thick is the repression? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">How long does it take to reconnect with what\u2019s lost? How much work does it take? How much sort of charge and emotion is there to it? And you know, you\u2019re pretty much back there within the 45 minutes and without a whole lot of heavy lifting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562004\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: What would heavy lifting be? Like crying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: You know, like getting to something that feels sort of rare and hard to get to, things like that, you know. Like I mean I bet if \u2013 and in a way this is what we did on Tuesday, I think in part, we sort of jogged each other\u2019s memory about Friday. Probably, me \u2013 I think what happened is you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">came in with no idea about what happened on Friday. We talked a little more. I said something like, maybe that reminds me of Friday and I elaborated a little more about what went on on Friday. That helped you. You could say that helped put you more in touch with it, but I think more directly and I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200612\">I said this at the time, I said, I think actually there\u2019s something about my doing that that makes you feel like I\u2019m kind of here, I was there then, I\u2019m kind of \u2013 it like helps you have more confidence in me, or makes you feel more connected to me and that I think then contributes to kind of bringing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200613\">you around in a way. By then I think you remember more clearly, you sort of get back into where we were and so forth. For example, I think at the end, my recollection was \u2013 about your comment about being stuck and being really frustrated about it \u2013 that that was half of it. That we actually identified <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200614\">more about where the stuck feeling came from in terms, I think, of like Friday \u2013 I may be confused \u2013 was it Tuesday we were talking about infidelity?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I think \u2013 no, it must have Tuesday because my mother had this dream, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right. And how in different times you find yourself in different roles there. And sometimes in the role of kind of your vulnerable mother who was being betrayed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: And at other times as a kind of self-interested \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I think that was Friday. I think that was the moment where you said, oh, you were kind of ahead of me. I remember. It doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: That could be. Your mother \u2013 I think you\u2019re right though about your mother\u2019s dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I think we had this conversation about my taking on both roles on Friday when we had the conversation about infidelity. I guess in that general context on Tuesday. It doesn\u2019t matter though, you\u2019re right. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(Pause): [0:20:21 \u2013 0:20:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: One question I have though \u2013 it sounds like actually you do remember some stuff from Tuesday, you sort of put it into Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: No. You didn\u2019t remember the stuff about affairs, infidelity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t remember that.

[0:23:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Well, I just, whatever. We\u2019re talking in metaphors necessarily and that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really that important to differentiate between the metaphor of the wound and the metaphor of scar tissue or something. But I think to the extent that it is meaningful, what is likely to be frustrating <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">to me on Tuesday, and you\u2019re right \u2013 to the extent that I can recall now, I agree with your narrative, your synopsis, here. To the extent that it\u2019s frustrating that this is what was frustrating, it\u2019s more that they still organize things. In fact, they still organize my thoughts. They still organize <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200952\">my mother\u2019s dreams. They still organize \u2013 it\u2019s not like there\u2019s some damage that they\u2019ve caused that\u2019s still open. It\u2019s healed over. The problem is that we\u2019re all walking with a limp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: The reason, the thing that \u2013 I thought I remembered you saying with a word expressing the frustration, is how, I mean, when we got to \u2013 I think I said something like \u2013 \u2018this is what happens with your work.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s certainly true. There\u2019s no question about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And you said, \u2018yeah.\u2019 And I guess in that sense it would seem to me that it hasn\u2019t healed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: It hasn\u2019t healed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Okay. So you may be able to articulate better how it applies to your work but what I have in mind is something like a conflict for you in getting to work both because you felt like what you were doing in some way wasn\u2019t for the family, it was just for you, so it was leaving, or betrayal. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">And then at other times, the feeling on the other end of it like Jennie was focused on her stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You could feel betrayed and upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And I don\u2019t remember how that fed back into your work. I guess it was more than the first one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: I see, so this betrayal has made me acutely sensitive to the possibility of betrayal meaning that the wound is still open, is still sensitive. I see. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. I think there\u2019s true to that. I think that \u2013 and I see what you\u2019re saying now about that implying a kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">of distillation of my mother\u2019s viewpoint in the matter since she was principally the one who was \u2013 at least most proximally the one who was betrayed. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562004\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Although \u2013 and I think this is another thing that we \u2013 I said on Tuesday is that\u2019s complicated because there were also moments at which he treated you that way, too. Not just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Oh. Yeah. I mean, you know, my dad (heavy sigh). You know what\u2019s a shame, Marshall? What\u2019s shitty is that my dad was a great guy. What\u2019s shitty is that my dad was a great guy and I \u2013 he was a really creative, loving person and he was just so fucked up in these ways that I don\u2019t have any contact <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">with that feeling anymore. When I remember my father, what I think of is a user \u2013 you know, somebody who just made the wrong choices, who was delusive and grandiose and really fucked his family in a serious way. You know, left an incredible mess to deal with. I just don\u2019t have any touch with it. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">weirdly when I realize this and try and get in touch with the things that were wonderful about my dad I can\u2019t think of \u2013 it\u2019s not the interactions between me and him that I think of because those feel tainted, it\u2019s the interactions between me and my sis \u2013 in between him and my sister whose relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD3\">I think was much more complicated. I\u2019m just so \u2013 my memories of him are just so tainted by you know, both first hand and probably a referred sense of betrayal that I can\u2019t remember him without uncomplicated affection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">(Pause): [0:29:04 \u2013 0:29:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: And yet, bizarrely, as some level my professional failures, I somehow think of them as the other side of the coin. I see his professional failures. In other words, they\u2019re not even my own failures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Like he kind of carries them for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s the analog or flip side of this phenomenon we noticed of me feeling betrayed through my mother\u2019s eyes. I feel my failures through my father\u2019s eyes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">(Pause): [0:29:50 \u2013 0:30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m enlisted in both of their something. You know, both of them used me in their particular kind of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: It did seem a couple of minutes ago when you said, \u2018Look, you know the thing is, Marshall, my father\u2019s a great guy,\u2019 that there was a \u2013 in remembering him that way or in explaining that to me, like to me there was a flicker of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I\u2019m aware of it but I\u2019m not in touch with it at this point. At least at this moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: I know this to be true. I know that people loved him but for very specific reasons. I know that he was lovable. But I don\u2019t, for years now I have just not been able to access them. But I know, it\u2019s like the most contact I have with him as something other than an object lesson, is in my sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">of judgment about my own failure to succeed. It feels like just a continuation of his.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Well, as you know, I tend to think of these sorts of things that get played out in the transference between you and me and I have a specific idea of how this one does. Yeah, I had been thinking before you said this about him, which is in keeping with what you were saying, kind of a revelation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">for me. I mean it\u2019s not that I thought he was all bad but I\u2019ve never heard you speak about him that way before. So it really struck me. But my point is, before even you said that \u2013 I had this thought like, okay, so Aaron and I are doing that thing that we do when he doesn\u2019t remember and he\u2019s frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C32\">and feels like in a way the most important thing isn\u2019t happening here. And what happens is like I kind of help him remember, I talk about what happened, I put this in like a broader context. And the feeling that I had that I didn\u2019t know what to do with feels to me a little like I kind of have to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C33\">nice and show that I\u2019m being supportive and I\u2019m here and I remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562004\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: When you would prefer to be mean and cruel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) Of course! (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Traumatizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Well, you know. Gotta have a goal. But the feeling in a way is like I\u2019m kind of half intentionally showing, like demonstrating, that I am going to be nice and helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And what came to my mind as you were talking about your father and really what you\u2019re talking about are these two kind of split or just two versions of him really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: No. I mean, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I guess the way that I mean that is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: That implies I think a more barouche psychodynamic is necessary. You know, some kind of split in my memory of my father. I think a less complicated way of saying it, a less kind of symbolizing way of saying it is, you know, I\u2019m just angry and feel betrayed and kind of fucked over and in those <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">circumstances it\u2019s hard to get in touch with the good things, which doesn\u2019t have to be two completely different models and memories of (unclear). [0:34:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Right? The difference there seems to be \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019m willing to go with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Okay. Fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Where I was going or will go with that though is to say that, yeah, I feel like there is an echo of that in our interactions around your forgetting where you express some frustration and maybe a little provocation and I show that I\u2019m sensitive to it and nice and I\u2019m going to help and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">you sort of warm up a little bit and remember and kind of get back into things. Am I clear the way I mean like it\u2019s an echo of it because it\u2019s like you come in frustrated and really saying that this hasn\u2019t helped you with the most important thing you wanted help with in the way you wanted help with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">it. And I think that it\u2019s certainly in parallel in the kind of anger and disappointment you have towards him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Okay. Finish the thought. I don\u2019t want to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: And then you know, once I respond in a way that sort of demonstrates in a sense that I am here to help with whatever you are right in the moment expressing frustration about which is remembering. You don\u2019t have to be angry and we can be like more partners in this rather than sort of opposite <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">sides or different sides of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: So there are two things \u2013 two propositions you have here. One of them is to reframe the frustration as a kind of interpersonal frustration rather than frustration with a phenomenon or some kind of psychic event like forgetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: In other words, my forgetting is not forgetting per se. It\u2019s something do to with the two of us. And number two is to identify what that interference between our interaction as the product of some kind of transference in which you\u2019re standing in for my frustration and anger and sense of betrayal <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">from my father to give me what I need.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562004\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Well, that sounds like a very shrink thing to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Both of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I could really (unclear) about the last.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">(Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Okay.

When has your forgetting or your coming back with something ever not had to do with your feeling betrayed by somebody? Ever. I mean, in work \u2013 all the time. At home with Jennie. I mean this is what we\u2019ve been talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">about the last two sessions. You don\u2019t get frustrated when you\u2019re working someplace with forgetting. You get \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: (Still laughing) That\u2019s my (unclear). Now, explain transference.

The first one was about my dad\u2019s age, the second one was about my mom\u2019s age when all of this was going on in the late \u201870s, early \u201880s and the third is you and for, I don\u2019t know, the purposes of amusement at the very least, I kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">identified the first one as the dad-shrink, the second one as the mom-shrink and the third is the me-shrink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: I have no idea whether that\u2019s anything more than entertaining but it is very difficult for me to (Pause) \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to get my head around that particular substitution. For the reason that you just pointed out that it recrudesces in every relationship that I have, I think there is a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">useful opportunity for transference because it\u2019s kind of secondhand or like it\u2019s analogical. It\u2019s not \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t feel to you like your father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: No. Not in any sense. And I have no idea whether that\u2019s important, whether it\u2019s worth dwelling on, whether it matters. Maybe it\u2019s completely irrelevant but in no way, shape or form do you feel like my father and I think one of the reasons that our you know, I feel whatever I may be frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">with, I feel very good at the kind of rapport we\u2019ve been able to establish and one reason for that is I feel kind of a connection to and a kind of empathy for you on a kind of peer\/collegial level. So I don\u2019t know how that interacts with the second proposition that you made and maybe it\u2019s better that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F2\">way. Maybe that\u2019s a better, kind of more therapeutically useful kind of formulation of transference. But that\u2019s kind of how I imagine the transference between you and my interject rather than between you and my father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yep, that\u2019s right.

That the reason why these things keep recrudescing in all these different settings is that \u2013 and I guess and it\u2019s not just my dad. I feel a \u2013 I also feel a sense of betrayal and anger and you know it\u2019s different with <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">my mother. You know, there are all of these primary relationships that I feel rightly or wrongly \u2013 I feel some of it is just like a four-year old\u2019s peak that never got processed developmentally, but I feel as if I didn\u2019t get what I needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: And somehow in all of these relationships that\u2019s recrudescing and causing this blockage which manifests itself partly as a blockage of memory.
