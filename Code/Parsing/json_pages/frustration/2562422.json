AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">CLIENT: I guess [pause] I guess I\u2019ve just kind of been thinking about again, yes, kind of what I can do to make things kind of easier, kind of not as, or cover what I should do about this everyday kind of feeling of being tired and not really wanting to be engaged or be I guess more specifically I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">guess kind of just what I should do because it always feels like I\u2019m pushing myself or making some kind of, making myself anxious thinking I have to do this or I should be doing this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">So I guess I was just thinking of what I could do to make it feel like, yes, less of a fight or kind of wanting to do these things [pause] or not kind of going into highly emotive, just doing a bunch of things and not really seeing too much outside of what I\u2019m doing or wanting to be bothered, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And I guess I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What you\u2019re talking about is sort of questioning and thinking about what to do about it rather than more like succumbing to it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Right. [Pause] So the things I could think of that would help or, I don\u2019t know, but they\u2019re very vague and broad. Just kind of sift like how things are when I\u2019m tired or that I don\u2019t like something instead of always fighting it or I don\u2019t know trusting myself more or being more grateful or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">But I don\u2019t know. [Pause] It seems like any of it kind of figure out what I want and stick to it or I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What you want in terms of plans?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. But I don\u2019t know [pause] it seems doubtful because I\u2019m sidetracked or it\u2019s always tough [pause] or I\u2019m easily persuaded else-wise (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Well I imagine that there are things that would potentially make you anxious about the things you mentioned trying. I guess something yields a kind of passivity that would go along with accepting for example being tired rather than and [inaudible at 00:10:57] said or worried that in trusting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">yourself you\u2019d be making some kind of mistake or that you had it wrong. [Pause] I\u2019m not saying not to do it; I\u2019m just saying that might relate to the kind of dynamics [around it] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I\u2019m extremely skeptical but I feel like I need to do something. I need to, I don\u2019t know, yes kind of get outside my comfort zone or push or something like that. But [pause] yes, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know what to do or even how to kind of view the problem in terms of I just need to change <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">my perspective or do I need to change, I don\u2019t know, something I\u2019m doing or not doing? I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Well I actually it seems possible that it\u2019s actually a pretty interesting moment. It seems to me that you are questioning the way you\u2019ve been going about things and you\u2019re a little bit you\u2019re questioning the paradigm in a way that I think you kind of haven\u2019t quite before. I mean you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">been frustrated with it, you\u2019ve wanted to get rid of it but I guess it seems to me like your angle on it is a bit different now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">And yet I think I think you\u2019re also feeling perhaps very anxious for not having a new one. And the new one would sort of further help you to dismantle the old one. I do think partly you\u2019re looking to me for that. There\u2019s a sort of what sounds to me I think like a kind of a pitch of anxiety that you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">feeling where you\u2019re wanting from me some suggestions about how to work against the way things have been working that\u2019s been so difficult. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562422\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">And I think that\u2019s a very anxious, that\u2019s a scary thing to do. So this is the way I\u2019ve been doing things, I can feel a little more how it\u2019s not working, I\u2019m trying to think of ways to kind of struggle against it or resist it or handle things in a different way but I don\u2019t have one yet. And it makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">me think of [pause] an analogy that\u2019s about as usual (ph) for me like a hermit crab between shells kind of or something like that. Between them but maybe can\u2019t get out from under one and wondering where the next one\u2019s going to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Maybe. [Pause] I mean [pause] I guess I need, I don\u2019t know, the shell analogy makes it sound like I shouldn\u2019t [just connect] (ph) with another shield or kind of illusion. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of defy or something. And I still feel like I still don\u2019t really understand what the problem is or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">what I need. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I guess how I\u2019m thinking about it is if the way you do things now is a shield, what it\u2019s protecting you from I think is this sense of disappointment that you were referring to yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">The point of staying very focused, of not getting pulled off at times you\u2019re always your prerogative is to kind of protect yourself from being disappointed in yourself or in other people I think. And I think you\u2019re saying okay, that way\u2019s not making me very happy; I don\u2019t want to do it that way. What <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">if I just say when I\u2019m tired, okay I\u2019m tired. I can\u2019t do twelve things to try to ward off this feeling of disappointment I\u2019m just going to accept that I\u2019m tired. I mean that\u2019s one example if I understand you correctly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">And I guess I can see how that would be scary because it sort of exposes, it leaves you much more exposed. You\u2019re right; I think the crab analogy falls down that way. I mean I don\u2019t think you\u2019re looking for some other way to protect yourself. You\u2019re I think looking to not be feeling so vulnerable in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">the first place if that makes sense; to deal with whatever this feeling of disappointment is so it doesn\u2019t affect you so much and you\u2019re kind of freer to do things the way you want and in the first place to know what you want, if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">So I think your point about my metaphor is a very valid one that it doesn\u2019t fit that well in the way you point to. And I guess I\u2019m a little less clear what you mean when you refer to still not really understanding what the problem is. Do you mean why you\u2019re, why you can feel so disappointed in the first <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">place? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I see. [Pause] I basically agree with that, that I don\u2019t yet understand either why that is or how that works. In other words what motivates it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I think there can this other word that sort of can be learned and addressed about it but I don\u2019t know either yet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: So I guess I just get, I don\u2019t know, kind of angry because I don\u2019t know what to do other than what I\u2019ve been doing and it just feels helpless even though I\u2019m kind of willing to try or willing to see things apparently [inaudible] around. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562422\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I actually think you are doing something quite significant, perhaps you\u2019ll see this differently, in it seems to me sort of investigating, questioning and criticizing this sort of paradigm that you\u2019ve been living with and that dictates a lot about how you are living your life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">I think too, I mean it sounds like when I put it like that as though I could be referring to a pretty conceptual or intellectual exercise. But I actually don\u2019t really see it that way in that at least to me it seems in order to really look at that and question and criticize it, it makes you very anxious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like standing up to something terrifying I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. But I guess where I am now is kind of feels like okay I\u2019m going to quit eating sugar but I\u2019m going to still have ice cream. And the ice cream is kind of like I still want to be productive, I still want, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still kind of holding onto it or something. It\u2019s still kind of there, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. Yes, I [pause] I [inaudible at 00:30:05] see it that way too, that it\u2019s still there in a very big way. This is not like something you overthrow in a short period of time. I mean it\u2019s certainly not the way this certain thing works. [Pause] But I do think that what you have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">doing and are doing is kind of making inroads. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">But I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m missing some of the specificity in what you\u2019re saying. When you say you\u2019re going to quit eating ice cream or quit eating sugar, sorry, but still could eat ice cream, what in that analogy is still eating ice cream? Is it trying to figure out something to do about this? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: No, I guess it\u2019s kind of wanting to be productive or all these things are steamrolled or to have it separated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see, okay. And so it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Otherwise it seems like it\u2019s going to I don\u2019t know. Yes, I\u2019ll just do nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right. Yes, I think, okay. I think the very kind of incremental and basically the way that we\u2019re dealing with this which is very incremental and kind of non-linear in the sense that it\u2019s not well you do this and do this and do this and that helps. You know what I mean? It feels very roundabout <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">I think and passive in that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">I think all that brings up that same, well I think it\u2019s very disappointing. And that seems at this moment a lot of what you\u2019re feeling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I feel like I need something, I don\u2019t know, to remind, to not kind of fall back in or kind of remind myself I don\u2019t even know what, [laughs] just remind myself that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I see. That there could be another way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I wonder, I don\u2019t think this is all of what you\u2019re talking about by any means, but I wonder if there\u2019s a piece of that that\u2019s coming up because it\u2019s a Thursday and we\u2019re not going to talk again until Monday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And so I don\u2019t think it always feels this way. Recently it has been, there were moments I think where it\u2019s felt like I am with you contending against this thing. And it\u2019ll be on your list for a few days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Right. I mean it\u2019s just easier to kind of be I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like get lost or kind of slipped away or backsliding, whatever. When I don\u2019t, yes, come here it just kind of, it\u2019s like I\u2019m thrown back in or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562422\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">I don\u2019t know.
