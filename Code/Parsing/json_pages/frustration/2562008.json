I don\u2019t know where to go from here today. Jennie\u2019s mom and stepfather were in town last night and we didn\u2019t put them up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">(Pause): [0:01:42 0:01:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Usually we do a deep cleaning before they show up and this time we didn\u2019t and it was pretty grubby. I felt a bit bad about that because my room was probably the worst. It was fine. So I spent this afternoon cleaning. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I feel sort of becalmed, I guess is the best way <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">to describe what I\u2019ve been talking about for the last weeks. I\u2019m not sure which way the winds are blowing. You know, it\u2019s one of those situations where yet, again, I\u2019m not sure how much good this is doing me if yet again it feels like it\u2019s been a long time in coming. I feel like if there\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">be some kind of good outcome, no better time than the present I guess. We\u2019ve been through this before. On the one hand it\u2019s very familiar and usually has some meaning within the framework of my psychic universe or our interaction or broader network interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">On the other hand, I\u2019m kind of tired of it. At some point I feel like alright, well arriving at the same place at some point like if the bus doesn\u2019t come, you\u2019re going to start walking or calling the dispatch and finding out if maybe there\u2019s one coming along. So I suppose that\u2019s making me a little reticent <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to dive too deeply into whatever it is that I might dive into. I\u2019m feeling in touch with some frustration about what feels at the moment like a lack of productivity and also frustration with the difficulty with objective measures with all of this. How would I know if it was better? What would the outcomes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">measure? Is there some way of telling whether all of this has been useful. And you\u2019ve mentioned, apparently, things that have been improved, but on the other hand they seem to oscillate back and forth quite a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So I guess I\u2019m a bit frustrated with both a sense of really being stuck in much the same way and difficulty with the \u2013 I\u2019m looking for a way to avoid using something about measurement \u2013 it\u2019s not really about measurement \u2013 but some indicator of improvement in whatever it is we\u2019re talking about. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">troubled by the lack of any firm indicator that is stable. It feels like there is a lot of instability in the system. So even when we say, \u2018oh, okay, this is better,\u2019 \u2013 two months later it\u2019s not better and I\u2019m still having trouble. So as I\u2019m saying, there are many things that we could talk about but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">that probably encapsulates best what I\u2019m feeling right t and I suppose puts the two missed sessions in a different light. Or in a more complex light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(Pause): [0:07:20 0:07:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: For whatever it\u2019s worth \u2013 Jennie is really fed up. I mean she\u2019s very supportive. She\u2019s like \u2013 what the fuck are you doing? You know. And some of that is just her feeling a little bit overwhelmed and she\u2019s like, well, two days a week and you\u2019re already knowing what\u2019s the outcome doesn\u2019t feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">better to me in those moments when she\u2019s very stressed out. Nothing feels better. So you know, I say that with a grain of salt. I don\u2019t often articulate this when she did, so I guess that\u2019s what\u2019s resonating in my mind is a kind of catalyst of this malaise or uncertainty or frustration or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562008\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">(Pause): [0:08:38 0:011:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: I was thinking, it\u2019s the therapist who\u2019s supposed to fall asleep in the chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) I had to (unclear) when first you sat down and closed your eyes I was thinking, gosh, that\u2019s probably the first chance he\u2019s had to close his eyes and sit quietly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: That would be the most therapeutic approach of all, wouldn\u2019t it? For six months or so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">(Both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">(Pause): [0:11:39 0:13:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m starting to get a hold of something, but give me a minute here because I\u2019m in the middle of thinking it through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Should I give you a minute of silence or shall I fill the idle space with patter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: If you have something to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I do. I was just thinking as you were thinking, you know I came to you for help with a professional difficulty \u2013 a severe one. And the outcome has been that I am basically almost de-professionalized at this point and you know, that might be the solution. If it\u2019s not the solution <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">or if it\u2019s not where I would hope to be going with it, then we really have not done very well. But if it is the right direction to go in, you know, if that is really what I wanted and what I have wanted and have had for reasons that I\u2019m sure we would not have to reach far to get our arms around, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">maybe, you know, that\u2019s what we ought to be exploring and talking about and thinking about. I don\u2019t know. It does seem to me fairly dramatic how little progress and indeed, retrograde progress, I\u2019ve made in making a way for myself professionally which was as I conceived it, kind of the objective of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">us working together \u2013 you know, with all of the obviously caveats to me made there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: That\u2019s kind of not what you do and I appreciate that but in terms of my motivation for kind of seeking psychotherapy, what I imagined would be easier to work in a professional, basically quasi-bureaucratic, or academic environment and that was what I had hoped to do and that project has gone <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">exactly nowhere and in fact it\u2019s farther now than it has ever been since we started talking to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">(Pause): [0:15:41 0:15:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: And maybe that\u2019s good. I definitely don\u2019t rule out that possibility. It\u2019s crossed my mind on numerous occasions. Maybe I\u2019ve very, very much not wanted this and so I\u2019ve not been very good at pursuing it effectively. Possible, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not clear about that thought, but about the first part \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(Pause): [0:16:10 0:16:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I think, I think \u2013 this is going to sound defensive, but there\u2019s really no way around it, I think. I think you\u2019re sort of at the moment blaming therapy and me for \u2013 and sort of constructing this idea that in fact, not only have you not gotten nowhere, but you\u2019ve gone backwards, which I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">going to dispute in a minute. I know it seems obvious to you like how could it be, but I will get there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: In a way of \u2013 in part, a way that you\u2019re kind of shutting down from moving forward, thinking through and pursuing things that you could be doing. Let me explain where I\u2019m coming from. So you were quite happy with the way you left the program actually when you left. You were happy and confident <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">about being able to make things out of the connections you had there and felt actually in the weeks after leaving like your prospects in doing that were quite good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562008\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Not so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I got blown off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Not that you told me about. There were two contacts that you had that you mentioned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. Both of them blew me off. I met with both of them once as requested by this other contact. I sent them information and they never responded. I mean there was a lot else going on by that time with the birth and what have you, but no, I got zero uptake from these people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Alright, well the way you told it at the time was that you were going to put all that stuff on hold and you were really looking forward to taking the time to be home with the baby. Yeah, you were a little nervous about what was going to come after but you felt like this was a great thing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">You were really excited to be doing it. You actually wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be doing anything \u2013 you didn\u2019t quite say that \u2013 you were very excited to be home. Yes, I can see in a way and I can hear sort of echoes of (unclear) because I\u2019m failing at something but really much more I\u2019m excited to be doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">it. I\u2019m happy to be doing it. I\u2019m going to put the work stuff aside for a while. It might be hard to pick up but I\u2019m feeling basically really good about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Okay. There. Useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: You also came in three or four weeks ago maybe, and said, \u2018yeah, I\u2019m really psyched to try my hand at being a writer. I\u2019ve got this idea for a novel. I\u2019ll have some time. I\u2019ve got some space to do it in now. Yeah, who knows? You were very sort of realistic about like I\u2019m not expecting myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">to write the great American novel but also clearly, you\u2019re a good writer and this is actually, I\u2019m pretty sure you put it in these terms and we spoke, both of us, quite positively about it like you caught a passion but something a little like that. You\u2019re excited to be starting out on something \u2013 or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">pursuing something that actually really meant something to you. You didn\u2019t know how it was going to go but that was part of the thing and it felt right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: That was three or four weeks ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">(Pause): [0:20:56 0:21:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: You were pleased about leaving Partners partly because you felt like you had left at the right time and in the right way. You were not (unclear) to having to have gone there but you said, \u2018I have never left under these kind of terms and you know there are fruits from that which I understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">may have \u2013 I don\u2019t know, whatever the metaphor is, but you know I have people I can continue to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I do.

Now, what you just said I think describes Scenario 2 where maybe it is for the next six months or however long, what I really wanted the whole time and what would really make me happy would be to do something completely different in a totally different <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B2\">environment.

I mean, (unclear) (Cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: My formulation had often been something along the lines that Jeffrey was responding to a real world problem in a non-constructive way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s what I mean. Stuff happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: It\u2019s unclear whether the structural phenomenon \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: I agree. I was vague in saying \u201cstuff happens\u201d and Jeffrey \u2013 yes, exactly. We have a whole narrative about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Alright. Fine. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: I mean in my mind it\u2019s fairly clear that your difficulty deciding and thinking in the first place about what you want to do is kind of a similar thing. And it seems to be like you\u2019ve clearly made progress with all of that but if you\u2019re saying, \u2018look Marshall, the whole point of making progress <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">with that is actually: Have a job or a very idea of what job I want and be doing it and make money at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562008\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Oh. No. Well \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Then I don\u2019t get it. Because \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: You don\u2019t get what? Because I thought, I did, at one point, again, initially that it was going to be impossible to sustain the things I wanted to sustain without a job. And I guess I found to my discomfort in some ways, you know, relief, and other ways if you do it right and make a nice relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">and have a good household even when the worst scenario comes to pass, it\u2019s not the end of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: But this also was not the worst case scenario as of a few months ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: As I\u2019m saying, it really doesn\u2019t square for me to say and how we can say like (unclear) clearly you\u2019ve made progress with Jeffrey, how can you say you\u2019re not only nowhere but nowhere in the direction you want to be going. Like I don\u2019t see how that fits together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: So I guess A \u2013 you\u2019re optimism depends on the quality of my reportage about the end end, you know, the analysis of the hand-off. So that\u2019s one important \u2013 you know, my departure. From this track, this network, these people. You know, how good was it? How effective was it? How good was it at <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">preserving options going forward. How good was it at avoiding the sort of dynamic that I previously followed? I\u2019m a little less confident than that I suppose at this at this end. In the moment I was feeling kind of optimistic about that. In retrospect feeling less so whether that\u2019s any more reality <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200952\">based than the first, I\u2019m not sure but my sense is that I kind of did leave. I didn\u2019t finish the kind of bullshit thing that Phil wanted me to do. I said no. I didn\u2019t stick around to see how everything would shake out. And ultimately, as I kind of suspected, the Rwandans just kind of said, \u2018just take <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200953\">a hike,\u2019 and Phil had to bring the whole show back to Boston even though he\u2019s apparently going to be in Egypt with his wife the next year and a half. And I just stayed completely out of the loop so I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s working or if it\u2019s going to work or the funding got renewed or whatever, and frankly <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200954\">don\u2019t care. I\u2019m seeing that departure as a little bit more in the species of and the genus of my previous departures than I did at the very moment. You know, there were some things that I did better and there were some things I did pretty much the same and certainly my just kind of kiss-off and heading <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200955\">off to Grayson Land was very similar. It just had the advantage of having like a motivation or rationale that nobody could poke holes in it. It\u2019s like of course you\u2019re doing this. Of course, given the situation. Nobody would blame me for doing this. So it wasn\u2019t that I did it any differently. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200956\">just that (cross talk). That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: I would have. At the time if it didn\u2019t sound right to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay. Okay. Maybe you\u2019re right. You know, everything is colored right now in my retrospective analysis of these things by A \u2013 the fact that I really was disappointed to be blown off by these two contacts that I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m pretty sure you never mentioned that to me \u2013 which I\u2019m not mentioning now to say, well, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t incorporate that. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m struck if it felt that significant, which I can understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562008\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: It was just about the time I met with one of them in late September and the other of them in late October and at that point you know, birth was imminent. Other shit was going on and I didn\u2019t really have time in my head, I guess, for being disappointed about this but it kind of sucked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Of course it sucked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: I guess I could have pursued them. I said, can I send you an e-mail? You know, my C.V.? And I did and just silence, you know? So maybe I\u2019m not that good a candidate. Maybe my sense of my own skills and experience is an over-estimation. Who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: That certainly doesn\u2019t reflect the way those people responded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, Marshall. I\u2019m feeling very \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I can tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m feeling very \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: And so what I\u2019m wondering is whether I think what you\u2019re doing is kind of tearing a lot of things down. I mean, I imagine you\u2019re tearing yourself down too. And probably most \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: By definition, right? When I\u2019m tearing the therapy down. Yes, if I\u2019m tearing the therapy down I could be doing it one of two ways. Either tearing myself down with it or using it as a way of feeling better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Alright. (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Only if you did hypnosis or something really out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I mean my real point was I think you are doing that in part because it\u2019s safer than kind of looking forward, which I think is very hard. It\u2019s always been hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Okay. That sounds plausible. The safer part \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Certainly more accessible \u2013 let\u2019s put it that way. It\u2019s usual. But I don\u2019t \u2013 I guess so. Here we are. How do I look forward?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: (Laughing) I guess you don\u2019t want to because you know perfectly well how to look forward. You had no problem looking forward to Grayson\u2019s arrival. You knew exactly what needed to be done. And you worked very hard and you\u2019re totally on top of it. It is not an instrumental problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">(Pause): [0:34:27 0:34:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Okay. So given that I\u2019m capable of looking forward and have demonstrated such competency in the past, how do I look forward \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re blaming me because I think there\u2019s a limit of like, look, I think I\u2019m being light about it \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: That may be the right approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: No. But I think there\u2019s something here that\u2019s not \u2013 I think you\u2019re terrified. I think \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m terrified, or not frustrated, I\u2019m terrified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">(Pause): [0:35:23 0:35:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I mean, that seems kind of convenient on your part. A way to put it together is to say that you\u2019re inhibited. You\u2019re inhibited from looking forward because you\u2019re terrified. And when one is inhibited, one tends to get very frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: That is a good (unclear) field theorem.

When one is inhibited it leads to frustration and, yeah. What then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">(Pause): [0:36:40 0:36:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: I think the nature of the inhibition is, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: What you seem to be doing consistently is putting the ball in my court.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Am I doing that right now? No! I thought I was talking it out with you. Or trying to.

But consistent with your method \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Let me elaborate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: If you feel inhibited, you know, or you have helped me to formulate my frustration as an inhibition, then okay, fine. That sounds plausible. But, and I say, okay, I\u2019m inhibited. Don\u2019t just tell me go to it. Why are you putting it in my court?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not how I mean it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Then clarify.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m (Pause), I\u2019m not aware of intending, by saying, \u201cwell you keep putting it in my court\u201d to say, you know, there\u2019s not the implication in my mind and that\u2019s wrong, so go ahead and do it yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: My thought is like maybe we can get something from \u2013 maybe we can learn more from the fact that you seem to me to be doing that \u2013 about the nature of inhibition. So like for example, you could say, \u2018well, Marshall \u2013\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">(Pause): [0:39:17 0:40:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: \u2018Well, Marshall, I\u2019m asking you these questions, maybe in a way because I know you want answers although you\u2019re probably not going to give me straight answers to them but in a way because if you answer them I would know I was not as alone in this as I can sometimes feel. Not that I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">think that I have your support or certainly like I don\u2019t have Jennie\u2019s support which I clearly do, but there\u2019s some way when it comes to thinking about my future and what I\u2019m going to do is so \u2013 I feel so cut off and so confused that what I really most is to know there\u2019s someone in it with me right <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F72\">then. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you these questions.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: I could say that, but I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t. But my point is, you know, of all the things you\u2019re doing with this, you know, you could be shutting down. You could be talking about something else. You could be \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: In an angry, homicidal rage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yes. But \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m not that person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re not. And what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re sort of asking me these like, sort of instrumental questions about how to handle this. And so I\u2019m kind of trying to look at that because that may be the next step in to understanding what\u2019s going on. So when I point that out it\u2019s not \u2013 I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">intending that to sort of bounce the ball back in your court in a big way, maybe in a little way in the sense of what to think about that \u2013 what are your thoughts, but not in a big way of like, well, I\u2019m not here to help you deal with that so you figure it out. Which is \u2013 I know more than what you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201032\">saying but I\u2019m just trying to get my point across.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I hear you. I hear you and yet (heavy sigh) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">(Pause): [0:41:52 0:42:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">CLIENT: I mean at one point you formulated or you analogized this, I think this very difficulty \u2013 kind of seeing into the future and where I want to be and I don\u2019t know, proprioception \u2013 I guess that\u2019s the analogy that I\u2019ve used and I think it\u2019s a reasonable one. An interesting one at least. You made <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">the analogy of fear of spiders at one point. You said, \u2018you know, it\u2019s like you have a fear of spiders and you kind of have to address it in those terms.\u2019 Now, I\u2019m not saying there has to be something completely instrumental like I\u2019m saying, \u2018well, you know, maybe I have to compound the pill myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201092\">but I want some pharmaceutical agent.\u2019 I\u2019m saying, well, you know, here\u2019s something at least in our understanding of it, is fairly concrete by now. It\u2019s like a thing. And I\u2019m saying the thing is making me stuck and I\u2019m saying well in your experience when people have such things \u2013 what\u2019s the range of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201093\">things they can do for them? I guess you can call that me reaching for something instrumental, but really I\u2019m just saying well you\u2019re a therapist, you know, professionally. You are a psychologist and you see lots of people which means that you have a fairly good baseline or you see \u2013 you have a fairly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201094\">good range from which to triangulate on these kinds of inhibitions. You know, what works in your experience? That kind of a question which I think was kind of clearly, the way that I was framing it, however frustrated my affect may have been, why is that instrumental?
