It\u2019s just like, \u201cWait, this isn\u2019t fun for you all the time?\u201d (laughs) So, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">It\u2019s been pretty up and down. I almost missed my bus (ph) because I Well I didn\u2019t actually almost miss my bus, I just was like twelve minutes later than I meant to be. I was supposed to leave fifteen minutes earlier. But I was packing and kind of tired and stressed out and not doing very well and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">I, in the process of looking for my camera charger, which still hasn\u2019t (inaudible at 00:04:15), I found a letter of recommendation that my advisor at William &amp; Mary had written for my PhD application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: And I read it, which was just a really, really bad idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

She said I might be the best graduate student that she had in thirty years. And I definitely wanted a [top tier degree] (ph). (inaudible). I just couldn\u2019t stop crying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">It was interesting talking with Candace. So Candace didn\u2019t do a PhD until after William &amp; Mary and sort of all of her advisors were like, \u201cYou should really do this.\u201d You know, one of them said, \u201cYeah, go do something else but come back for a PhD before too long because it\u2019s really like this stuff doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">stay in your head that long.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">And she had sort of like been talking about applying but kind of keeps pushing it back for a year. But she also is just so, like she just has no patience for the pretention of graduate students, just none whatsoever. (laughs) She\u2019s like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you use normal words?\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559821\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">So I was asking her about And it was like, \u201cI wanted to read to you about (inaudible 00:06:13) You know, and she was kind of naming a couple of things and pulled out her notes from the class that she had taken on it to kind of look for something. But she was reading titles of response papers that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">other students had written about. And she was like, \u201cGive me a fucking break.\u201d (laughs) You know what I mean? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">I don\u2019t know how much of that is But I think it\u2019s, honestly, I think it\u2019s worse in theology than it is in Bible in terms of, you know, I think people are like talking about human salvation. And so they take themselves very, very seriously. Bible people don\u2019t take themselves that seriously. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">know though if it just bothers me less than it does her.

And, yeah, I think both of us are sad about that in different ways. I think for her, I think she is really sad about the fact that nobody really listens to what she has to say because she doesn\u2019t have a PhD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m just really sad about not doing that anymore.

I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just being nostalgic because I don\u2019t really remember having to have a bitch fest with her about this at least once <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">a week. (laughs) So, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">(pause) And I\u2019m just so sad about that and it doesn\u2019t go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">(very long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: You know, but then I was kind [reeling from the that] (ph).
