data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Let\u2019s see, most immediate, marriage counselor number two this morning at eight o\u2019clock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Eight o\u2019clock in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Ooph. How was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well, I was able to be solidly in my truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Which, when you\u2019re posed the hard questions...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Which hard questions were you posed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So do you love your wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow, right off the bat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: No, not I mean at the end of the session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And I think that that was probably the most drastic. I was prepared, not that I had rehearsed it, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: ...it was like okay, what\u2019s going on here. And it\u2019s like I really, probably, subconsciously, spent the weekend doing that work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I had an opportunity I got a text from my brother last week and he says hey and I don\u2019t know if I talked about this dynamic. When I grew up it was me and my three younger brothers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. And they invited you to brothers\u2019 weekend, right? Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So I went and it was great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: We sat out in an open air beer garden and got there around, I don\u2019t know, 5:30, 6:00, and just sat there drinking cheap beer til 11:00, 11:30. It was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: It was a great time. I\u2019ve had more beer in the last month than I\u2019ve had in eight years. But it was great therapy, belly laughs, and not too many tears but some pretty solid sharing.  It\u2019s like I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m having this kind of level of conversation with these guys. Turns out that three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">of the four of us have married adult survivors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh my goodness, you\u2019re kidding me. Whoa. What do you make of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: We\u2019re fucked up. We\u2019re all fucked up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: What sort of how did you guys come to that conclusion? I mean that\u2019s pretty meaningful data. And what do you make of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: That I think it\u2019s within our family system to have grown up, I think, with a really kind of controlling mother whose love was very conditional. That\u2019s me and my take on it.  So I know that women who are in those kind of what little I know, and I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time studying this, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">it\u2019s like control is a really important thing for survivors. And it\u2019s like so if my if the way I operate, and the way I did operate, is my self-esteem is wrapped around pleasing somebody who\u2019s really controlling and conditional in their love. And I\u2019m like I think we all learned how to dance to that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200472\">tune. And the one brother who didn\u2019t marry, he\u2019s got a voice. He\u2019s confident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: In his relationship or just in general?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: In general. They had problems in their relationship, probably about ten years ago, and he didn\u2019t stand for it then.  Threw the card on the table and it\u2019s like we either fix this or I\u2019m the fuck out of there. It\u2019s like he didn\u2019t my youngest brother is married somebody who\u2019s bipolar and a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">survivor, and her take on how she deals with her sexuality is 180 degrees to my wife. And I also know that that\u2019s a response too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So she wants sex...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: All the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: All the time, yeah, which could be the mania component as well as...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: It could be both of those things. But he\u2019s in as loveless a relationship as I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Wow, even though the physical component is there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Oh, and he says, when I\u2019ve shared it with the handful of people that I\u2019ve shared it with, it\u2019s like everybody says well what\u2019s wrong with that. I\u2019m like no. I mean when you feel like your wife is berating you and yelling at you all night long and then expects you to have sex on top of that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">no.  It\u2019s like no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: So how, because there\u2019s an interesting dynamic that\u2019s happened as you have found your voice in saying I\u2019m not putting up with this anymore, even starting a few months ago, it\u2019s actually brought you closer to your family, your siblings especially, because I remember you were talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">talking to your brother\u2019s wife, and you had some conversations with your brothers, and lo and behold you discovered these themes; this weekend was a solidification of those themes. How do you think you were able to go from a place of being kind of not connected to your brothers and your family to within <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">a few months being sort of having an affinity with them of similarity of experiences?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: How do I think that\u2019s possible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Because that\u2019s quick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: It is quick. I think that the initial thing that comes to mind, and I\u2019m just throwing it off the top of my head, so I don\u2019t know, is that I think that there was an element of control about our relationship, and it\u2019s like whether it was her job or the amount of exposure that I got to my family, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">there was a sense of and whether that was even spoken or not, but it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: You mean your wife or your mother? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Wife.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: And because she worked on the weekends all the time there\u2019s this expectation that well, you\u2019re going to be here for that. It\u2019s like shit with my family happens on the weekends because everybody else works during the week. So just over time not connecting with these people you just kind of slowly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">drift out of people\u2019s lives. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that, yeah, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s just the first thing that comes to mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: What else did you discover in the counsel of brothers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: That I felt like in telling my story, in kind of filling in some of the bits and pieces of where I was at, I think that I\u2019ve come, over the week, to kind of recognize that the revelation of sexual abuse and her history and then finding about it finding out about it in my marriage 12 years <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">in, was a really traumatic moment for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: That I that it was this freeze frame moment that I\u2019m like didn\u2019t know what to do with. Did I tell you the story about the FBI coming and raiding my business and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Okay. A couple of years ago we had a boarder living in the house, a friend of ours living in the house. And a young kid, just got out of violin making school. And I was getting him set up to so one morning I\u2019m sitting there typing away at my computer, and all of a sudden I\u2019ve got three armed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">deputies from the county holding guns at my head telling me to back away from my computer.  And within 30 seconds me and my employee are handcuffed and standing on the porch of my business and I\u2019m like...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Goodness!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: We\u2019re laughing at each other, it\u2019s like well this is not your typical morning. And it then it became clear within a few minutes they weren\u2019t after us, that they were breaking the door in on my house to go get Eddie who was upstairs and long story, he was involved in child porn stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: And of course you had no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: No. And no repercussions came of that. And ultimately but the point being I had absolutely no idea what to do with being handcuffed and having armed deputies holding a gun to my head. And when they were doing that there wasn\u2019t terror, there wasn\u2019t fear.  It was I\u2019ve got nothing for this except <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">is this a joke?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right, kind of surreal a bit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: It was kind of surreal, and I was kind of laughing about it. It was like okay, I\u2019ll go outside, whatever. And I\u2019m like so it was this stupid response to some you could have a number of different responses but mine was kind of disbelief and okay. So I think, initially, that initial revelation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">of sexual abuse, it was like okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: So when you got married there was you didn\u2019t know anything. And can you tell me a little bit because we\u2019ve talked about the fact that you found out, but we never really talked about how and what happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Really. Really? Are you sure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think how you found out. I knew about the priest but how she ended up sharing this with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Well, I was rubbing her shoulders one night, watching television, and this report comes on the about the sex abuse scandal, a priest sex abuse scandal. And she said well I need you to stop rubbing my shoulders now. And it just kind of was funky, and it was like what\u2019s this all about. And it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">kind of remained funky for a few days, and I think we finally ended up going out to eat. I remember the restaurant, the booth, everything about that night. And she\u2019s telling me these stories and she\u2019s telling me about the priest and shared some stuff about her brother when she was a kid and hints at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200872\">potentially this thing that happened between she and a female coach when she was maybe, I don\u2019t know, junior high age. I\u2019m not 100% sure. So I mean it\u2019s like stuff happened and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Okay, and she tells you this at dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yup. But it doesn\u2019t really click in, or maybe it clicks in and I\u2019m just so dumb founded it\u2019s like it\u2019s not just a priest.  It\u2019s the priest that she invited special to come in and marry us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: That I knew, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: So I\u2019m like I think that that piece was so kind of jarring that I\u2019ve I just kind of encapsulated that, I mean that kind of trauma moment or something. It\u2019s like okay, well I can\u2019t feel any of that because she\u2019s the one with dealing that\u2019s with the trauma here. You know what I mean? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: I do. What happened so she tells you all this and you\u2019re kind of numb to it except for the loudest piece of data is the fact that you invited your abuser to marry us, of course. Then how do things proceed after that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: She went to counseling for two or three sessions, and I got some books and was starting to read up a little bit on sexual abuse.  And then it became apparent that she wasn\u2019t going to go back to counseling anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: And so you guys didn\u2019t talk about it after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: We didn\u2019t we talked a little bit about it but it was like the message that eventually became clear is I don\u2019t have a problem, it\u2019s you that has the problem for wanting to have sex all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: So after she told you you\u2019d been having sex up to that point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Or it was getting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: But here\u2019s the deal. We had three kids and were taking care of three old people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Right, I remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: So we\u2019re juggling a lot of balls and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t really remember what that was like except that it was a hell of a lot of work, and was there time in there for us. The last of them had died, and this is probably, I don\u2019t know, a year or two later, I don\u2019t know, this stuff sort of comes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">to light. So it\u2019s like we\u2019re on the kind of the backside of that.  And....<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And it was after she told you that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Then we\u2019re in the slow death spiral of sexual intimacy, eventually getting to the place where it\u2019s like two or three times a year and we have to go out of town and we have to get drunk. And it\u2019s like and clearly it starts to move farther and farther away from intimacy and more and more to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">just the sex act. And it gets really ugly and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m some kind of a sexual predator and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: But you didn\u2019t feel like that before you knew. You weren\u2019t feeling like you were...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: No, but there was always this sense of I\u2019m having that image of Pepe Le Pew. Do you remember that cartoon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m like chasing this cat with the white stripe who keeps finding a way to elude me.  That always felt like that was the nature of it\u2019s like she always had a calendar in hand, and it was always full, and it was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: It strikes me, and I work a lot with individuals who have been sexually abused a lot and do a lot of trauma work, and it strikes me that because you were not able to talk about it, in some ways the messages that you were given were don\u2019t talk about it; let it go. That\u2019s where the hold on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">the marriage was. It\u2019s almost as if things stopped from that point or got stuck there, and because she didn\u2019t want to talk about it and you couldn\u2019t access it, the processing of what should have happened, or even your understanding of how to be supportive or to work together, died right there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: And I had an important realization over the weekend, a memory, wrapped around my operation as a kid.  So I\u2019ve got some freeze frame moments. Okay, so this was obviously a traumatic experience because I\u2019m two years old and I have these clear visual memories of being left alone in a hospital after <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">this surgery. So that was traumatic enough, but then I remember, it\u2019s not like an unclaimed memory, I remember having it before, or a repressed memory, it\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t thought about it in a long time. But I remember standing at my grandmother\u2019s dining room table. She\u2019s sitting at the end of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B32\">the table and I\u2019m thinking that I must\u2019ve been two-ish after this surgery, could be three-ish. I\u2019m not sure how old I was exactly, but of wanting to tell grandma about my operation. And I don\u2019t know if it was, I really don\u2019t, but that\u2019s the dynamic of what\u2019s going on.  And I can see my mom standing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B33\">in the doorway of the dining room and she\u2019s angry at me. It\u2019s like we don\u2019t talk about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I remember you telling me that last week, which is you did because I remember having a really strong reaction to it, having a two year old thinking my God...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Okay, so we did talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Sure, because at this point in time that frames everything going forward. And then of course it makes sense. You marry someone who we don\u2019t talk about sex, we don\u2019t ever talk about sexual things, right. And so when things go bad around sex, sexual abuse, sexual feelings, things die. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">in some ways at two you almost lost your you lost your mom because you\u2019re going through this painful experience, right, and if you\u2019re two you need someone to comfort and love you, and now you lost her because you can\u2019t talk about it. To anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: So I\u2019m abandoned in the hospital, and then I get this really strong message that there\u2019s something seriously wrong about you and we\u2019re not going to talk about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yes, so you\u2019ve always come to learn something\u2019s wrong with you about sex. Something\u2019s wrong with you physically, something\u2019s wrong with you emotionally, you want to talk about it, you want to have it, something\u2019s wrong with you. But really and what a lie that is because there\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">wrong with everybody else surrounding it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, so fast forward, here we are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Sure, here we are. Interesting that your brothers got the same messages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, I mean we never talked about sex, period, in the family. And you grow up in a Christian family it\u2019s like sex is bad anyway. [laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Sure, everything about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s absolutely nothing redeeming about it at all. So yeah, so there...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I imagine because of the physical condition you are going to be more sensitive, and because of who you are you\u2019re going to be more sensitive to it anyway.  So whereas if you take your brothers have clearly [inaudible] impacted, and I\u2019m sure your sister, too, but if you\u2019re a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">more emotionally intuitive kid, and you probably were, it\u2019s going to impact you even more. And then you go ahead and add on the surgery and the fact I mean you can\u2019t even tell Grandma. We you can\u2019t talk to us about it but you can\u2019t even tell Grandma either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Right, right, right, yeah. You can\u2019t talk to anybody about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: So you understand why you went into a deep freeze yourself for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Oh my God, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Because everything you\u2019ve learned has said don\u2019t talk about it, don\u2019t mention it. And it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s always due to somebody else\u2019s discomfort, not your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: So and I was able to go there. It was like the it\u2019s interesting, having being junior counselor now, coming into these counseling sessions, and it\u2019s like so she sits down and I\u2019m thinking okay, probably a couple of questions, kind of build the alliance a little bit.  So what brings you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">in today? Okay, well this is kind of just let\u2019s get to work. Here we are. It\u2019s like okay, so she backs up a little bit and just kind of asks some demographic information, but it\u2019s like okay, whatever, I\u2019ll launch into the story. And I\u2019m like so here\u2019s me; this is how we got here. And I\u2019m spelling out <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D32\">the story of the childhood and I\u2019m spelling out the story of working through some of this shit in counseling [inaudible] and I\u2019m a counseling student, blah, blah, blah, and I\u2019ve been working on and trying to lay as much of the detail out there as I can. And it\u2019s like I\u2019ve got some serious issues about shame.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And what does Mary do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: She\u2019s sitting there; she\u2019s listening. So it\u2019s not like she\u2019s rejecting any of that. It\u2019s kind of like she\u2019s heard it all before. I just don\u2019t think that she gets any of the connection between the fact that I\u2019ve been shut out of a physical and emotional relationship for seven or eight years and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">that I should just have all of these feelings of affection and love for her. It\u2019s like so I\u2019m just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: So you say all these things and then tell me a little bit about what happens in the session. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Well then she gives her an opportunity to talk and it\u2019s like well, what\u2019s your take on all of this. And it\u2019s like well everything basically that Seamus\u2019 been shut down for a really long time. And I\u2019ve been trying to do everything that I can to reach him and he just doesn\u2019t respond. And then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">yeah, I may have the chronologic so I\u2019ll just keep throwing stuff out there.  But there\u2019s the sense of then that six weeks ago we go out on this date to Detroit, and I really thought that this would be a great opportunity for us to reconnect. And we got these tickets so that we\u2019d have this opportunity <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB2\">to go see these shows in Detroit all year long. It was a way for us to kind of, now that we\u2019re empty nesters, to reconnect. And so he tells me at dinner that, it was interesting how she put it, that he didn\u2019t want me to kiss him anymore, or to touch him anymore, that it only reminded him of everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB3\">that he couldn\u2019t have and he just he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with me anymore. So okay, that\u2019s I can see how she\u2019s interpreting that that way.  So it\u2019s kind of like in her world she\u2019s been doing everything that she can to keep everything going, and then all of a sudden one day, boom, he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB4\">just said this is crazy, I can\u2019t live like this anymore. So this huge disconnect for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: And how did the counselor make sense of the data? Because I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how we got to do you still love your wife, which is kind of a provocative question in a first session, or can be. So how did she make sense of your mutual stories and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking, now this is just me being a little intuitive, like what\u2019s going on because I saw it. I felt like the same thing was happening with the other counselor. And it\u2019s like I\u2019m throwing this information out there, that hey we\u2019ve got an issue with sexual childhood abuse here, and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">is what I\u2019m reacting to and why I\u2019ve shut down. And I\u2019m just thinking.  I could be completely wrong about this, but she\u2019s like I think that she sees that there\u2019s a serious fucking problem here. And it\u2019s like we need to know what are we even interested in trying to fix this fucking mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yes, which is more intuitive than counselor one, who wants to do solution focused let\u2019s get in touch with your memories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well she\u2019s an LCW.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Licensed clinical social worker. And the yeah, counselor one, who\u2019s like but counselor one, after I got through my story he\u2019s like I could feel him going holy shit. That was my take on that, especially after her reaction in kind of losing it in there. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: How did you answer the question do you still love your wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Then I said well, I\u2019m going to have to answer from a place of complete honesty here, and this is not a comfortable place for me to be.  But I said my experience of having lived for seven or eight years in a relationship where and I spelled it out in terms of hey, not only has it been no physical <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">relationship, but because when my daughter went off to school she transferred all of her emotional relationship to her friend. So I\u2019ve been living in this place of no emotional relationship and no physical relationship for eight years. And it\u2019s like my experience is I feel like I\u2019m just crawling out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB2\">of the desert at this point. And I\u2019m operating at a place I\u2019m operating in a deficit place. And this isn\u2019t anything that I haven\u2019t said to Mary two or three times. And it\u2019s like this is where I\u2019m at. So did I say the words I don\u2019t love her anymore, no, I didn\u2019t, but I just said this is where it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB3\">at. And I said and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to be able to bring to this right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And how did things end in the session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: We did end up making another session for a couple of weeks down the road. She\u2019s on vacation next week, so it\u2019s two weeks to let this kind of marinate and see where it goes. But the question\u2019s out there. It\u2019s like so, do you think that you two ought to separate for awhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: She asked that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Okay. And?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: And she asked Mary do you love your husband, and she\u2019s like oh, yes. I deeply, and I\u2019m and all that kind of thing. And then it\u2019s like so I see this, she\u2019s saying those words, but then it\u2019s like just beneath the veneer of that there\u2019s so much anger, and it\u2019s like but I\u2019m not willing I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">mean if he\u2019s not on board with any of this stuff, then I want him out of the house right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: This is what she\u2019s saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is understandable to a certain degree but I\u2019m like, again, I\u2019m back in that place of and maybe that\u2019s completely fair but it\u2019s just like okay, I\u2019m in this place of really conditional, a conditional understanding of this relationship. It\u2019s like this is these are the conditions. It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It seems, though, that things the ante has been upped a bit, right, so we\u2019re not there\u2019s movement, you may not know the direction, but if she\u2019s saying I mean what would it be like for you to move out of the house if that\u2019s what the two of you decide?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Part of me, I just wandered around the sculpture park for an hour and I\u2019m just like what does all that feel like to me. What does that really feel like? What am I feeling now after this session? And I\u2019m just wandering around; it\u2019s like I\u2019m not feeling all knotted up inside. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not, I can tell.

There\u2019s a part of me that knows definitely that this relationship, the relationship the way it has been, is not healthy for me anymore.  It hasn\u2019t been healthy for me for a long time. And it\u2019s not going to be a growth producing relationship for me. Do I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F1\">see any possibility of her changing? I don\u2019t hold out a hell of a lot of hope of that ever happening. And I\u2019m like I don\u2019t think that I have the energy to sit around and wait for that to happen. She asked her, so Mary, what do you vision this relationship looking like if you go forward. What would you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F2\">like? Well, I\u2019d like to have companionship and I\u2019d like to have the relationship that we had so we can kind of continue on the path, and it\u2019s kind of that grow old together. It\u2019s like and she goes what about sex.  Well I I\u2019m starting to hear what he\u2019s saying, and I get that this is some piece that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F3\">really, really important to him, and I told him that I would be willing to work on that. And so me, hearing those words and the way that I\u2019m interpreting that, it\u2019s like I get to be the caretaker. I get to be I get to continue that role as caretaker. I\u2019ve taken care of the elder members of her family, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F4\">I\u2019ve gotten to take care of her brother. And of course that\u2019s what it should be if you were in this relationship where you felt like there was some mutuality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Sure, although caretaking should switch back and forth. It shouldn\u2019t be a one person, which you sounds like you feel like it has. It strikes me as interesting in some ways because you guys are clearly in two different places, where nobody wants to really have sex with somebody who doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201111\">want it back.  So I\u2019m hearing now it\u2019s important to you so I\u2019ll work on it, but I don\u2019t really want it too, which doesn\u2019t make you so you\u2019re in this place of kind of deep honesty and truth, and she wants to go back to the way things were which is a place that\u2019s intolerable for you. And for her to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201112\">really kind of go bring what you might need to the relationship would be such deep emotional work because the sexual abuse and your marriage are interrelated, and she\u2019d really have to do that you can\u2019t work on one without the other. So she would have to do both, and from what you\u2019re saying it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201113\">sound like you think she wants to or is willing or ready to do that kind of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: She may want to but it\u2019s like I don\u2019t think that she wants to for so it\u2019s like okay, I don\u2019t know how to put this.  It\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with somebody who feels like well, okay, I\u2019ll work really hard at doing all of this hard work that I need to do around sexuality <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201131\">if it\u2019s so important to you. And I\u2019m just well how cheap and dirty does that make me feel. And I\u2019m just like and then I\u2019m supposed to tell you that I love you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Sure. Do you feel like you are supposed to tell her that you love her?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: No. Well I mean that\u2019s what she\u2019d like to hear but I\u2019m not in that place of being able to say that. I was able to yell it out loud in this beer garden after who knows how many cheap beers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yell what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like Jesus Christ guys, I\u2019m telling you, I didn\u2019t want to be this guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Which guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Who\u2019s going to sit here at the table and tell you it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even fucking like her anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: Right, you didn\u2019t want to be the person to say those words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t want to be in that place, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: Well, but again, here\u2019s another theme here. Why is it that guy? That guy always has these negative connotations about you\u2019re a bad person. And what guy are you except the guy who\u2019s unhappy in this marriage? Why do you have to be that guy? That goes back to all the shit with perfection that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201251\">we talked about. You\u2019re not any guy. You\u2019re Seamus, who\u2019s unhappy in this marriage, who refuses to kind of go along to get along and not be honest about the fact that he\u2019s not unhappy. That doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re that guy. It just means you\u2019re Seamus who\u2019s fucking unhappy. But we always go back to that Seamus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. It\u2019s words. I just yeah. And I used them again in the session this morning. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: Are those your words, Mary\u2019s words, or both? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: Probably both. It\u2019s like that sense of this is not where I wanted this to be. This is not where I wanted this to be. This is not where I thought this relationship was going to be 26 years ago. But here we are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s the grief piece, okay, and that is a very valid, sensitive, painful place. But why does being in that place make you a bad person? Because that guy is synonymous with bad guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Right, and it\u2019s because in her world...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: What about yours?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah, in my world I\u2019m just unhappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Right, but why do you continue to frame it as that guy? I understand you can frame it as I didn\u2019t want to be in this place or that place, but it always has to do with your personhood or your character. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: Well I think it\u2019s just too long of living in that schema. Too long of my worth or my existence or whatever is going to revolve around what you think of me, what you think of me, what you think of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m going to call you on it every time I hear it because if you are going to be truthful, that\u2019s not the truth. Again, and I remember when my parents split up, both of them said I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be in this place; this is not how we thought this would go. It was painful for both of them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201391\">And I know as couples break up, there\u2019s guilt, there\u2019s shame, there\u2019s a whole lot of things. But you are not a bad person because you\u2019re admitting to being unhappy and refusing to be unhappy. You\u2019re not that guy. You\u2019re just Seamus who\u2019s unhappy, who refuses and it\u2019s intolerable to remain unhappy <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201392\">and silent about it. That doesn\u2019t make you that guy, it actually makes you a brave guy, because quite frankly, if you had shut the fuck up you could do this for 25 more years, right, and then you\u2019d look back and be like really? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, or I\u2019d probably just end up shutting down so much I\u2019d just be drooling in my oatmeal some place.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2013A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Could be.

It\u2019s like yes, yes, yes, you\u2019re 100% right. And yes, I need to stop using that language because it is clearly powerful. Language is clearly powerful, and as long as I continue to use that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F1\">going to be continuing to frame myself that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: Is Mary a bad person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">THERAPIST: Is she that woman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">CLIENT: No, she has some issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s got some deep issues, right, that may be too painful for her to look at. And if she\u2019s not that woman, and I haven\u2019t heard you describe her even in your anger as that woman or but she when she says I didn\u2019t think you were that guy who would want sex or whatever, that you cannot ingest <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201491\">that.  You cannot ingest you have to take it out of yourself because you can\u2019t have I\u2019m going to live in truth in one part and lie to myself on the other about being a bad person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">CLIENT: And listening yeah, listening to the crap on the other side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">THERAPIST: You can listen to it but you don\u2019t have to take it in yourself. You\u2019re just and you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s unhappy, your brothers are. That doesn\u2019t make...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">CLIENT: And if she owns it she\u2019s unhappy too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">THERAPIST: Who, Mary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I\u2019m sure, especially now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">CLIENT: And she has been unhappy.

That\u2019s come up a couple of times where she says I\u2019ve done all these things and you\u2019re just shut down. What do you make of that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I am shut down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Do you see in your kind of recent past that she has reached out to you and you haven\u2019t responded?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s always these in my interpretation it\u2019s always these reaching out over the top of the wall...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: For a pat on the head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah, or I\u2019ll give you a kiss on the cheek in the morning on the way out the door or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So in some ways you guys have gotten to a place where you can\u2019t really reach each other anymore, not in the ways that you need it. And maybe you want two different things out of the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Clearly. Clearly.

That\u2019s the sexual component piece. That\u2019s the physical and the emotional, boom, everything\u2019s in vulnerability. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">THERAPIST: But it is what she wants.

And that\u2019s intimacy. That\u2019s what she wants. And I\u2019m like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201771\">got nothing for me. And maybe she wants something deeper than that.

It\u2019s like so do you know what you want. What are you really hoping to get out of couples counseling at this point? And I\u2019ve thought about that. So part of me is like I know part of me just wants to be heard. Part of me wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201871\">to be heard and validated by somebody, maybe in her presence, that I\u2019m not fucking crazy.  And is that a revenge thing? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know. I really feel like do I have a lot of hope of this thing, being able to pull this thing out? Not really. Because I know that one of the big <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201872\">components is going to be me being all in in trying to work and make this thing happen. Today, where I\u2019m sitting, I can\u2019t do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like this is part of the process, so if you view it as a process that leads to whatever end result, it\u2019s not only kind of about being heard but being seen, right, and coming to some resolution, even if it\u2019s to clarify you both want different things or to clarify the fact that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201891\">you\u2019re done or to clarify the fact that you want to try whatever it is, right. It\u2019s not that your doubts are valid and it\u2019s not that I wonder if this is a waste of your time because this is the first time in a long time the two of you have come together to talk about the deeper issues.  And so in some <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201892\">ways I think when you have been married as long as you have been married, you have to do due diligence on the relationship, even if you think it\u2019s going to go a certain way so that when all is said and done you look back and you said look, right, I\u2019m at peace with this because I did due diligence. If <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201893\">you packed up, left, and filled divorce papers out tomorrow, my sense is that you might be really uncomfortable with that because even though this may be where this thing ends up, you\u2019re not ready for that piece yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">CLIENT: No, and I feel like yeah, irregardless of what happens, I\u2019m always going to be connected to this person, in one way or another. I mean we\u2019re going to have we\u2019ve shared three kids together. We are parents together. And it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Have a history together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">CLIENT: We have a history together. And ultimately I think that she\u2019s a really good person, and she\u2019s got some really deep issues, and I\u2019m not sure that I can be the guy that\u2019s going to help her get through those issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">THERAPIST: Right.

I wonder and I hope that if you whatever you take from this, it\u2019s to never be silenced again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that there\u2019s really a part of me that no, it\u2019s I feel like I\u2019ve really I have this image of holding on to that two year old child and it\u2019s like yeah, you know what, I\u2019ve got you and you ain\u2019t fucking going to get hurt again. I\u2019ve got you on this. So there\u2019s sort of that <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F1\">sense of like yeah, I can speak. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, clearly, because you keep doing it consistently. It\u2019s almost and when you turn a corner, sometimes you just can\u2019t go back to the place...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t go back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">THERAPIST: But not only in this relationship, but forevermore, to not be silenced to the point where shame and guilt and doubt back you into a corner and you can\u2019t get out of the corner because of all these old messages because the messages are might be true to the person who provides the message <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A51\">but not for you. We don\u2019t talk about sex in this house because I, the parent, am uncomfortable with it. Not because it\u2019s wrong or bad or you shouldn\u2019t talk about it, right. Because I don\u2019t want to hear about it, you shouldn\u2019t talk about it. And that\u2019s a terrible message to send to a child. Like you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A52\">imprisoned this poor two year old because you\u2019re uncomfortable with the topic.  Therefore his feelings and issues with it means there\u2019s something wrong with him, which is the message that the two year old got. None of that is true. It\u2019s never been true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A7\">CLIENT: No, and I get that, and you\u2019re and I really do feel that. And it\u2019s like but I recognize that in our relationship, that marriage relationship, that the communication system is so fucked up that I don\u2019t even know how to begin. And it\u2019s not like we can come at this from a place of okay, let\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A71\">go have dinner together and try to sort this out. It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Which may be what she\u2019s thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Why is it this deep at this point when it hasn\u2019t been for this long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF\">CLIENT: Right, and her take on all of this is that I\u2019ve gone crazy. It\u2019s like she said I hear what Seamus is saying and I hear that he\u2019s saying that he\u2019s being honest right now, but that\u2019s not what I believe.  I believe that he\u2019s not being true to himself. He\u2019s not being authentic. He is he\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF1\">being the person that he\u2019s been all of his life and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Sure, well, and who she\u2019s known you to be because that\u2019s been the investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B3\">CLIENT: And I get that. I get that. But that\u2019s yeah, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Where are you I don\u2019t want to forget to ask you this with last week we started talking about some crushes, some fantasies, that you were having.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B7\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, well I think where I\u2019m at with that is recognizing that is it a crush so much as it\u2019s recognizing that there\u2019s potential here for relationships and there\u2019s potential here and there\u2019s wow, here\u2019s somebody who\u2019s mature and got their head on straight. And it\u2019s like I recognize and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201B71\">recognizing that okay, clearly I need to be I don\u2019t need these things to be overlapping right now.  But it\u2019s recognizing okay, you know what, I\u2019ve got a friend here now, and a friend that I can talk to, and I\u2019m not really wanting to stop that. I can put some pretty clear boundaries on this and I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201B72\">be okay with this but it\u2019s like oh my God, this is what this could\u2019ve been a long time ago. It\u2019s like oh my God, I can talk to somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B9\">THERAPIST: And what\u2019s that like for you to have the realization of having emotional intimacy with a female friend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BB\">CLIENT: What is that like for me? That\u2019s like a drink of water after being in the desert for so damn long. It\u2019s just like just to have a 15 or 20 minute conversation with somebody who\u2019s willing to sit there and listen to me and just take it in.  And I recognize okay, this person over here, she doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201BB1\">have 26 years\u2019 worth of my baggage. And it\u2019s like and I don\u2019t want to go down the road of oh, this is all new and shiny and this is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. It is nice to recognize that there\u2019s a possibility some day of something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BF\">CLIENT: Oh clearly. I mean it\u2019s like and I recognize that there are so many old bad stories about myself that I\u2019m pretty much sure that I can let down. I can let go of those now. It\u2019s like not lovable, [buzzer sound]. Not a good looking guy, [buzzer sound]. I get all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Well how did you get that so fast?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, but this is like the turning on the switch. It\u2019s like I really can\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, maybe I maybe I\u2019ve just never talked to anybody else that\u2019s had this experience, of just like night and day. It\u2019s like the switch came on one day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C5\">THERAPIST: You remember we talked about how you get all these positive messages about yourself from the environment, from here, from professors, from other students, and you weren\u2019t able to, one, pay that much attention to them or two, internalize them because of you being entrenched in your own narrative <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C51\">of negativity. And then it is like turning on a light because you\u2019re not anymore. And so now you\u2019re able to go oh wow, look at all of this; I didn\u2019t even see this. But it\u2019s been there more consistently than you think it has.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C7\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, of course. But it\u2019s like that moment of the switch coming on. It\u2019s like just such a huge watershed of everything. And it\u2019s like oh my God, I have been so wrong about so much stuff for so long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Well you\u2019ve been told a lot of things. It\u2019s amazing what we get told through other people\u2019s issues or discomfort about ourselves, right, so if you can you imagine, if you are not an emotionally healthy person, what is the message you pass on to your children about life, about themselves, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C91\">that they learn from the parents. And you got some of that from yours. I mean we all get it from our parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N201C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and how much did I pass on to my kids.

We had to do that. We\u2019re two people that didn\u2019t deal with our issues for 26 years. And some of that stuff\u2019s going to be job security for some counselor down the road. But yeah, so what do I think about that relationship?  I think that trying to hold some healthy boundaries <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201CF1\">on that, but you know what, I\u2019m okay with having friends. And it\u2019s like I\u2019ve got a special friend and I\u2019ve got other people that are close friends, and it\u2019s like these people are my network. And I\u2019m like I\u2019m okay with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not a network you recognized or spoke about four months ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D3\">CLIENT: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Right, but as you live in your own truth, speak it, live in it, it\u2019s opened up all these other relationships. Six months ago I remember you saying there\u2019s nobody except for your male friend, who is male to female, transsexual friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D7\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D9\">THERAPIST: But now you\u2019ve got more family relationships, friend relationships, that you are open to you because of your truth. Isn\u2019t that pretty incredible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201DB\">CLIENT: It is pretty incredible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Because it\u2019s pretty quick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201DF\">CLIENT: It is pretty quick, and it\u2019s like recognizing well yeah, you know what? Those relationships were really always potentially there.  It\u2019s just me not being open to them. And what\u2019s changed is that this relationship over here, which has been really pretty unhealthy for me, and I\u2019m dancing around <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201DF1\">trying to stay in orbit around this thing, it\u2019s like if I\u2019m going to recognize that I\u2019m not stuck in that orbit, then it\u2019s like okay, then everything else is opened up. So it\u2019s like all right, I\u2019m no longer focusing on that; now I can focus on I\u2019ve got all this other energy now to focus on all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201DF2\">these other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s a different pain, too, the pain of being stuck. But now you\u2019re in the pain of processing. But there\u2019s forward movement in the processing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I had to trust. I mean I think the only thing at his point that I feel some anxiety about, and I that\u2019s today.  Tomorrow\u2019s going to be a little bit [inaudible] I get that. And I may have completely different feelings tomorrow, but it\u2019s like yeah, if we got to separate, if we got <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201E31\">a divorce, for me it\u2019s about the kids now. I but I don\u2019t have any control over that either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201E5\">THERAPIST: And your concerns would be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201E7\">CLIENT: That I\u2019m going to have strained relationships with my daughter probably, who maybe isn\u2019t going to understand or, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m probably catastrophizing, but I\u2019m that\u2019s more my concern then. And really the financial reality. I\u2019m in a completely financially vulnerable place. I\u2019m like oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201E71\">I\u2019m in grad school, I\u2019m counting on our relationships and that fact that I\u2019ve got an assistantship to kind of get me through, and what am I going to do if this really ends?  It\u2019s like I haven\u2019t even thought about that yet. I\u2019m like I\u2019ve been dealing with all this existential shit and I\u2019m like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201E72\">haven\u2019t even thought about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201E9\">THERAPIST: The practicalities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201EB\">CLIENT: I mean that\u2019s so clearly my goofy ENFP personality type who oh, let\u2019s be all concerned about...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N201EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561972\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201ED\">THERAPIST: But you will think about those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201EF\">CLIENT: When it\u2019s time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know.

Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201FB\">CLIENT: When you\u2019re this hairy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201FD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s definitely ripped off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201FF\">CLIENT: ...you learn how to pull it off fast. And it\u2019s like it really doesn\u2019t hurt that much. There\u2019s an initial shock. I was walking through the sculpture park out here, and the first sculpture I encounter is entitled The Phoenix. And it\u2019s like and they\u2019re telling the story of the phoenix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20201\">THERAPIST: Is that the green and white one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20203\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s the orange one. It kind of just looks and it\u2019s out; you have to walk to it just a little ways. And the phoenix lines a nest with cinnamon twigs and sits in the nest and burns itself up, and it rises out of the ashes. It\u2019s like it clearly feels like that right now. It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20205\">THERAPIST: The rising part, not the burning part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20207\">CLIENT: It\u2019s kind of like burning up a lot of old shit.

And it may be there\u2019s a sense of new arising that\u2019s coming out of that at the same time, but it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20209\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2020B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really hard work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2020D\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2020F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20211\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re doing it.
