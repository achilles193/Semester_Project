And what happens? I says it gives out, you know. He looked at the x-rays that they had taken, and he says, \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ll go in and scrape and see what else needs to be done when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">I have it\u201d.

But no, he\u2019s just doing some orthoscopics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I mean, yeah, at this point everything\u2019s serious surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I said, with my luck I\u2019ll go in for the knee and come out with, you know, needing a heart transplant or some goddamn thing.

Well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: And then after the knee, we started on cortisone shots for the shoulder that I broke there. So if the cortisone shots don\u2019t work, which they\u2019re ... really, the first one hasn\u2019t, we\u2019re going to need a new shoulder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: A new shoulder? Oh my gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: A shoulder replacement. Yeah. Because right now it\u2019s bone on bone. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: I said, okay, so I\u2019ll go for the knee, the shoulder, and maybe the hernia. [Laughter]. Maybe I should go for the hernia first, because they said the shoulder\u2019s like an eight to ten month recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, I imagine. Yeah, yeah. I could see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: So I says yeah, okay, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: So they\u2019re, just cutting you open all over the place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, we might as well just go for it. Get me while you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What is it like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: All right. I\u2019m hoping this will finally, you know, do the deal, but he said, \u201cWell Louise, when you broke it the second time, we had to put a rod up your leg, remember, because your femur bone was sticking up through it?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: Your femur was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t know this about your femur.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. The second time. Well, I had the first surgery in \u201806, and then the following year, in \u201807, I fell out of bed, and my femur bone was sticking right up through the implant. The knee. So they put a rod up there, they re-fixed the total knee, and do you know when they do this surgery, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200671\">they have to have the guy that makes, someone from the company that makes these things?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563389\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I hear they\u2019re doing more and more of that, the people from the actual device, who sell the devices will have a rep there so they can tell the surgeon what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: How to implant it. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: I says, oh. Okay. So, that was that, you know. I said I don\u2019t mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: What about that, to you, having that person there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t faze me. I just hope, you know, it gets to feel better. Because it hurts like a sucker. You know. I told him I have a hard time getting in and out of cars. I said I can\u2019t lift my leg up like this, I lift it over. I said if they stick me in the back seat, I gotta put my hand down and slide <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">up. He says all right, we\u2019ll see what we can do. I says, oh thank you very much. And then yesterday I went to Rhode Island Eye and Ear to see about a hearing aid, and she said I didn\u2019t have enough loss in this ear to qualify for a hearing aid. It has to be, like, 38 to 40 per cent. And I only have 30 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200752\">per cent loss in it. I said, oh wonderful. And, if you need a hearing aid, it\u2019s $200 down when you go for your first visit, and then it\u2019s $1800 when you have your, when you pick up your hearing aid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm. It\u2019s costly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Two thousand bucks. I mean, I don\u2019t know where they think the hell I\u2019m going to get that money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I\u2019ll just be there with a tin can, go \u201cHey!\u201d. So they tell me that if I\u2019m having a conversation with a person, I have to be able to see them, and it can\u2019t be off this way, and if I\u2019m, I have to, like if Deborah was over there talking, I would have to turn this ear to her. No out-of-room <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">conversations. I can\u2019t be in the bedroom and yell out to Deborah or her yell out to me to answer something, because I can\u2019t hear what the hell she\u2019s saying. I have to stare at people and be able to learn to read lips. I said, well I know sign language, and she says you do? And I says yeah. I don\u2019t think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F2\">she liked that too much, but I didn\u2019t give a shit. Uh huh. So I says okay, you know. And then they gave a list of things that Deborah should do. Deborah says yeah right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: These were suggestions of how to live with the 30% hearing loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: So I said yeah, okay, fine. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well there\u2019s just like, there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough kind of, help for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: No, no. No help. My tooth that I went did I tell you I went to the dentist from Amherst health and alliance? Because my dentist won\u2019t take me because of my insurance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: So, I called Amherst Health Alliance, and they had the dental, so I called and they said, \u201cOh we\u2019re not taking any new patients\u201d. I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a member of Amherst Health Alliance.\u201d I said, \u201cNo other dentist will take me because of my insurance, and I have a tooth that needs to be pulled\u201d. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200911\">So they told me to come in like, three days after I talked to them. So I went over there, and it took her 45 minutes to do x-rays. By the time my x-rays were all done, she didn\u2019t have time to pull my tooth out. So that\u2019s going to be pulled out St. Paddy\u2019s Day. March 17th. But in the meantime, last week <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200912\">I was chewing a piece of gum, and the whole back of my tooth came out.
