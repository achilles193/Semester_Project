Come on in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Morning!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: (pause) I can\u2019t find what the right place to start is, but... Nothing of substance has changed in the intervening time since we\u2019ve seen each other. I sent some applications out; I guess that\u2019s something of substance that\u2019s changed, so that\u2019s a good thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">It\u2019s an amusing circumstance. I have, I sent one on Friday and I sent one on Monday; not heard back from either person. Not that I really expected to, if you will. Kevin will send his letters of recommendation either yesterday, or today, or tomorrow; whenever he gets around to it. So we\u2019ll see how quickly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">they respond after that. I guess that\u2019s really how this process works. He sends them a letter and says, \u201cHey, you should really think about hiring this person,\u201d and they actually think about it, instead of reading the application that I had to write in order for the... (sighs) the world\u2019s a strange place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(pause 00:01:58 to 00:03:16)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So I think I\u2019m very frustrated, because I sort of keep doing all of the incremental things that I ought to be doing, and things are not really getting better. (pause) Yeah, there is a sense in which that\u2019s not true. (inaudible) finished my degree, that\u2019s done! Write some papers, those will go out the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">door eventually. That will be a good thing. I\u2019ve sent out these applications, that\u2019s like, a big step towards the next whatever. Um...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: (pause) But it doesn\u2019t feel that way. It doesn\u2019t feel like there is progress being made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or, yeah, and maybe that\u2019s because I don\u2019t have a clear sense of where any of it is going towards. You know, it\u2019s progress, but... (chuckles) if you wandered through the desert, you can make a lot of progress and still not get anywhere. Not that... (pause) I guess I don\u2019t have a particularly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">clear picture of where anything is headed, or where I actually want it to head. (pause) If doing a post-doc (ph) is a step along a particular career path that I\u2019m doing, because... (pause) I like some aspects of the end career, but I sort of wonder, will I ever find something that I actually just like? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">Or is this all there is? You know like, some pieces of this, some parts of it are going to suck. That sort of describes my relationship also, with Tanya. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: (pause) It sounds like you\u2019re wondering, Is this all there is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(pause 00:06:47 to 00:08:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I think that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(pause 00:08:06 to 00:11:34)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Um... So, I\u2019ve been sort of thinking about the set of problems that I have don\u2019t really change from week to week, you know. It\u2019s like, I can talk more about them, but you\u2019ve already heard about all of them, you know more or less what they are. So, sort of thinking about the feeling of nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">changing over time, which is much less the sense that I have here, but is a sense that I have in our couples\u2019 counseling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">It\u2019s like... we keep... going and following in sort of... we\u2019ll talk about problems in useful ways, and then it will sort of default back to talking about all of the problems at once in a way that\u2019s not useful at all. Like... and sort of extends backwards in time in a way that isn\u2019t very useful. So, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">it\u2019s sort of like, you know, this was a problem six months ago; isn\u2019t that helpful to dealing with whatever problems exist now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562592\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay. I am not sure that I explained it with any clarity at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">(pause 00:13:16 to 00:13:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">So sort of, we go to couples\u2019 counseling. Tanya doesn\u2019t really want to be there, because she doesn\u2019t want to... She has a hard time being upset with anyone, and she doesn\u2019t want anyone to be upset with her. (pause) I don\u2019t really want to be there, because I don\u2019t want to... One of the, one of my goals <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">for this good period in Tanya\u2019s mood is to come out of it when she collapses again with some certainty that it has nothing to do with me. And so, you know, talking about any... Talking about, you know, I\u2019m not sure that this relationship has much of a future, because I can\u2019t really figure out how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">trust you not to kill yourself. Which is not (chuckles), doesn\u2019t fit into that set of goals of mine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">So we go and we sort of sit there and we talk briefly with Dr. Jannis, and then eventually we sort of move into talking about the problems again. But as we get into talking about what\u2019s going on in our lives, we just have to talk about the same things again and again, because they don\u2019t change from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">week to week. We still have... We still make less money than we spend, which means that we continue to accrue debt and have a lot of debt. I am employed in exactly the same way from week to week, though I have been, my advisor\u2019s paying me while I look for another job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">You know, the car continues to need brake work that we can\u2019t afford, so we aren\u2019t doing ... just like... And this week, you know, steered through those relatively quickly, then we could get to the one where Tanya wants me to be more engaged with her friends at church or something. It\u2019s actually really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">not clear what she wants in this context, particularly... And this is where extending backwards into time becomes a problem, right? Because she wants something different to have happened, is the best I can make out of it, but in the last week, there is actually nothing that I should have done differently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">She had a slightly shaky week. I was kind and comforting, supportive. Sat there, we did separate things. I went to a conference, she went to a church retreat. Sunday her, one of her good friends from high school was in town, which was a surprise to us. So she came by and talked with her for a while. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">Then we had a games night with Franco. So like, then on Monday we have couples\u2019 counseling, so... (pause) But we got onto her talking about there being some problem in... I don\u2019t know... in me not wanting to be friends with her church friends or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: (pause) I imagine that didn\u2019t go over well with you, even if... internally, if not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, certainly internally. You know, I was confused as to what she was even talking about. What, because it... well, it tends to talk in a sort of more discreet fashion, at least in theory. Like, \u201cWhat has it been like this week\u201d is a question Dr. Jannis will often ask, which seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">to make sense as a like, starting point for talking about what\u2019s going on in our lives. So then in that context of like, what\u2019s going on in the last week (chuckles)... So, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562592\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: (pause) Did Tanya saying that annoy you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: (pause) It certainly perturbed me. I don\u2019t know what the right word to attach to it is. You know, it sounded annoyed or not, but I feel like I sound frustrated, I certainly feel frustrated. (pause) I think part of the frustration I feel is like... (chuckles) It\u2019s not at all clear to me what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">other incremental changes I should be making, or could possibly make, to make life okay for her, whatever the hell that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(pause 00:20:08 to 00:20:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">Not that that\u2019s specifically what she\u2019s asking, but that\u2019s what it feels like she\u2019s asking sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, are you also feeling that you\u2019ve just done enough? (pause) So much has already been asked of you, and you\u2019ve just done enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">(pause 00:21:00 to 00:21:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: So that phrase seems to imply that there is like, an end point in some ways. I feel more like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">(pause 00:21:28 to 00:21:57)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">You know, imagine you have a friend who keeps asking you for money; maybe they have a drug habit. At some point, I\u2019d say like, \u201cSeriously, I need to see you doing something with all of this money. It\u2019s not like I am growing the money in my backyard. It comes from somewhere. Like, something has to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">coming out of it, when I give it to you in order for this to be worth something.\u201d So I think, which has some of the flavor of \u201cdone enough,\u201d but doesn\u2019t have the like... Was it clear at all? This... (therapist affirms) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not a sort of, necessarily, an end point. It\u2019s a stopping point to see that something is happening with the resources you\u2019ve invested before you continue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, something like that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(pause 00:22:50 to 00:23:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems like, in addition to finances being very real, and a real problem in itself, that it\u2019s also symbolic of feeling that you guys are, your needs are outweighing your resources, and has been leading you to get into debt, sort of symbolically as well as practically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a nice... yeah... analogy. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Because ostensibly, that problem will change, to some extent at least. I imagine that whatever, I know post-docs (ph) are not wildly high-paying jobs, but I assume you\u2019re going to be more, you\u2019re going to get more than before, so (client affirms), there will be some change. That problem will <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">actually change. It might not completely go away, but it will get better, probably. So that\u2019s helpful. It certainly doesn\u2019t solve the \u201cnow,\u201d and it\u2019s also, there is also a larger issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and... Yeah, so I was thinking about all of these things, and being a very different way came to a sort of similar point, but without the nice analogies and the catharsis of saying all of those things to you. But part of the point is that some of these things are actually separable, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">they feel the same, but like the money will actually get better sometime soon. So that brings back to like you were suggesting, many weeks ago now, but like... Some decisions are time-sensitive. I don\u2019t need to find a job now, but I don\u2019t need to decide what I\u2019m doing with my relationship now, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">That reminded me of the, one of the things that physicists try to do as often as possible is, given a function of multiple variables, separate it into several functions of different variables, because you can solve functions of a single variable easily, but functions of multiple variables are ridiculously <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">difficult to solve. So, we call that separating variables, because they like to name things, strict form. So it felt very much like you were giving me the advice, \u201cWell, separate the variables!\u201d That was helpful and I think it\u2019s good advice. So that I guess I feel in some ways like that\u2019s one of keys <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">here, although you\u2019ve gone in a different direction with it in saying about these things I should feel very similar, both in the real and the metaphoric...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562592\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">(pause 00:26:05 to 00:26:31)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: What does the frustration feel like? Can you describe it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">(pause 00:26:36 to 00:27:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Probably not well. It feels like tension, it feels like there is a particular note that my voice gets when I\u2019m very frustrated. You\u2019ve recognized it, but I certainly hear it or feel it; it feels like that sound to me, which is... maybe one of the last clear things I\u2019ve said today. Today has <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">not been a particularly clear day. But maybe it feels sort of like that. You know, trying to give directions to someone who is visiting from a foreign country and doesn\u2019t speak very good English, so you can\u2019t tell where they\u2019re trying to get to, and you can\u2019t quite tell if they understand what you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">saying. It feels sort of like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">(pause 00:28:08 to 00:28:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">You know, just before you asked that, you know, I was sitting here thinking and... I feel, I don\u2019t know, tired of coming and talking about how I\u2019m upset about my relationship with my wife. I guess I\u2019ve been doing that for a while. So, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (pause) You\u2019re describing a sort of feeling of repetitiveness or almost pointlessness. And I guess among the reasons I pointed out that your financial situation will change, at least somewhat, is just simply to say there are things that are actually are changing. They\u2019re not just circling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">(client affirms) or cycling (client affirms), but they don\u2019t... But I say that, not to try to take away from your feel , I understand that\u2019s how you\u2019re feeling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Thanks. I didn\u2019t hear it either time that you said it or explained it that, like you were trying to take away from the feeling, more like you were trying to help me see beyond the feeling or something. Talk a lot about, I have this tendency to feel despair or to compare (ph), but the whole point <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">of that is that there, that feeling is overwhelming, but there are things beyond it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">(pause 00:30:40 to 00:31:28)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">You know, there are very specific drivers to some of these feelings also. I got a statement yesterday from the insurance. So because the insurance companies get to help write the laws, whenever you change any healthcare law, the fun game they\u2019re playing this time around is as a result of the institution <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">of Obamacare. They\u2019re switching all the plans from being, starting in, say, August or whenever they started to start (inaudible), which means that they get to reset all the deductibles. So they reset our deductible back to, essentially, so, which is essentially the same as just charging us more, arbitrarily. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">You know, it\u2019s perfectly legal, because they helped write the laws. So, I got that notice yesterday, that they\u2019re not paying any of what Chad is charging for April, because it goes to the deductible. So that\u2019s one piece of like, adding to the financial front. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562592\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">I went to this conference on Saturday, which was one of the strangest conferences I\u2019ve been to. They had a poster session, and there were about 20 posters up, but it was over lunch. So I was there with a guy that I\u2019ve done some work with, who was a professor and is retired now. He was giving a poster, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">but he was the only person who actually gave his poster. Everyone else just put them up, and then went and sat and ate lunch with people they already knew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">So like... (inaudible) wander around and read all the posters, but, you know, I\u2019m not going to sit down at a... There weren\u2019t actually tables on the floor with eight people who know each other that I don\u2019t know, and just start talking to them. That\u2019s just... You know, I can do that, if I prepare myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">to and feel like it\u2019s necessary, but that\u2019s not how I feel that conferences should go, particularly with this poster session. Like, the posters are the way that you meet the people who worked, right? Just like... So, that was frustrating, sort of like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">The people that I did talk with... I\u2019m there and I\u2019m clearly from Ohio, because everyone has a name tag with their name and the university. So the question is like, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Because it was a regional conference for people who are in the Denver area. So that\u2019s, you know, \u201cWife was ill and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">like...\u201d They don\u2019t really want to know that! They were curious, because it seems like maybe there would be an interesting story there, but like, \u201cOh, you know, ten seconds into knowing you now we\u2019re talking about negative things.\u201d It\u2019s sort of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">I mentioned that one of Tanya\u2019s friends from high school was here over the weekend. She\u2019s great. She\u2019s also eight month\u2019s pregnant with their second child. She and her husband are moving, where he\u2019s been hired to teach. You know, so that\u2019s sort of like, they\u2019re the same age that we are, she is. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">have two kids, and careers, and their lives aren\u2019t perfect, but relatively happy. Things are working out okay for them. So these are some other specific drivers for these feelings. At the end of the day, I, you know, clearly I am telling you what some of the causes of feeling these frustrations are. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B2\">Like, I can identify them, but that doesn\u2019t... make the frustration go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">(pause 00:35:19 to 00:35:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t love this answer, because there is more to it than that, but I was thinking, \u201cWell, why should the frustration go away? The frustration can hopefully help you solve the bigger problem.\u201d (client affirms) If you just felt less frustrated about things in your life, that were overall <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">troubling, where would the motivation be to do something about it? (client chuckles) Now does, yeah, so that\u2019s not to say that frustration is only useful, but it\u2019s also useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: (chuckling) So a couple of years ago I was talking with my friend Cody, who... We were both living in Columbus at the time and talking about some discontent with particular features of the program. He was saying, \u201cWell, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be content. Maybe you\u2019re not supposed to be content <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">in these circumstances. That\u2019s where change comes from, is people not being content with things that aren\u2019t that good.\u201d So, your advice, or your response reminded me of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562592\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s very much in line with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: There were some particular features of your phrasing that were superior to what he phrased it, because this... He didn\u2019t quite mean it, but part of what he, it sounded like he was saying, it was like, \u201cWell, maybe you should never be content, because someone\u2019s got to change things, so, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">your role is to just to be malcontent all the time,\u201d which I don\u2019t think is actually true. Yours was sort of more in response to the specific problems of... I don\u2019t... I\u2019m not happy with my life, and so the solution is not just to become okay with everything. It\u2019s to pay attention to that and make the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200852\">appropriate changes, I think, or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah, along those lines, the thought about some of the frustration... This isn\u2019t quite right, but I was just thinking that sometimes you have this feeling, when you\u2019re really in a despairing mode (which I\u2019ve seen you in), is just hearing like things are just unsalvageable. It\u2019s not unsalvageable. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">The question is, what do you want to salvage? (client chuckles) And you don\u2019t want to salvage everything. You also feel that way. So it\u2019s not unsalvageable, and it\u2019s not that you want to salvage everything. So the question is, what is the most important things for you to salvage, and then how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">(pause 00:38:16 to 00:38:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s a really interesting way of describing it. I think it\u2019s right. It\u2019s also terrifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Hmm. How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: (pause) Um, I\u2019m not exactly sure, but it\u2019s in that idea of like, you don\u2019t want to salvage everything. What are the important things to salvage? (pause) I think there is a part that is afraid of making those choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s right. Which I think leaves you just feeling like, I have just the same problems I did. You know, it\u2019s sort of a, they\u2019re related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, because in some ways, at the root of all of it, it\u2019s like, I have to make some choices about what I want to salvage and what I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t really want to make those choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: Why not? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Um... (pause) I don\u2019t know that I know, but some things that come up are fear of loss, and fear of hurting other people, and... I don\u2019t know, other than that. I feel like there is probably more to it than that, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">(pause 00:40:12 to 00:40:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">Plus I have this sense of not being able to figure out how to assess what I want, to salvage what I don\u2019t. Yeah. Or any like, metric for it. No, it\u2019s okay to want this and not want that, or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s ultimately going to change, or going to have to change for something to change, because you were saying before, the problems aren\u2019t changing (client affirms), which you know, has input, (inaudible) not entirely true. There are some problems that are changing, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Well, it started with that, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Right. But ultimately, what\u2019s going to change is what you about the problems you have. And that\u2019s a big change, what you do about them, and how you handle them differently will change those problems, and it will very much will. (client affirms) It\u2019s not, sort of, these are just the problems <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">and this is, this is, you know, what life gives you and that\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562592\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think part of the frustration comes from some of the problems, the easy problems, I know how to handle like, the money problems. There is no difficult problem there like, eventually I\u2019ll make more money and they\u2019ll go away, so... But I think you\u2019re pointing at the deeper problems, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">think that is partly right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">(pause 00:42:30 to 00:43:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">Do you have a clear sense of what needs to change or how to change it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Um... I feel like I could answer that in very specific ways and more general ways. In a very general sense, how you take ownership. I think what needs to change for you to feel better is to take more ownership over decisions in your life and feel less, \u201cThis just sucks and I, this just sucks.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A91\">Because it doesn\u2019t... That leaves you very stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">So, in a general way, that... and, which is why I asked you the question. I mean, you were addressing it, but talking about being afraid of making those choices. I think that is very much tied with this, about what\u2019s at stake about making those choices, and making those, you know, value decisions and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB1\">following through on them, whatever that might look like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">(pause) I think the \u201chow to\u201d becomes sort of just more apparent once that (client affirms) begins to happen. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be as much of a source of confusion or question. (client affirms) You know, James, we do need to stop for today, but I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Thank you for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Okay, take care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
