(chuckles) I almost would\u2019ve been late for this appointment if I I like woke up to my alarm at my normal time and I think like last night and I was like so conscious, I was like \u201cGo set your alarm for earlier\u201d and then I didn\u2019t. Then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">woke up at the normal time and like leapt out of bed (chuckles) and raced to get ready to get here. So I\u2019m glad that I did remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">It has felt like a really, really long week. So the reason I had to cancel Monday, which I meant to do on Friday and then again on Saturday and then, whatever. Then I did think it was 24 hours that you needed but (inaudible at 00:01:19). Anyway, it was because we had a full screening of the movie called <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">Cesar Chavez that is due to come out later this month. It\u2019s directed by a guy Diego Luna who is pretty well-known. He\u2019s a Mexican director so mostly Spanish language films is what he\u2019s directed [up until then]. So we were able to get a pre-release screening of the film. And then we flew in the director <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">and the producer -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: who gave a panel after [they produced the film] and it was really cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: It was a little tense because there is this professor that we had come moderate the discussion from Kennedy School named Marshall Ganz, and he apparently like was in the whole he marched and he was like part of like the work with Cesar directly and the whole thing. So we had [him come] and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">we were all a little nervous. Like is he going to, you know, do the thing where he\u2019s like \u201cThat\u2019s not at all how it was,\u201d you know. And pretty much yes, he did. Tiff [ph] my boss was moderating it and so she was like \u201cI\u2019m just going to direct questions that are very specific.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And try to so of course she asked him some lofty question about, you know, his experience and what you know, could he tell us a little bit about blah blah blah. And he goes \u201cYeah, that\u2019s wonderful. I will answer your question in a moment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: You know (chuckles) which is stupid because he [ended up ambushing them]. He said things like \u201cThis film made me very sad. This isn\u2019t at all Cesar Chavez was nothing like the cartoon that you portray him as in this film\u201d to like 180 people who all just loved the film and like undergrads <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">who were like screaming girls because Diego Luna is so handsome and the whole thing. So everybody is just like silent. It was very awkward. He goes on his own diatribe and then the rest they were very good. I mean, you could see that while he was talking, they started to get this stance of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">very defensive. They were sitting like this, legs crossed, just kind of like \u201cReally?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: \u201cTell us more.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: And they answered nicely and were kind of talking about like \u201cYeah, if we were doing a documentary, it would\u2019ve been a documentary. It was a Hollywood film, [like the Hollywood version] basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562332\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Which made complete like of course it was. And to be perfectly honest, who gives a shit? It gave me information about the whole movement that I didn\u2019t know. So it gave me a basis on which I can say \u201cWell, let me look up and see a little bit more about this.\u201d Not like I\u2019m going to, but if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I\u2019m the average viewer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Anyway. And then later, he kind of was a little bit remorseful in terms of how he was speaking about the film and saying, you know, \u201cWell, you know, I have to say, I was -\u201d And then he was like \u201cI like that you did this, and I like that you included about his fast\u201d and whatever the case is. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">Anyway, that was Monday and that was also my assistant\u2019s first day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And she\u2019s been great so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s tiring because I\u2019m training, and then I\u2019m trying to answer e-mails, and then I have all this other stuff on my plate, and I have to be an example and a role model and a you know, checking in with her all the time. And it\u2019s just very tiring and a very long week. It\u2019s made the week <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">feel very long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">We\u2019ve had events every day so far, and that will continue through tomorrow. Which is great for her to kind of just be able to dive right in and whatever. (pause) Poor Vivian [ph]. On top of all this stuff with work and how, you know, she got screwed over I told you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: And then on Friday, she gets a call from her mother in Venezuela that her aunt, her mother\u2019s only sister, has passed away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: And the passing away was the result of she went out to get ice cream in Caracas. Got robbed. This guy stole her purse and in the process of stealing her purse she\u2019s older, in her 60s she like fell over or got knocked over or something. Broke her hip. Was having surgery on her hip <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">and died in surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Oh my God. That\u2019s awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Isn\u2019t that horrible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Anyway, so poor Vivian [ph]. I mean, not only is that horrible just in and of itself, but to add insult to injury with the shitty stuff. So that was pretty horrible for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">She\u2019s recouping well. She just had her mother said \u201cNo, don\u2019t come\u201d because her mother lives like far from Caracas, so she\u2019s like \u201cNo, I\u2019m only going in for a day for the funeral.\u201d Oh and then there was some drama that they couldn\u2019t find her body -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: [Oh my God].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: because the morgue like something because it was part of a criminal investigation. Because even though the death wasn\u2019t directly related to the robbery, because she submitted a police report for the robbery and then died later -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: So they didn\u2019t know if it was at the morgue there or the police.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I see. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Horrible. And then I received a (pause) You know, I applied to a couple other jobs this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, I applied to one last week when I got to work. It had been posted on Thursday. I applied on Friday, posted on Thursday. It\u2019s in the same department that I just had that phone interview with the other woman. Did I tell you about the phone interview I had?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Okay. Well, there\u2019s an events coordinator job and I applied to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562332\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Which school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Like for MIT College.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: And I applied to it because I noticed that they were hiring from within. So like they posted the events coordinator position at the same time that they posted the assistant director for events position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: But the assistant director of events position was listed with \u201cstrong internal candidate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: And then when I called, it was because the events coordinator was getting that job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: So I applied to the events coordinator job because I was like, maybe that\u2019s the way they do it in this department.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: But then I had a phone interview with the recruiting person from that HR department and she was basically like \u201cYou\u2019re over-qualified and this job only pays $50,000 and you would have far less responsibilities\u201d and blah blah blah. \u201cBut it\u2019s good we got in contact, and I have your name and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">events team has your resume on their radar\u201d and blah blah blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">So then I applied for this other job which is a little bit more directed towards the development side of it, but it\u2019s the same department and it speaks a lot to events coordination. And it\u2019s like a manager position, so I applied to it. Then I e-mailed her like directly after and it had been posted only <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">internally the day before. It gets posted internally for two weeks and then is open to the public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: All these positions. So because I\u2019m internal, of course, I can see that it was just posted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: And she e-mails me back and says \u201cSure good to hear no problem. I know that they\u2019re at the end of their interview process, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to get your resume into the ring.\u201d So I e-mailed her back and I was like \u201cOkay, thanks so much. I\u2019m surprised to hear that they\u2019re already at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">the end of their -\u201d Like what the fuck? How am I supposed to ever get a job if they are literally just posting because they have to but they already have the person? Like how am I ever going to so I got very frustrated about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">Then I applied to some other jobs. I don\u2019t even know. Or maybe I didn\u2019t. Maybe I e-mailed (inaudible at 00:09:10) and didn\u2019t apply. Whatever. A while back though oh, I applied to one in Houston<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a senior manager of events at the business school. At the College of Business at Texas International University, which is a school that I actually had looked at for their MBA program because they have a really good like they have a really broad spectrum of MBA programs. They had one <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A51\">that concentrated on Latin America, and I was interested in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: [In my \u201cI wanted to get an MBA\u201d days].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: But this might be a good opportunity -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: To take some classes there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Exactly. Anyway and it pays and it lists the pay of like more in the range of what I make now or above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: So anyway, I applied to that. And then I applied to an assistant director of engagement events position at University of Chicago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: I was like \u201ceh\u201d, but it\u2019s the position I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: And so then I got a call for an interview. But then in reviewing the job description, I noticed that it said \u201cnormal hiring salary range.\u201d It was like 50 to like 55,600 and I make 55,100 now.

Because I think it would be interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: Because I was able to come up, just in terms of the formulas that they gave us for so, okay, it\u2019s basically part of his whole theory in how he does his workshops and the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: Bailey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s this okay, it has four columns, right? It\u2019s called he has this immunity to change theory. Like we\u2019ve built this immune system -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: [I follow].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: You know what I\u2019m saying?

I think it\u2019s not, as far as like generally part of clinical psych graduate -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: Which is should be. Or is it because it\u2019s like such a new theory?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: No, I mean, I forget why but I ran across it after graduate school at some point. So I sort of read through his books. I know like a little bit, but it was a while ago. I think basically what I remember thinking at the time was something like it was a nice way of summarizing ideas that have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201031\">been around and sort of very well-established in like [psychology\/psychotherapy].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: Like provide a nice way to introduce it to the people who are familiar with that kind of stuff. But it\u2019s not really saying anything that\u2019s new or different. It just sort of packages it very well and says it well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah, well I think it\u2019s like packaging it for like adult learners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, [like a new] audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And for businesses particularly is how they -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2010C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562332\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry, my phone is like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: It\u2019s Stephanie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. And there are other people who do like organizational development consulting and coaching who have come up with similar models. I think his is probably one of the better known.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think it\u2019s used as a basis for a lot of these career coaches also -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: is what I\u2019m finding. So anyway, there\u2019s these columns, right? And the first column is called your visible commitment. So the goal that you want to most work on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: So I came up with like one about shit, I should\u2019ve brought it. I had it in my bag and I took it out because there were too many things in my bag. I had my notebook and well, anyway, whatever. I will e-mail it to you because I do think it would be interesting. And it\u2019s about basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">how reactive I am and how that manifests (pause) and that my goal is to not like be so reactive (chuckles) and not let my emotions rule my reactions as much as I feel that they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: Or something. This is one of those classes that is harder than I really anticipated because (inaudible at 00:15:16).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">CLIENT: Right. So anyway, then the second column is called hidden commitments. No, wait. No, no, no. \u201cDo what I\u2019m doing or not doing that I\u2019m unable to reach this goal that I have. What am I doing or not doing to thwart the efforts of my visible commitment?\u201d Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess. So do you mean things like if your visible goal is to be less reactive, then things that get in the way of that are, you know, \u201cI called my mother and I\u2019m upset about this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: \u201cWhich, you know, is just the sort of situation when she says X, Y and Z and it\u2019s likely to get me reactive.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah, although I was certainly not able to be that specific with examples because I just it was just so overwhelming doing this. So I didn\u2019t I wrote like (inaudible at 00:16:20).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: Or like (pause) I should\u2019ve brought it. I don\u2019t remember. Anyway, and the third column is called hidden commitments. Well, first we had to do this worry box, which is like all of the things that I think of. Like what will happen if I do the opposite of what I\u2019m doing now. Like do the opposite <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B1\">of column two. So like I\u2019m doing all this stuff to prevent myself from doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">The worry box is what are all the scary things that come to mind. Like I won\u2019t be seen as important if I do the opposite, right? Okay, then you translate that to your hidden commitments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">CLIENT: So that you\u2019re saying okay, well wait. (pause) So the hidden commitments column is like meant to serve as like (pause) That it should feed back into the goal. So it\u2019s like an arrow. I can\u2019t even explain this right now. I don\u2019t remember. See, I can\u2019t remember stuff. I don\u2019t even remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201431\">what it is now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">And then there\u2019s a fourth column which is called see, I can\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know. I lost it. But it\u2019s made my week very difficult. (chuckles) (pause) Basically the assignment this week was to submit this list of big assumptions which is like, I assume that if I do the opposite of this hidden <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201471\">commitment that I have that\u2019s preventing me from reaching my goal or whatever, that the world will collapse. Like whatever. These are these big assumptions. And then the assignment was to create a draft test of one of these assumptions, so then we can do an experiment like where we\u2019re basically testing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201472\">the big assumption to see if it\u2019s true or false. And I got really frustrated because I was like, I can\u2019t how would I test anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20146-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20146-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562332\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">How can I test that I assume that if I don\u2019t appear to be in control that everything will fall apart? How the fuck can I test that? \u201cHey, do I appear to be in control?\u201d Like who am I asking? Like what the so I got very frustrated.

THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: And it seems like bullshit and impossible. Like what is the point of this stupid fucking ITC map with the fucking bullshit I don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re talking about? How can I test that I assume that if I don\u2019t take care of the small things, nobody will? I can\u2019t test that. If I don\u2019t take <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201511\">care of scooping the litter, my house will smell like cat shit.

I like typed up this assignment. Like \u201cI can\u2019t fucking test any of this because you\u2019re fucking assholes.\u201d I did say that. But I was basically like, \u201cI can\u2019t test any of this. I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s all very sad. This is all intangible, introspective shit that I\u2019ve written and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201591\">there\u2019s no way to test any of it, so what the fuck are you talking about?\u201d That was my question.

In this case, you know, Kevin Bailey.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2017C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562332\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: So I guess I\u2019m trying to be a little bit cute about this because that right there probably lays out what goes in the different boxes and the model. So your sort of like I forget like visible commitment -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: is to being less reactive.

(pause) In a way, what you\u2019re doing here all the time is sort of, without sort of exactly intending and planning this in advance or setting out to do this, testing yourself in way with me to see if that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F1\">what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">In other words, like we can look at it and see oh, there\u2019s something that made you anxious and that\u2019s why you forgot. I could be wrong, but I suspect the way I\u2019m responding to you is not making you feel ashamed. But like I hope is sort of helping to contextualize why you might have had trouble remembering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: Not because you\u2019re an idiot or because there\u2019s something emotional going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: And I think that\u2019s the test they\u2019re referring to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">CLIENT: Kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">THERAPIST: If we\u2019re sitting here talking this out, your assumption is that if you can\u2019t remember, you\u2019re an idiot and I\u2019m thinking critically of you and you\u2019re going to get shamed, either by me or by you or by both of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">So you\u2019ve got to do something about that which is to sort of turn the spotlight over to Bailey and talk about what a disappointing asshole he is. But the experiment is sort of like well, wait a minute, if you have trouble remembering, does that really make you incompetent and vulnerable to being shamed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A71\">or likely to be shamed and criticized?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: But who am I asking? Like who is telling me that\u2019s true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Well, I think it\u2019s kind of implicit here between you and me. I think in a way you expect me to do that or you expect to do it to yourself as you\u2019re sitting here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">CLIENT: (pause) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(pause) Yeah, I think his version of it would be something like, see what happens if you have trouble doing the sort of thing that would make you feel like an idiot. Like, you know, sort of try to stay with that a little bit instead of leaping away from it and pointing a finger <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B51\">at somebody else. Stay with it and see what happens. You know, does everybody jump down your throat? You know, like are you inevitably viewed as incapable and sort of shamed for it? Or like does another explanation for why you have trouble emerge?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562332\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">Or, you know, do you come to understand in a different way why it was difficult for you in a way that\u2019s more sympathetic.

I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Be attached to those instincts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">THERAPIST: I see. So here we go with round two of what\u2019s probably the same thing, right? Where problem number one was not being able to remember and feeling ashamed about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">And problem number two is being too attached to your instincts and unable to deal with this. And that also is shameful and makes you feel incompetent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) But there\u2019s nobody else to blame but myself for that. So that I\u2019m not I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m running away from or like pointing fingers or whatever. I mean, if I had to, I guess I could blame my father. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Well, or me (chuckles) in that (pause) I mean, I think as you said in a way, like this is something I\u2019m supposed to be helping you with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">CLIENT: Right. But I understand therapy and so I\u2019m not you know what I mean? Like I\u2019m not my instinct isn\u2019t to be like \u201cWell, what the fuck, like I\u2019m not fixed?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Well, but, I guess you know, therapy involves both, right? It involves saying yes at one sort of level maybe logically or conceptually like \u201cSure, I can\u2019t entirely blame this on Ethan as much as I might like to.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: But at another level, that feeling of wanting to or knowing that at some level, you do even if it\u2019s not entirely fair. You know, that\u2019s also part of therapy, I think. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: You know, and that is sort of and the reason it is, is because that points back to the way that is more comfortable to deal with it which is to say like the other person is disappointing. (pause) You\u2019re not doing that for no reason. You\u2019re doing that because you don\u2019t want to feel so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF1\">disappointing. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.

But also I\u2019m tempted not to because I feel like it could help me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">But then I think I like preemptively just feel like I\u2019ve already failed and it won\u2019t change anything, and that I\u2019m so stuck in my ways and stubborn or whatever that I\u2019m not going to change anyway. So I may as well just quit now so that later I don\u2019t have to feel more disappointed in myself. Like in <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB1\">my brain, there\u2019s no option of coming out with like \u201cHa ha ha. Oh, I feel so much better in working on all this stuff and therapy is so much better\u201d and da da da.

Like I choose to stay I choose to stay and not try to move, and then it\u2019s the fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020F1\">coldest winter we\u2019ve had in years and the third warmest on record in Houston. And then I could\u2019ve fucking come back by now if I really hated it there. But no, I decided to fucking stay and then I made a horrible decision with this fucking disgusting roommate. And then the cats were a bad decision, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020F2\">Franklin [ph] was a bad decision, and the abortion was a bad decision, and not fucking applying to that other job was a bad decision, and not taking that job like that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been feeling this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20211\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20213\">Like everything has been a bad decision, and I want to go back five years and change all of the decisions I\u2019ve made and see what happens. I\u2019m just feeling like I can never how am I ever going to make a right decision when I keep making all these wrong decisions? (pause) And how do I reconcile those <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202131\">feelings with the fact that time machines don\u2019t exist? (pause) Everything, bad decision.
