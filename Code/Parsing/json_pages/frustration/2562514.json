Things are the same. I closed my Match.com profile. Did you know that? It was ridiculous. I\u2019m certainly not dealing with my father this weekend. That was a fail. For some reason, I told my brother. I said, yeah. Like, he told me that he took a DVD player from my mom\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">house that doesn\u2019t work. So if I had one. And I said, yes, to giving him my DVD player that\u2019s in my bedroom that I haven\u2019t used since I moved in and that\u2019s like, for a while or whatever. So maybe that\u2019s what just like probably going to be like, sure. But then I was like, wait a second. Why should <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">he get my DVD player? Because I felt bad. Oh, poor Michael, no TV or whatever. I mean, I\u2019m giving him my computer, my old one. I have to clean it off and get it ready for him which I\u2019ve been telling him for two weeks I\u2019m going to do. So maybe I\u2019ll actually do it this weekend. But then, why should he <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">get my DVD player? [1:34] I felt like he knew I would say that or something. I don\u2019t know. All my life it\u2019s poor Michael. Poor Michael. Like, oh, Michael.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re a little different today. When you talk about this stuff that\u2019s clearly not happy stuff, but you don\u2019t seem as frustrated or bothered by it or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Because I feel \u2013 what\u2019s the word?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Resigned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yes. Thank you. That\u2019s the feeling that I\u2019m having towards the world today. [2:45] Every single day this week I have not wanted to go in like, in a big way. I don\u2019t want to deal with any of the people. I don\u2019t want to do anything. And then Glenda (sp) is away for two or three weeks, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">her daughter is having twins, and so she went to Washington State. And so as of right now, she\u2019ll be back next week, though. (pause) [3:38] Like, what should I be doing? It\u2019s the same fucking feeling that I\u2019ve been having for years now, it seems like. Like what do I do? Okay, I\u2019ll work out. Like, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">same thing that you\u2019ve heard me say before. Oh, I\u2019ll work out. I\u2019ll do Salsa classes. I\u2019ll take a class. I\u2019ll do whatever. [4:37] (pause) [5:38] You know, I\u2019m still wishing that somebody like you could tell me what to do. Like, or anyone. But I guess you end up feeling like the most -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: likely candidate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes. To be able to tell me something useful. Because everybody else is probably going to tell me the same shit, and also that everybody has problems and to whatever. [6:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Something seems different today.

[7:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s really interesting. Like, what are you sensing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: You seem different a bit, maybe. .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Well, because something did happen this week, but I purposely. Like, I was on the phone with Stephanie this morning like, talking about it. And I purposely said, I don\u2019t want to talk about that with Ethan today, because I don\u2019t want to waste the hour. And she\u2019s like no, I totally get it. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">you would rather wait to talk about it at a later point when it\u2019s not so fresh in your mind. Because, I\u2019ll tell you what happened. But now it\u2019s going to waste time. But anyway, it\u2019s fine. But I don\u2019t think that it has anything to do with my attitude \u2013 I don\u2019t know, maybe it does. Maybe you can tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">me. Okay, so there\u2019s \u2013 Okay, wait. So, I\u2019ll tell you the story. [8:38] So there\u2019s this guy that I was talking to on Match right before I closed it. This British guy that goes to (inaudible at 8:44) at Match.com. And I wasn\u2019t that attracted, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562514\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">I ended up going out with him on \u2013 like, I was out having drinks at this private bar that\u2019s there near my house, actually. And so he\u2019s like, oh, why don\u2019t you come blah, blah, blah and we can meet. And so I did. And then, we hung out again on Tuesday night. And we went out for dinner and whatever. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">then I ended up sleeping with him. And it was okay. It was fine, whatever. I was like eh, maybe not so soon. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. But whatever. Like, he was nice. He was putting in lots of attention. We were texting all the time. Like, we had been for a few weeks already. So \u2013 and he wanted me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">to sleep over, but I didn\u2019t. And then, we hung out again last night and he slept over at my house. And I was so annoyed by him. The whole night, almost entirely. And then he snored. So I didn\u2019t sleep good. I slept horribly. I have zero tolerance with snoring, kind of. [9:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Loud snoring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Ugh. Remember I had to take sleeping pills? For Christ\u2019s sake. I can\u2019t \u2013 I woke up like 1,000 times. I even moved to the couch for an hour. And then it would stop and then it would start again. It was not good. And then he annoyed the fucking shit out of me this morning. He was like \u2013 he asked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">\u2013 I was up and about doing my thing, whatever. He\u2019s like, firing up his laptop. He had brought his laptop, he was doing some work. Whatever. Like, still in the bed. [10:18] And I was, you want some coffee? He\u2019s like, oh, tea. Like, obviously. I\u2019m like, I have mint tea. I don\u2019t have \u2013 that\u2019s as good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">as you get. I gave him his fucking tea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">Then, he was like well, what do you have to eat? And I was like, I have some cinnamon toast or I have some cereal. He\u2019s like, what kind of cereal? Meanwhile, I\u2019m like, running around, getting dressed. Doing whatever I\u2019m doing. Then he\u2019s like, no, I\u2019m good. Then he\u2019s like, do you have any bananas? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">I was like, no. I\u2019m allergic to fruit. I don\u2019t have any in the house. And then he\u2019s like, no, I\u2019m good. Then he\u2019s like still, whatever. And I\u2019m kind of, we have to leave by X time. If I was going to drop him back where he\u2019s living right there and then come here. And I was like, I can\u2019t be late. I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">to be in the square at 8:30. I should \u2013 And then he was like, actually, yeah, can I have some toast? And I was like, okay, sure. And I put it in the thing, got out some butter and stuff and a plate or whatever. And doing whatever I was doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">And I was like Ken, you know, that toast is about done if you could, you know, go make it yourself or whatever. He\u2019s like, five minutes later, what about the toast? And I like, oh, my God, are you kidding me? And like, ran and like hastily slapped butter on the fucking thing and wanted to like, throw <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">it throw it in his face, precipitated by the evening prior where we had decided to order pizza. And he was like, being really annoying. Like, more pizza, please. Like, I don\u2019t know. Get it yourself. I don\u2019t know. It really annoyed the fucking shit out of me. And it was like \u2013 I was able to accept last <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">night aside, but then this morning like, dude. And I didn\u2019t even have time to make the bed. I left later than I wanted to, because I had wanted to grab something maybe myself, because I don\u2019t usually eat at home, because I\u2019m like out the door or whatever. And then I crawl back in bed. Is that a failed experiment?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562514\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">I was like, what a failed experiment. Because I had been telling her like, well, maybe it\u2019s good. Maybe we\u2019ll start dating, because he was being nice to me. Attentive. Whatever. And she was like, well, it\u2019s not failed. It was just an experiment. It just didn\u2019t yield the results that you were hoping <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">for. I was like, but I don\u2019t have to see him again, do I? She\u2019s like, no. She\u2019s like, that\u2019s what dating is, right? [12:56] I was like, I have no idea. Like he really annoyed the shit out of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">Oh, and on top of that, he kept on saying that my pets weren\u2019t very well behaved. And I was like oh, no. You don\u2019t go there. He\u2019s like, my mother\u2019s cat is much better behaved than yours. And I was like, I don\u2019t give a shit who the fuck your mother\u2019s cat is. Fuck your mother\u2019s cat. Like, because he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">talking \u2013 they were like, in the bathroom and they were everywhere in the house. I was like, they live here. Do you understand this? So that \u2013 the cat thing is a thing for me. Also, Maka (ph) didn\u2019t jump up on him to cuddle with him. She likes guys that I like and that are good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: She has good taste.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: She does. She\u2019s keen like that. And she did not try to get cuddly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: That is a sign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. And she did a little bit in the middle of the night, but he was kicking her off, so then, she would come more to me. But while we were hanging out watching TV and stuff, she was nowhere to be seen. And I\u2019m sorry, but I trust the cats in this way. I mean, I trust myself, too. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">also, the cats, you know, weren\u2019t into it. [14:20] So maybe that \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Now that that\u2019s the thing that like, I wasn\u2019t going to explain, because I don\u2019t want to waste time on it. But I was so annoyed by it this morning that I was just \u2013 I didn\u2019t even want to talk about it right now. I was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">to let it settle and not be annoyed by the whole situation. Like at least Sergio, when he sleeps over. Like, by the time I\u2019m up and doing my thing, he\u2019s out the door. Gone. Because he has to go to work or whatever. Good. Like, get out kind of. I mean, you know. If you\u2019re not going to be up like, helping <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B3\">me with shit while I\u2019m also getting ready -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Right. Don\u2019t get in my way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Or, you don\u2019t live here. If you live here, it\u2019s a different story. Do whatever you want. If you\u2019re going to stay here and leave with me or whatever. When you\u2019re a guest in my home and I\u2019m serving you? What the fuck? It wasn\u2019t ideal for me. So anyway, do you feel like that\u2019s affected \u2013 Is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Even in saying it, you sound annoyed and I believe he annoyed the shit out of you this morning and maybe some last night, too. Although it sounds like you, as you said, you were able to put that aside. You don\u2019t sound as frustrated by it or that you have that same edge <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">that you sometimes do. [15:40] I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. But maybe that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not sure. I mean, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562514\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: \u2018Cause like \u2013 and also, that was the last little Match.com endeavor that I was going to do for a while. Again, I think the resigned feeling was lending to my attitude towards things right now. Like, fuck it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: It would be a waste of time because you ran because you felt like that was a waste of time in the first place? And so, to talk about it would be wasting more time on it than you already have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Correct. I mean, I think that what\u2019s good \u2013 what I want to recognize in myself in this situation is that I am able \u2013 I was able to see very quickly that this is not a guy that would work for me. And I\u2019m not, you know, taking the attention as like, well, maybe I should still give it a chance. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">I\u2019m kind of just like, nope. Next. Or, nobody. Like, whatever. [17:01] So that bit I feel good about. And I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 So I have British relatives and I went last year for the bar mitzvah or whatever. And, you know, my cousin, Kaylie, who\u2019s my age. She visited us in the US when we were maybe, God. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">I lived on Clifton Road, still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">So we were maybe like, 10, 12 or something. And my mother and I were so fucking annoyed by her. And it was so interesting, because I was like, oh, my God, I\u2019m getting annoyed in the same way like, maybe it\u2019s a British like, the way that they say things. The way that they say things or something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">it. Because it was a very similar feeling. Because by the time Kaylie left, my mom and I were like, ah, thank God. You\u2019re so annoying. Asking for things all the time and just, we always found her annoying for some reason. Like, that maybe they\u2019re deserving or something. They feel like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Like, entitled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Entitled. Right. Like, why isn\u2019t breakfast out when I come down. Like, I have to get juice myself? What do you mean? [18:31] When like, for my mother it was like, you\u2019ll eat when we eat, you know. And I felt like, no, you\u2019re trying to date me and be in my house. Feel free. Make yourself at home. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">So anyway, that was interesting, too. And I noticed that last night that he was like Kaylie. (pause) And I think the other thing maybe you\u2019re sensing is that right now, I just want to fucking get through the day, do my fucking work, babysit Rose and like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m just most looking forward to going tomorrow afternoon and going to get manicures with Stephanie and hanging out and going to a nice dinner together. And then going to my mom\u2019s, watching my lecture, doing some laundry. Like, even though that stuff is kind of boring, not really the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">same. I\u2019m most looking forward to that. And then hopefully Sunday I\u2019ll just be able to do nothing, because I\u2019m all caught up with work or whatever. I\u2019ll just have the day to myself or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: You know, the other thing I\u2019m hearing too, somewhat is that you want to coast a bit today. Like, enough with the stuff that\u2019s upsetting. It feels like a struggle. [21:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: And also, because I have so much to do at work.

I think the rest of the day is going to be kind of harried. (pause) [22:29] I wanted to call out sick from work today.

I mean, I could do stuff from home, some of it, but It\u2019s just easier to just -. At work, I\u2019m feeling that this week has been hard to feel like supervising and training and being a good example and responsible and stuff. [23:55] I don\u2019t want to babysit today. But I think that (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">at 24:10] good, you know, and she\u2019ll go to bed and so it\u2019s like, whatever. I should have brought my laptop along.

And then I had the thought that I only want to hang out with Stephanie. I haven\u2019t seen her in a couple weeks. And I think it\u2019s just been so stressful <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">with work and school stuff that I feel it would be comforting.

But I find it really hard. I\u2019m having one of those phases where I\u2019m finding it really hard to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">it, because I\u2019m just bored of it all. I\u2019m sick of doing the same thing and talking to the same people. [27:07] And so I\u2019m having one of those weeks, and so I\u2019m dreading going to work now, because I\u2019m nervous about being able to get all of this stuff done that I feel I\u2019d like to get done. And now I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">also feeling like I\u2019m dreading babysitting, \u2018cause I\u2019d rather just go home.

And I\u2019m also tired. I don\u2019t even care if I\u2019d go home and go to sleep at 7:00. That would be fine. (pause) [29:36] I still have to get this application in.

I don\u2019t really know how the process works. We\u2019ll see.
