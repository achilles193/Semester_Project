But I was just like, \u201cNot right now.\u201d I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know. Then there\u2019s like this other tech who like\u2014I don\u2019t know. He does like a lot of the ordering for like things that we go through a lot. Like I don\u2019t know. Tips and tubes and stuff like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">I don\u2019t know. He told me that he doesn\u2019t like to talk to like reps or like he has this (inaudible) deal with this (inaudible) not coming in. So, it was like me talking to the reps. And me (inaudible) to like the loading dock in our building. It\u2019s just like I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t you deal <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">with it, so it\u2019s\u2014because it\u2019s your order? So, things like that on top of\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:23:44 00:24:14) I guess maybe hear from you I\u2019m a little confused. (pause 00:24:16 00:24:18) As you\u2019re saying it, you sound to me frustrated that (pause 00:24:24 00:24:26) these people either aren\u2019t just dealing with their own crap but instead are putting it on you. Or, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">know, like with Howard that he couldn\u2019t see that you were busy and put it on somebody else. (pause 00:24:40 00:24:45) So, I think I get the sort of in this case like frustration and also kind of the stressful part of it. But you\u2019re also saying that you have another worry which is how you come across <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">in the midst of all of this I think. (pause 00:25:00 00:25:05) And I guess\u2014(pause 00:25:05 00:25:11) I\u2019m assuming that it\u2019s like the\u2014other things that we\u2019ve talked about where you sort of worry. You get sometimes really frustrated. And you sort of worry about how you react or, you know, being sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200473\">of too critical or something. But I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: (pause 00:25:36 00:25:50) I mean (inaudible) don\u2019t want to put them in a (inaudible) of people. (pause 00:26:00 00:26:08) It just makes me want to just, you know, not protect anyone. Just, you know, hide and do what I need to do. And I don\u2019t know. (pause 00:26:16 00:26:21) I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">if I\u2019m talking to someone I\u2019m interrupting something or they\u2019re distracting what I need to do. (pause 00:26:28 00:26:39) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:26:40 00:26:57) And I\u2014(inaudible) I get that I can see why you\u2019d want to hide if anybody you talk to is likely to shower you with new and annoying things to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Or\u2014I mean they\u2019re not even just the give me things to do. They\u2019re giving me things to worry about like how I\u2019m coming across or if I\u2019m like curt to them it\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to like do things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) said the interaction itself is another thing to deal with in addition to what they might give you to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:27:40 00:28:18) That\u2019s also a reason to just stay away from everybody. (pause 00:28:21 00:29:46) And then that\u2019s a part where you\u2014that\u2019s something that you start to feel is more kind of on you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:29:54 00:30:33) And I guess as though if you were\u2014or more stable or less reactive or better in some fashion then (pause 00:30:46 00:30:50) you wouldn\u2019t worry or be stressed out by the interactions themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: (pause 00:30:56 00:31:49) I guess just feel (inaudible)\u2014(pause 00:31:50 00:31:59) I don\u2019t know.

I might\u2014my impression is that you start to feel pretty trapped when you talk about something like this. And like (pause 00:34:34 00:34:38) it\u2019s this inherent problem with you that (pause 00:34:42 00:34:47) maybe nobody can really do anything about. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">(pause 00:34:52 00:34:57) so the best thing to do is sort of keep it under the rug.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: (pause 00:34:59 00:35:27) I don\u2019t know.

(inaudible) (pause 00:35:52 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">00:36:07) You know, it\u2019s like if this bothers me so much then just don\u2019t even react that way or don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know. (pause 00:36:12 00:36:19) Or just kind of suck it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:36:20 00:36:40) I think there\u2019s a way that when you feel trapped in something like this the other person almost feels kind of inert. I\u2019m thinking of, you know, both at work. (pause 00:37:00 00:37:06) You know, how the other person sort of, you know, maybe piling X, Y, or Z on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">you and you\u2019re getting frustrated. And then you\u2019re getting worried about that. It\u2019s kind of like\u2014(pause 00:37:19 00:37:29) I mean it feels to you like anything you put back on the other person that isn\u2019t really quite calm and reasonable (pause 00:37:36 00:37:43) really reflects quite badly on you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200672\">(pause 00:37:45 00:37:50) But is it\u2014that it\u2019s sort of a one way street. (pause 00:37:53 00:38:03) And also it\u2019s a little like that here. I think when you get kind of\u2014or when you feel wound up in something like this, (pause 00:38:10 00:38:14) I think that feels\u2014you know, kind of a foregone conclusion <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200673\">that (pause 00:38:20 00:38:36) there\u2019s nothing I can do or a way that I can\u2019t even kind of get into this really with you.
