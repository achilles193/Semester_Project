It\u2019s probably just a matter of familiarity. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">Sometimes she\u2019ll hand him off to me and I\u2019m very good at calming him which is a surprise to me at some level, I think, but very unexpectedly gratifying. At any rate, I was thinking about our last conversation and as I recall, you remember, you can correct me if I\u2019m conflating something but I think when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">the bell rang I had said something to the effect that we were talking about my poor memory for failure to call to mind at the very least this explanation or narrative or model for what makes it hard to \u2013 I\u2019m not even sure what the malady is at this point, but what makes it hard to do things, what has <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">made it hard to identify the malady. I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I bet that makes you shut down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: That makes me shut down. Okay. What the trigger is. I guess the premise is there\u2019s this trigger that\u2019s specific and identifiable. So you were wondering why I was presenting all of these alternative understandings of the trigger in our conversation and I think that had led you to wonder a bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">about what makes it difficult to remember it. And I thought that also what made it difficult to remember and also why I kind of displaced it onto you. Maybe that was the point of entry. And I thought that that might have something to do with feeling put upon by these stories that my reluctance to own, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">partner-share and or to imagine a partnership producing this story that we\u2019ve come up with has something to do with my sense of caution or suspicion of the narratives that I\u2019ve been handed. I think that\u2019s where we left things. Do you remember it differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: No. No. Could you just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (Unclear) my dad and all these \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: All these grand schemes, a juxtaposition of very different kind of world views and all that stuff that we\u2019ve kind of strategically, I think, mutually agreed to not dwell on a little bit. At least that\u2019s my sense (unclear). You had said at one point, and Jennie, has said this before that one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">of the features of Jeffrey (sp?) is kind of insistence on these narratives, on kind of the trajectory from one place to the other. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m conflating two conversations but my impression has been that where you, we, it is a little bit suspicious of that hauling out these tropes \u2013 these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">kind of story tropes. At any rate, my thought was though that there was some kind of relationship between my caution or wariness about putting my own stamp of authority on this joint project of ours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Maybe the narrative feels like a foreign body or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Whatever. I mean what it feels like is a little unclear to me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a level of consciousness that I\u2019m approaching with this (unclear).

I like to walk over whenever I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562000\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Think about stuff. And the thought that I had was \u2013 or memory this hat I had was of interactions with my dad, particularly when I was in college and you know, I would reach this state of shut down and I\u2019d call and he\u2019d come down and I\u2019d end up being able to ride it out ride \u2013 write it out \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">ride it out \u2013 and you know at first, and I think that when I had thought about this, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019d thought about this, my understanding had always been that it was something like this interaction with Grayson. You know, there\u2019s this parental function of soothing that into ones 20s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">I\u2019d felt a little \u2013 I\u2019d felt some misgivings about in retrospect and the difficulty that I had sort of achieving that space on my own after he died seems to confirm my concern about relying too much on this function of (unclear). [0:08:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: So I guess this is how I\u2019d always understood it and I guess the thought that popped into my head as I juxtaposed those conversations was that you know, obviously, there was some of that going on but it was also like I had called a friend for a life line. I\u2019d kind of called for a rejuvenation <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">of the narrative. It was a little bit more ambiguous, a little bit darker model, explanation, for these interactions I had had with my father as if I was in the process of doing something that really wasn\u2019t for myself that I didn\u2019t want to do that I felt roped into doing and in order to sustain myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">on that path I needed to be refreshed in my memory of what was going on by these interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Wait. I think I\u2019ve lost you a little bit there on the last part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I couldn\u2019t remember the project. I couldn\u2019t remember the narrative because it didn\u2019t really belong to me. I didn\u2019t have it in my mind and it was very easy for me to forget it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I mean I get it that \u2013 I thought (unclear) when you were talking about when he would soothe you. [0:10:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And you with Grayson and about how after he died, sort of the way he was no longer there for you, perhaps made you skeptical about relying on people to soothe you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Is that part of the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Well, that was scenario one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Okay. And then the thing that you\u2019re producing darker was like, oh my God, maybe a bit of a set up yesterday where you were \u2013 maybe not what you meant?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: What was a set up yesterday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Where you kind of came in sort of needing me to like refresh the narrative for \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Two days ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, two days ago, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I hadn\u2019t made that that week but \u2013 I think this is interpretation or narrative, you know, the same interactions and the same kind of relations. It\u2019s less about soothing a child and more about telling them the story that you want to kind of guide them. It\u2019s more instrumental.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: In that one implication of that particular narrative is that there was a good reason why I couldn\u2019t remember exactly what I was doing in these moments when I kind of would collapse \u2013 why I would collapse because I was being roped in, I felt at some level, to doing something that I didn\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">to and it was as if \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Whatever I needed, another session with my control in order to resolve refreshed<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Where you\u2019re working on a project and you sort of collapse about it and you don\u2019t remember why you\u2019re doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562000\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Why I\u2019m doing it or where I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: But you can (unclear) but it wasn\u2019t really necessarily your motivation.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019d put it exactly like that but (Pause). And you know, I think that that might explain a little bit better why \u2013 at least the procession of that going on, would certainly explain why I\u2019m leery of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m smiling because something just occurred to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Which is the \u2013 I\u2019m teasing you a little bit now. No, I think I\u2019m having a little bit of trouble now because what you\u2019re describing is essentially very much in keeping with \u201cmy narrative\u201d. In other words \u2013 and the thing I\u2019m laughing about or finding like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t have a problem with \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Funny. Like I don\u2019t mean to be (unclear) \u2013 is like that seems reassuring to me is that it is actually your narrative. You know. In other words, when you say part of why I may have trouble remembering your narrative, is kind of a throwback to what happened with my dad. It could feel that way <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">to me, Galen. Where I kind of can\u2019t, I don\u2019t trust the project from the beginning and who it\u2019s really for so I kind of need to \u2013 I mean that\u2019s what happens with you every time you collapsed. In other words, not just between you and me but when you have trouble writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Agreed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Oh no, no, no. I mean I don\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You saw it that way too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. This was not a \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I think you were talking about \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: The proposition forward in the interest of defending this space and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: I thought you were sort of referring more specifically to the part about forgetting or like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I was trying to understand. I was struck by your question or sort of dilemma that you posed, you know, the problem of the extra-modularly model, what it might be that makes it difficult to have the model, the collaborative model in mind at the moment when it would be particularly useful and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">it occurred to me that the same kind of parental interactions that on the face of it seem very just almost by definition, benign, can also take on a more difficult, more troubled interpretation and the same is true of our interactions which are not parental. They are other but it\u2019s in theory at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200752\">also a nurturing relationship. So, you know, there is a tension between these two kinds of scenarios.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right. And I think what I\u2019m saying is what you\u2019re referring to now as the extra-modularly part, I think is actually pretty much the same as the model itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: You had said that you don\u2019t understand why I forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And the thing you forget is why when something goes wrong, with the relationship at work or in some sense in the household, you kind of shut down and you are done with whatever the project is that you\u2019re supposed to be working on, or you can\u2019t get started. That sounds a lot like what you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">talking about now as being extra-modularly. All I\u2019m saying is, the thing that you\u2019re \u2013 it makes a lot of sense to me \u2013 the thing that you\u2019re talking about happening here and between us and that\u2019s kind of a throwback to stuff between you and your dad, I think is the exact same thing we\u2019re talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B2\">happening in the workplace, with you and Jennie, in a way or whatever the context is where there is trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562000\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Well, the way that you formulated it most recently \u2013 you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Me. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Is in terms of providing home or space for operation. Some kind of room. You expressed it in spatial terms and this seems like a rather different concern. In other words, by definition, an institutional space just to take that particular kind of relationship, is something that is imposed on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">you by some outside authority. You\u2019re accepting a nomination, you\u2019re accepting an appointment from an institution that is allowing you into its story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I (unclear) for me with your dad would be that he actually made a space for you where the point is to work like \u2013 okay, let me back up. So with the institution making the space like that, in a way it seems like it\u2019s a joint project where both you and the institution appreciate <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">that it\u2019s for both of your benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s for my benefit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: I think it depends on how things go. When there\u2019s trouble that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I mean it seems very much the same for me with your dad. Maybe I have this wrong. Maybe I\u2019ve over generalized things. But what I have in mind is like when you collapse and you say, \u2018oh my God, this project really isn\u2019t for me,\u2019 that\u2019s very much the same as, \u2018oh my gosh, this really isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">about me at all. I don\u2019t really have a place here.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: True. So what? So you\u2019re saying that \u2013 I see. Okay.

I wasn\u2019t there. You thought of it. You suggested it. You remembered your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t have an investment in this not being \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Sometimes you do have an investment \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: You\u2019re sense of trying here is a little misplaced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t feel triumphant.

As I said, just, I don\u2019t know, 120 seconds ago \u2013 it\u2019s our joint project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I know you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: I wouldn\u2019t be doing this for so long if I didn\u2019t believe that, obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right, but you also wouldn\u2019t be doing this so long if you didn\u2019t believe in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: (Heavy sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: In other words, when there\u2019s a problem that is the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s also true. That\u2019s also true. Right. So there\u2019s this weird tension in the therapeutic relationship \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Intrinsically between \u2018I want something from you. I want you to give me something,\u2019 and the reality that if you\u2019re going to do anything productive in this particular psychic space it needs to be very collaborative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s one. And there is an analogous, historical tension in my relationship with my father that has recrudesced in all of these different settings in a way that has been extremely debilitating between a need for something from someone and my real countervailing or reciprocal need to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">something that\u2019s my own so that I can own it and feel as if I belong to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562000\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s very much how it seems to look in reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: So, okay, so there\u2019s no extra-modularly model. There\u2019s no questions I need you to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: (Unclear). Okay. I mean (heavy sigh).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">(Pause): [0:24:27 0:24:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Jennie said something very smart to me this afternoon as I was having one of these moments. She said that in a transitional phase like this the most difficult thing and the most important thing is just to kind of consciously and by an act of \u2013 she put it much more elegantly and directly \u2013 basically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">to own whatever it is you\u2019re doing so if I want to produce these manuscripts then I should be for this period at least, a writer. And that part of the difficulty that I\u2019ve been having sort of organizing myself in that direction might be alleviated by commitment to needing something or doing something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">(Pause): [0:25:47 0:26:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Which is another way of saying that one way out of this dilemma is to see if I can rely on myself to see if I have resources of my own for defining the space and the terms of operation and production. I think I fear that I can\u2019t. And so I\u2019ve gravitated toward all these very high powered institutions <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">and then been unsatisfied by them because they\u2019re frequently not gratifying in the way that they kind of validate my sense of belonging. You have a look you get when we come to the end of the hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Oh. No. I mean, we\u2019re not close to the end of the hour. The thought that was occurring to me was (Pause) I wonder if you miss having your dad do it for you as much as that was problematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. No. I\u2019m very aware of missing my father doing it for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: I think the thought was kind of like, you say you worry about being able to do it yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: But I wonder if that\u2019s partly like not wanting to do it yourself because he\u2019s supposed to be here doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Well, you know the more I have understood our relationship and his life and his agenda, the more troubled the thought of being enfolded in this particular embrace becomes. And so I become more mature and I understand the relationship and what it meant for both of us a bit better, but sure, at <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">some level I kind of, I never really found it. I never really allowed myself to find it. I mean part of what I think I\u2019ve been shedding over the last couple of years is a network of relationships that were really formed in the crucible of my just being feeling completely bereft of that direction or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D12\">definition when I \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what I meant earlier when I said I would call Evan and he would supply the narrative by that space or definition and it\u2019s very double-edged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: And maybe in a way, the sort of tension you describe between you and me, in other words like the way some of this played out has to do with you looking for the way that you and I can feel like we\u2019re working collaboratively without \u2013 and that part can feel nice without your having to be as <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">wary or concerned about it being my project or operating more in my own interest as you sometimes worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: No, I mean, yeah, explicitly, that\u2019s what was in my head when the thought came to mind. I think my sense is that I think I express this in almost all of my relationships so it has become, or has always been a very primary way of relating to people. Sometimes the tension feels more urgent than <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">others. But yeah, and I mean I guess this is a theme that is something that I\u2019m very attuned to at various levels of consciousness I guess. There\u2019s a kind of basic balance in all human interactions so it\u2019s not that exceptional that it should come up in any of these relationships. You always have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D52\">kind of mediate between these two polarities \u2013 things that you ask for and things that you kind of bring into being. In corporations, somebody \u2013 any relationship has a tension between those two things. But I\u2019m so attuned to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562000\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m so attuned to it in ways that I think are unusually and unnecessarily painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">(Pause): [0:31:48 \u2013 0:33:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Here\u2019s what I was thinking through that what\u2019s striking in a way it felt like you were like in a way so far behind where we had been on Tuesday in the sense that like the model was gone and today it feels like you\u2019re ahead, like the things I\u2019m saying in some ways seem new to me or newish, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">or, \u2018oh, that\u2019s what I meant,\u2019 or, \u2018I understand it.\u2019 And clearly you do. And it\u2019s like where it was gone Tuesday, you\u2019re thoroughly versed in it today and so I\u2019m wondering when that happened. And a part of it is you\u2019re (unclear) to think about things. But I think there\u2019s more. I don\u2019t know if it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD2\">\u2013 and part of it also is having this sort of memory or association to your dad calming you down. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s like you never remembered that before but the way you kind of connected it up and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">(Pause): [0:35:08 0:35:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And it reminds me a little bit of like sort of the magic switch we\u2019ve seen happen sometimes where the other person reaches out and that\u2019s usually what causes it. But, I don\u2019t know. Maybe there\u2019s probably more to that than at least I\u2019ve understood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">(Pause): [0:35:53 0:36:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: I mean all that I can, assuming that what you say is indeed true that there\u2019s something that was functional in our conversation today that was not functional in our conversation on Tuesday and I\u2019m not sure I totally endorse that but let\u2019s just run with it. All I can see is there was a good narrative <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E51\">that kind of helped us tease it out, a kind of framework for talking about it that allowed us to make it clear. It\u2019s like an epigram or something, an anecdote that you tell at the beginning of the chapter that allows you to make things that were abstract more particular, more specific. This was a powerful <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E52\">anecdote or powerful kind of hook to hang some things that were a little bit murky and we didn\u2019t have that on Tuesday but we had it today. And that\u2019s what comes to mind. And maybe that\u2019s not very helpful in trying to extrapolate from our conversations to real life in the sense that \u2013 maybe it is helpful. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E53\">I mean maybe it\u2019s useful to think about the reassurance I get from people as a kind of narrative hook or a story that I can tell myself, maybe that\u2019s a useful analogy. But I don\u2019t see any immediate application of the apparently active influence of this anecdotal mention or from college, I guess, knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562000\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">(Pause): [0:39:02 0:39:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: What does occur to me just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I had another idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: You have another idea. Alright, so the last thing that I\u2019ll say is that resuscitating more of your model, you know, the point about connectedness, you know, I think that\u2019s very much a part of the story about my dad and I think that\u2019s a very close parallel with these lifelines that I request, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">agitate for, from people that I\u2019m working with when they reassure me and really incarnate for me the story of our relationship, the story of my functionality within some (unclear).
