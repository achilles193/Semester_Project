And I was\u2026 I\u2019ve been\u2026 I was expecting at some point there\u2019s like a deductible, like 50 bucks, right? Did that just never even\u2026 that was my understanding when I budgeted out for it. I mean, it was like $1,000 beforehand. But I was expecting to\u2026 I think there was 50 bucks that you probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">didn\u2019t get at some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll go back and check. Is there a deductible for it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:01:58) was $50 deductible for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I never caught it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Cool. It\u2019s been nice, actually, being able\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s really an incredible situation I have at this point. I mean, I come for free. It\u2019s not only like just fantastic in terms of having any kind of healthcare for free. But particularly how much money I used to spend on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What is that all\u2026 how does it all shake out for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s really bizarre. Just logistically it\u2019s bizarre that when I stop working and I go back to school, then things\u2026 this thing became free or something because beforehand I was paying as much as I was paying for rent. You know what I mean? Granted I was coming more often so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">I mean, it\u2019s been nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">It\u2019s been helpful and it\u2019s reduced my thinking about\u2026 like I remember at times I was kind of I think one of the factors in the equation of how I felt about all of this was the fact that I was working so much for it to happen.  And I was spending so much money for it. And I think in some ways that at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">certain times if I felt like I wasn\u2019t getting a great experience out of it, it would kind of compound my frustration or something. Because I mean, I was spending\u2026 I spent as much as I was spending on rent almost a month. So in those moments\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Major expense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: \u2026the money element became something I would think a lot about. You know what I mean? Whereas that\u2019s not something right now obviously. I don\u2019t ever question if I\u2019m spending too much money on this because I\u2019m not spending any money on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563417\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right. And so it removes a certain amount of frustration and with\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Just on my life in general in a sense. It makes things a lot easier money-wise.  But there is like a dynamic whereby I imagine this happens anytime someone pays for something. There\u2019s an aspect of deserving this or quid pro quo. You know what I mean? In a way I kind of felt like I was investing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">more. I was making a bigger commitment. You know what I mean? In a way I was not only putting in the 50 minutes that I had here every week but also the however many hours of work I had to do a week to pay for it. You know what I mean? And it feels different. I don\u2019t really know how to explain it but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: With that sense of like concrete financial investment, it can feel differently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I think like a while ago when we had that kind of interesting conversation where I kind of said to you like I want to get more out of this. That was much easier to say at the time given the fact that I was working that hard. I mean, it would feel\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t feel as kind of justified or qualified <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">in saying that right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I see what you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: You know what I mean? Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yea, it actually can help you feel more entitled to say it. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I mean, I think entitled is a good way to put it. I mean, I felt like it wasn\u2019t a freebie or something. You know what I mean? (pause) And I don\u2019t know. I mean, I wonder maybe if it also led me to take it more seriously almost, too.  Not to\u2026 that doesn\u2019t sound the way I wanted it to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, what do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, I mean like the fact, I mean, to suggest that I take it less seriously now or something. But I guess it made me\u2026 I don\u2019t know. When you pay so much for something, you take better care of it or it\u2019s more precious or something. You know what I mean? There\u2019s a value that comes with it, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yea, it\u2019s\u2026 yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: So it was a dynamic of our relationship, I guess, that played out in different ways. But\u2026 (pause) But altogether, just I mean, at this point in time I just feel extraordinarily fortunate to be in this situation. It would\u2019ve been difficult. I mean, I don\u2019t really\u2026 it would\u2019ve been difficult probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">even to do once a week at the costs that we were doing in the past. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What were you doing in that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I mean, it was $37 I was paying an appointment and we\u2019re going twice a week. And it\u2019s almost like $400\u2026 or I think it was like $375 or something a month and I paid $450 for rent a month. So it was big. I think I talked a lot about also how having that dollar sign to it. Because I\u2019m constantly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">doing money out and like kind of writing it out and kind of making lists and stuff. And I would constantly see doctor plan kind of right next to rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right in black and white.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I\u2019d often think like it was\u2026 what was the hierarchy of needs like the\u2026 was it Malthus?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Maslow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Maslow.  I mean, I would think about it that way a lot and it\u2019d be like rent, like shelter, is the most basic, most important need. And then it trickles down to things like art or something maybe or interests or something. And it was just always interesting. I\u2019d always kind of think to myself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">wow, I have my therapy and my most basic fundamental level of needs. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563417\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yea, there it is in black and white right next to rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right next to food and shelter and safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What is that\u2026 what did that kind of mean to you? That it was right there, it was equal with all that. What\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I think it\u2026 partially I think kind of put some pressure on it in a way. (pause) I think it made it\u2026 simplest way, it made it a big deal just in and of itself.  I think it made it something I thought about a lot more, by extension, probably worried about it a lot more. I worried about this more <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">than I do now. I don\u2019t worry about this so much anymore. I don\u2019t get anxious so much anymore that you don\u2019t look forward to our appointments like I used to. I don\u2019t question if I should be coming. If I actually have the entrenched psychological issues that warrant that kind of investment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Wait. Say that again. What\u2019s that last part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I used to worry. I\u2019d be like I\u2019m spending $430 a month, say. I don\u2019t know what it was. Like if I was spending $2,000 a month on rent for my apartment, I would say to myself, this isn\u2019t worth $2,000 a month so I shouldn\u2019t be paying $2,000 a month for this. So I should stop paying this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yea, you said that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: And I\u2019d look at the $430 a month and I would say this is a lot of money for someone in my position to be spending on therapy. Do I have a need for that warrants that? Do I actually have $430 worth of issues\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: \u2026to come here? I didn\u2019t know. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: What did you think? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I thought something different like 100 times a day sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Is that right? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: It was something I grappled with and went back and forth. It became a way that I reflected upon this and made sense of it and stuff in a way that I don\u2019t do now which I think is relaxing particularly because in a way financially it was kind of like a secret. I didn\u2019t really speak to, for example, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">my dad. Sometimes we would talk about finances. But even when I kind of broke down with him, he\u2019d say, \u201cHow much you spent on rent a month?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cOh, 450 hundred bucks here, hundred bucks there.\u201d And then if I ever kind of said to him like, \u201cDad, like I really need some help financially,\u201d I probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200832\">wouldn\u2019t just because like if you\u2019re getting audited by the IRS, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhere is this $430 going every month or something?\u201d  You know what I mean? And it became something I felt like I had to justify or I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well, what did you\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Because I didn\u2019t tell my dad I was coming here and I couldn\u2019t tell him, \u201cWell, I need extra money because I\u2019m spending $400 a month on therapy.\u201d Then it would be like, \u201cWhat, really? Oh, why? How long have you been doing that? Why are you spending that much money on it?\u201d I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">not\u2026 it just wasn\u2019t something I would\u2019ve done for the same reasons I don\u2019t talk to my dad about all sorts of things. You know what I mean? So it became this thing that I kind of took on myself that I had to kind of\u2026 I couldn\u2019t ask kind of for help for or something.  You know what I mean? It made me <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200872\">very defensive about my finances in a way. I didn\u2019t like to talk about it with my mom.

She helped me actually get here for the first time and pay the first $1,000, remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: I remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: And sometimes she\u2019ll ask me, \u201cHow\u2019s it going and stuff?\u201d  And usually I just tell her. \u201cIf I wanted to talk about this stuff with everybody I wouldn\u2019t be\u2026 I need Dennis to come here and talk about it with him.\u201d You know what I mean? I talk about it with you. But I feel like if I told her I pay <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">that much a month, if I told her that sometimes I went without other things, it would seem to quantify the seriousness or something in a way that I don\u2019t like to do with her. It would seem to be doing something very different than saying like, \u201cI\u2019m doing fine.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: She\u2026 because she\u2019d see the need in black and white, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yea. She would be like\u2026 I just imagine that if I told her she would be like, \u201cWow, you pay that much? Why?\u201d As if I\u2019d told her I was paying $1,000 a month the question would be like, \u201cHow does that make sense? Why would you do that?\u201d  (pause) Which is just not the kind of\u2026 which is the type <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">of thing that I just in different ways I feel like I\u2019m always trying avoid. You know what I mean? In the same way that I don\u2019t like to talk about certain things with my mom about my dad or something, you know what I mean? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yea, they\u2019d ask questions, \u201cWhy? Why?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yea, my mom said like, \u201cGeoffrey, let\u2019s sit down and have a conversation about the divorce.\u201d I\u2019d probably just leave or something. I would avoid it. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I don\u2019t really know why but I know I don\u2019t want to. And I know that I don\u2019t. I know that I avoid it. So the amount <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">of money I spent became something that I avoided in the same way that made me uncomfortable that I wouldn\u2019t want her to know about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">I guess because she\u2019d think I was really upset. She\u2019d think I was doing really bad, that I was hurt. She\u2019d think that she hurt me or something. That\u2019s what she would think. That\u2019s what I think she would think and I obviously don\u2019t want to make my mom cry or think she\u2019s a bad mom or something. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">But a lot of those things have significantly relaxed, though. I don\u2019t think about those things so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s off the table, I guess in that sense. That you\u2019ll lose that aspect of it coming up. Yea, in a way it kind of\u2026 it\u2019s this kind of really\u2026 it sounds like it\u2019s a complicated thing.  Like you felt that it signified how important it was to you and it made you go, \u201cIs it really this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">important? And if it is, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s\u2026 it almost revealed to you like how important it actually was from one standpoint. I was just thinking that the level of\u2026 the way\u2026 one way in which you experienced it was, \u201cGod, look how much I\u2019m spending. This means a lot.\u201d And then when exactly at that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F2\">moment when you become aware of how much it means it has all these ramifications to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563417\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yea.

Not to say that\u2019s not the element of it, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: I mean like\u2026 but I mean, yea, but it was. It was both of those things bouncing back and forth. And I\u2019m just thinking about it now, too.  When I was spending that much money\u2026 recently like over the last couple months or something I feel like I\u2019ve brought up the topic of I\u2019d like to maybe\u2026 sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">I feel like I need to kind of have something that I\u2019m upset about when I come here, right? We\u2019ve talked about this. I feel like it wouldn\u2019t seem appropriate for me to just come here and say I\u2019m in a really great mood and just kind of talk to you about what my day was like or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">I don\u2019t exactly know why but that just seems like not what I\u2019m supposed to be doing or something. And sometimes I feel like I need to find something like on the way here to be upset about. You know what I mean? That I felt much stronger.  I felt that compulsion a whole lot stronger when I was spending <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">that much money. It would\u2019ve felt even more inappropriate when I was spending $400 a month to come here and not be upset about something. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: It wouldn\u2019t make sense to spend that much money to come and talk to a therapist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: And just be happy. It almost made it really important for me to find things that I was upset about in a way. I would\u2019ve like almost felt guilty if I didn\u2019t or something. (pause) And that I feel like has relaxed a lot now that I don\u2019t pay anything. It seems like it\u2019s a little easier just to kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">of not be upset about things.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: What\u2026 because if you were coming in and didn\u2019t have anything to\u2026 if you didn\u2019t bring anything in, what do you feel irresponsible about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well, at $400 is the amount that I invested in, $400 that I don\u2019t just have lying around. If that\u2019s the number of units that I invest in this that I could be doing something else with and if that\u2019s the importance, $400 worth of importance, it\u2019s important. And it\u2019s justified if there\u2019s actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">like a corresponding amount of need which is me having issues you know what I mean to deal with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">It would be\u2026 if I said to my mom, \u201cMom, I spend $2,000 a month on therapy,\u201d and she said, \u201cMan, what kind of issues do you talk about?\u201d And I said, \u201cNothing. We actually just kind of\u2026 I just kind of just shoot the shit with him. I have conversations with him that I could have with Eric.\u201d That would <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">be flagrantly irresponsible. You know what I mean? That would not be a justifiable use of that money. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve got to use it in a certain way that doesn\u2019t feel the right way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Does that make sense to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Would you keep going to the doctor to have tests done if you know there\u2019s nothing wrong, spending hundreds of dollars every time when you\u2019re on a fixed budget?

Maybe I could imagine if this got put on the front page of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">New York Times and my dad asked me about it I could have a more confident conversation with him about it.  Because there\u2019s this connection between things or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the\u2026 if it was on the Times?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: If my dad found out, if he asked me, \u201cWhy do you do that then?\u201d Because it seems to me like it would be an insinuation like, \u201cDid we mess up as parents that much\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: \u201c\u2026for $400 a month?\u201d I don\u2019t know.

It can feel like a potential indictment about the parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Well, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And boy, does that raise all sorts of stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yea, it\u2019s an indictment of a certain level of seriousness that I almost feel like I\u2019m coming here to try to figure out if it even exists. You know what I mean? Am I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Is it justifiable that this is worth this much to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yea. I mean, it seems to presume like an answer to the question. Or presume like a level of confidence that there are actually these issues that I have. And partially I feel like I came here because I just wanted to figure that out. And at times when I felt really unsure about it, would feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">guilty about thinking it, the money kind of compounded that. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yea. No, I see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: And I wouldn\u2019t feel confident kind of justifying it to my dad or something unless I could spell it out the way I like to be able to do in class.  A and B, therefore C. You know what I mean? That\u2019s the type of clarity I rarely have in this field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Well, yea. In my mind, it kind of goes back to the whole kind of notion of the good divorce. And as if you\u2026 there was no\u2026 that you weren\u2019t\u2026 it would mean a lot if you didn\u2019t play by that book. And almost like, \u201cWhat are saying it\u2019s not a good divorce? What are you saying?\u201d That wait, there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">all this level of angst inside of you. \u201cWhat does all this mean? What are you saying about us? What are saying about me as a parent? What are you saying about how you really feel? Why you\u2019re changing the story?

We used to talk a lot about that. Like that would be the counter narrative that seems to sort of hold the level of clarity that I\u2019m kind of referring to. It\u2019s like because that is there, like that seems to be the presumption <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">now. You know what I mean? \u201cWhat do you mean? What about\u2026 kind of like didn\u2019t we all kind of agree on this or something?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: There\u2019s a presumption that that\u2019s the reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: And it requires a good defense or something which I feel really anxious about.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563417\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. And the money really brings that into the\u2026 so it really heightens that conflict or heightens that question.  Like the\u2026 (snaps fingers) It\u2019s kind of like you\u2019re putting something very concretely out there that, \u201cI\u2019m paying for this. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">means something.\u201d It\u2019s like it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: And it calls that into question very seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. It really clearly asserts a different kind of story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s planting a flag in a different area. In a way it kind of required me to justify it enough to be confident about keep doing it before I could really just kind of comfortably try to work through it, I guess. And I think it led to a lot of anxiety and I think sometimes like feelings of guilt <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">or something like I was just kind of betraying or something.  Doing something dishonest or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: \u2026I think it just put a lot of pressure and tension on the process here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: And it actually in not all negative ways in that\u2026 and as much it really brought up\u2026 it brought into a lot more focus, this feeling you have of how my\u2026 for you, your experience varied from this other story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s the irony of it was despite all of this lack of clarity, as time went on I would look back and be like but I\u2019m doing it. If there were certain things that wouldn\u2019t be clear to me like if I have like a really conflicted relationship with this kind of bookshelf.  It\u2019s no more clear <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">to me that I do have a conflicted relationship with this bookshelf with my parents but I would not spend the amount of money that I did on our relationship with my parents trying to figure that out. You know what I mean? So it seems to sort of suggest something like an answer to me. Why do I keep doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201052\">it, if nothing else. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">It\u2019s like that time when I said I was in the grocery store and I made that claim. I said that thing to that woman about my parents, \u201cThey argue a lot.\u201d  It\u2019s kind of like\u2026 and I had that conversation with my dad. Kind of like an Orwellian way I kind of said\u2026 I could tell he was mad. And he was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">\u201cDo your parents argue a lot? Do we argue a lot?\u201d And in my head I was like yea. But evidently he didn\u2019t want me to say that so I was like no. And then I just kind of said, \u201cAll right. Listen, you don\u2019t say that unless you have some particularly solid grounding or something.\u201d And this would\u2019ve felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201072\">like saying that to my dad.

You <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">know what I mean? I won\u2019t have this opportunity forever. Hell, if someone said you could have a boat for a year.

It\u2019s funny. I just thought about it like with my dad. Like my dad\u2019s in relationships with women who take it seriously. He never takes it seriously.  That\u2019s like an emotionally pathological thing to be comfortable with in my opinion. Like this did not see that as problematic. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B1\">That\u2019s not what healthy, constructive, good people do. I don\u2019t know. (pause) That\u2019s\u2026 yea.

And like\u2026 and just right back I think you\u2019ve spoken about it. To be consciously disregarding something like that and then be able to fall asleep at night like my dad does, that is\u2026 that\u2019s bad. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s bad. That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: To be able to be doing something like that that I see as so contemptible.

Nowhere in that line of thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201631\">does the wellbeing of somebody else come up.

But I wouldn\u2019t want to be perceived by you the way I perceive <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B1\">my dad. \u201cGeoffrey doesn\u2019t really take this too seriously. He seems to not care.

I was also thinking that in some way it puts you in the position of if you change the narrative, it\u2019s going to make people feel a different way.

I mean, particularly when I\u2019m really unsure about the narrative. If I was really, really confident about a narrative I can do some of these wacky things I fantasize about telling my dad off, punching him in the head and never talking to him again. You know what I mean? It comes back to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F1\">that uncertainty. Like being really pressed on like I was on the stand in court.
