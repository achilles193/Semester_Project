I\u2019ve been working on stuff around home and (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Did you have a lot of people cry today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: None that I can think of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Today I think to myself that\u2019s one part that I\u2019m (unclear) of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: In the mirror? Who knows what they say but they\u2019re all jammed up with their emotions up there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re part of the line, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: So if there are a lot of people crying there\u2019s just so much I can take probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s still left of me to offer? Well I am a little harried getting in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. This morning or just now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Just now. I\u2019d just taken that phone call and making sure that this stuff at my house is settled. But it\u2019s all taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(Pause): [0:02:02 \u2013 0:02:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Do you mind if I record this on my own records?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I could send you a copy if you\u2019d like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Maybe I\u2019ll take advantage of that. Probably take the best ones. So this one dealership, like the guy wants to hire me there. I\u2019ve been sort of looking at car dealerships and convinced them of how recent this is where they know about it but I\u2019m convinced I want to sell cars. The guy at the Honda <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">dealership was actually interested but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be the best person to train me. I think it was apparent how good the training was but I could impress him pretty quickly with what I knew with the training I took at the last place that didn\u2019t come through at Dupont Circle. But I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">to be able to contact people on a structured basis and try and sell something. I guess in one way it\u2019s like a sublimation of a desire to please or something. It\u2019s wanting to sell something and being satisfied if I sell this vicarious product. But I just thought of that now. The main thing for me is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D3\">that like I can work with people during the day, you know, they\u2019ll come to me. I don\u2019t have to go to them and be helpful and probably do better than most of the other people around. But I\u2019d rather work for like Mercedes or Lexus in Salisbury which is much closer than the dealership in Dunmore where <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D4\">I kind of moved from. The guy there is kind of seedy. Plus he called me afterwards \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m just checking in, calling from my home and I just wanted to sort of talk to you about what you took away from our interview today. The guy spent like an hour on me just in training. And that dealership is good <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D5\">because I think the (unclear) of the lower middle class still has to get Hondas. Like I think people at Amherst think that Honda is pretty good. They got their Hondas in the last 15 years. But if you\u2019re ever in East Providence you have yet to buy a Honda. It\u2019s not a bad place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re selling cars now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I went into the Mercedes dealership in Landover. I\u2019d never been in there before but like the showroom floor is incredible. The coffee is great. Everything\u2019s separated and organized. When I went there the general manager was about to start an auction so he couldn\u2019t talk to me. I didn\u2019t even like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">looking him in the eye so I just shook his hand and said something like, yes sir or thank you sir instead of something bold and boastful to make an impression. And I never know with these car dealerships whether these things sound like a ruse, whether they really have an auction or if it\u2019s a stand in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">for a customer excuse. Maybe I think about it too much, like customers have all kinds of excuses that you have to kind of overcome like oh, I have to get my dry cleaning. Thanks for all the information on the car but I left the baby (unclear), you know? So he never showed up but I don\u2019t think I left <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200313\">a good impression anyway. And it doesn\u2019t matter because I start work at the Honda place on Monday but I really wanted to get someplace better before then but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563327\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">The interesting thing about the training is the guy\u2019s not that great so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: (Unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean he\u2019s been in the business for 35 years and he\u2019s only been promoted once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s he? General manager?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: He\u2019s the sales manager. There\u2019s sales, sales manager, general sales manager and general manager. (Unclear) general manager sometimes. I think what it brings out in terms of having a sort of gentle demeanor and encouraging me to sort of take everything in with people instead of backing away from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">people and being kind of stand-offish and proud and things like that. I mean you have to accept what people are (unclear) at you. You have to keep an even keel and keep them in the business process, right? I appreciate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And come to you (unclear) come to you. [0:08:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I try to make it my business to drum up interest but it\u2019s really hard. So one of the key things that I state when I\u2019m (unclear) \u2013 I\u2019ve probably got five in the past week and that\u2019s just, you know, why do you want to sell cars? Because everyone who walks into a car dealership wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">to buy a car. That\u2019s the tagline. But it\u2019s true in a sense. If you\u2019re in a dealership you want to buy a car or something. You love to paint. (Laughs). But the other part of it is, I recognize from living with Edgar, my past roommate, that there are aspects of the sales process that apply to landing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">women. There\u2019s a lot of similarity. Like selling a car or selling a product is lot like going all the way. It\u2019s a \u2013 both the processes where if you frame things in certain ways you can have a much easier time of it than if you allow objections to sort of take the stage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Are you serious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well if you frame the process, if you frame things a certain way, you can get what you want more easily than if you entertain or if you allow objections to take control of the process. What I\u2019m saying sounds like rape maybe, but what I\u2019m actually saying is that the way you, if you steer things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">correctly you just avoid the objections \u2013 it\u2019s there or it\u2019s not there. It\u2019s that if you have a certain mindset and also protocol, you just avoid objections as opposed to asking for the basic thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there\u2019s something about it, about the feeling of being \u2013 I don\u2019t know, the way you describe it is like that sales can be a way of kind of being more effective socially or (unclear) or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, the idea of structuring social relations. Some sort of guide is incredibly appealing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m struck too by your indicating last time about how it was particularly troublesome to you, troubling to you about that guy that you dealt with last week that you said he was structured and that maybe in some ways you found that in certain situations other people like, almost like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">you feel what you don\u2019t have enough in terms of your own influence or your own thing \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563327\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Effectiveness, if you want to put it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, taking this kind of nascent analogy. It\u2019s like whenever you interact with another person you each have your own game but certain people\u2019s games like absorb the other person without them knowing it. I mean if they\u2019re really good (unclear) but usually you sense something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Did you see \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s all about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Oh really. I\u2019ll have to see that. Most recently I \u2013 there\u2019s this editing group I\u2019m in and there\u2019s this 19 year old girl. I didn\u2019t really want her except she\u2019s the prettiest girl in the group and then there\u2019s this other guy who\u2019s just getting back into finance who\u2019s also interested in her. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">can tell. And so then I kind of want her just because \u2013 I don\u2019t know why. So after a session last night we were just sort of leaving, talking, and she asked me if I knew about this Vietnamese restaurant and I said no, I\u2019ve only had Vietnamese once. So we went there and then she was just sort of like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">\u2018I\u2019m just waiting for my sister. It will be 30 minutes, but we could do whatever.\u2019 And I said, \u2018well, do you want to eat?\u2019 She said, no because I think we\u2019re going to eat at my sister\u2019s apartment with her roommate \u2013 or something like that. So when a friend showed up whom she\u2019d mentioned I sort of steered <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200573\">us towards eating at the place. So the three of us were eating there and it\u2019s another guy and me and this girl. I don\u2019t know how the girl is related to the guy or how much they know each other. But I\u2019m there making eye contact constantly, trying to some extent, just a little bit jabbing the other guy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200574\">trying to undercut him but \u2013 So yes I\u2019m there, I\u2019m with them and I don\u2019t know where things are going but then the sister comes and she\u2019s also beautiful and she\u2019s like 23 or something. So the guy knows both of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">And we have really good conversations like I\u2019m talking to the 19 year old and her sister and sometimes the guy. And then switch off and then the guy and the 23 year old will be talking and then I and the 19 year old and the guy and the 19 year old. And this worked out well. And after that there\u2019s another <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">like ambiguous point and instead of excusing myself like I am wont to do I say, \u2018well, what do you want to do? Are you going to watch a movie or something like that?\u2019 So they invited me back to their apartment and so I\u2019m in this apartment with two girls and the guy and she starts cooking dinner though <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">we just went out. Oh, and there\u2019s a guitar there so I asked if they played guitar and she said yes. I asked, what kind. Classical guitar. So I started playing guitar and they were impressed with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">But also coming off this, I mean with my whole masturbation thing, I had masturbated just whatever two days before, several times, and I\u2019d come off a period of like two weeks without breaking my arcane standards, but I probably jacked off like three or four times weekends so I was coming off only two <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">days of rest between that and I felt kind of depleted so in like four days I\u2019d probably jacked off four times or something like that, so I didn\u2019t have that much sexual energy which normally would leave me \u2013 I mean, the day after I just can\u2019t do anything like I can\u2019t organize my thoughts. I just lie <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">there. But I sort of took a different approach this evening and just decided to keep pushing even though I\u2019d probably be in (unclear) endeavor in some sense. Not keep pushing but just not really (unclear) on myself like pick myself apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563327\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">I\u2019d made a conscious effort to keep it on a different level which I\u2019m not sure I can always do but I did it that night. And what I mean, I thought of that because of how it relates to well I can sing and I can\u2019t sing that well (unclear). [0:17:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: (Unclear)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Your voice is \u2013 it\u2019s you in some sense and when you\u2019re depleted or when you have to realize too is singing or making noises is rooted in like courtship probably at the most basic level. And for some reason after ejaculating a lot it just, or even (unclear), it just diminishes one\u2019s confidence <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">in one\u2019s voice but also the quality of singing is just not as good. I can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s an empirical \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you don\u2019t feel what \u2013 yourself? Or fully in yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I mean this time I ignored that but in terms of that it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t feel fully myself. I feel like empty. Something\u2019s missing like a (unclear) that\u2019s missing a (unclear). Like a BLT without bacon. Or \u2013 I don\u2019t know what else. Something\u2019s missing and it helps bring everything together \u2013 who you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">are. But anyway I was just doing that. I mean the other guy, after I was singing, he was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to go.\u2019 And because they could both play the guitar, too. So we were having a good time. I mean whereas at the meal he was kind of dictating the conversation some of the time. He was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">just a (unclear) person. [0:18:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">Here I could pass the guitar around. I also feel when I talk about class just an issue of air time, like who\u2019s taking up, really just air time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Almost like it was choreographed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, what\u2019s the setting, what\u2019s the context?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s so much better \u2013 you feel a lot more at ease obviously when you\u2019re more in the driver\u2019s seat although that can have its own anxieties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel bad for him like when he said that I tried to \u2013 I made a point of trying to connect with him and he\u2019d say like, \u2018do you smoke?\u2019 Or trying to find some similarities because I think he does smoke. So I said, \u2018dude, I don\u2019t smoke marijuana but I\u2019ve taken to smoking cigarettes lately, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">a few.\u2019 I think he smokes marijuana. But it doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: One thing that I\u2019m (unclear) is that like for you if there\u2019s the feeling that he\u2019s kind of choreographing things or dictating things you can feel very excluded or lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Absolutely. Yeah. I mean I\u2019m reading the body language of the elder sister. On the way there we\u2019re walking and waiting for the younger sister to get some things from her apartment. The older sister\u2019s kind of blocking me off I think. So the guy\u2019s there and he\u2019s talking about random shit and he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">like leaning up against the wall and I\u2019m like there and she\u2019s like this. I mean this is her body language so she\u2019s blocking me off a little bit. Not only is she leaning against the wall, also her foot is a kind of barrier and it\u2019s pointing towards him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563327\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right. Turned towards him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Like I was facing you. You\u2019re the guy who was talking so she\u2019s \u2013 I mean in terms of her upper body she was being very polite and everything but the lower body is less conscious and more telling sometimes. Things like that hurt me, I mean, on some level I\u2019m sensing all this and trying to use <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">it to some advantage but still it gets to you. I want to know I\u2019m reaching people almost at all times. And I don\u2019t really break up things to try and do it. Like if I\u2019m respectful of whatever is going on. I mean, that\u2019s not true. I respect \u2013 I try not to judge people I guess is the only thing I can say. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">I can try to steer things away from what\u2019s going on but I don\u2019t really bust it up or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: But it all seems like in service of you\u2019re trying to stake some sort of ground, sort of claim some ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t \u2013 you also don\u2019t feel, it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s about dominance as much as it is a part of it. I mean an important part inside of yourself but I think why I got the whole why this is like dominance is that it didn\u2019t \u2013 yes, you felt more comfortable steering things around when <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">you were playing guitar and being kind of almost the host or something to that situation. You feel kind of, you don\u2019t want him to kind of feel \u201cI\u2019ve got to go\u201d \u2013 that feeling. But maybe there is. Maybe there is part of it some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: You\u2019re absolutely right. The guy actually told the story about someone who was clearly just trying to control things. Like he would tell his roommates let\u2019s go out this time and then pretty much say, \u2018oh, I\u2019m not ready to leave at this time. And so this guy would say \u2013 once they were ready this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">guy would say, oh I don\u2019t want to leave now. And then he\u2019d say, let\u2019s leave at this time. He just wanted to dictate what was going on with everybody. There\u2019s definitely elements of that in me, just with random stuff. I try to like you\u2019ve seen me go when I (unclear) it\u2019s like random ideas that little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">things should be certain ways. (Unclear). [0:23:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a kind of compulsion to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is. It\u2019s not OCD but yeah. It\u2019s not part of a systematic disorder but it is a compulsion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah and so this guy \u2013 it would have been wonderful if I had just let him leave at that point and he just started talking and he was just like a jabber mouth and sometimes the stuff he said was funny but I don\u2019t know how people can talk like that all the time, just keep talking and he was talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">and I couldn\u2019t play guitar over him so I decided just to let him talk instead. And also how much do people listen to guitar even if it\u2019s good? How much do they pay attention? Even if it\u2019s like really great singing, you\u2019re supposed to like listen there I guess? I don\u2019t know. So I put the guitar away. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">We started watching random (unclear) videos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">At this point my attention was divided between the older sister and the younger sister. I just don\u2019t know \u2013 I mean one\u2019s 19 so she\u2019s years younger than me. She\u2019s still attractive and there\u2019s something very appealing about her, like she has a very organized mind and like very deliberate intention. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">sister is just really smart and considerate and put together, but more thoughtful like me. She also has a boyfriend. But, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even consider that an obstacle. I\u2019m just trying to think like what I could make of a situation with two sisters and one (unclear) and we\u2019re just watching (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200892\">videos. [0:25:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563327\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">The older sister was an excellent host, constantly like providing new food and tea or whatever and they were both \u2013 I learned during these conversations \u2013 they\u2019re both pretty sheltered. They were home-schooled, not much relationship experience and really pretty nice people. So I mean we leave and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">guy says, makes a point of saying he\u2019s going to walk Alana home and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Which one was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: The younger one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Oh, because it\u2019s the 23 year old\u2019s place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. They don\u2019t live together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Different places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: So he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to walk Karlie home.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And these guys they take on the sense of that it\u2019s like a moral obligation when it\u2019s just like a dick move. As far as I can tell this guy\u2019s \u2013 he has a girlfriend elsewhere and he\u2019s their friend like who knows why he\u2019s there, like maybe he hopes to make one of them eventually or I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">no idea. He\u2019s just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. But he was \u2013 I just laughed. It would be a breach of propriety for me to try to stay with the older sister since the younger sister introduced me and invited me to all those things. Although I think I wanted to stay with the older sister. I really didn\u2019t know and I knew with the younger <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">sister the cock block would be going just to make sure I didn\u2019t do anything essentially as a service to the older sister or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">All the cock block is about blood. I mean yeah we got to the younger sister\u2019s apartment and she just said good-bye and gave me a hug and I mean I should have thought of something to say. I mean I should have thought of something to say. I mean this bothers me constantly. These things stay with me. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">need, I want my \u201cin\u201d there. There\u2019s where I want the sales approach or thing that\u2019s (cross talk). \u2018Let me help you with your project.\u2019 Or, \u2018I forgot this book that you have.\u2019 Or something to get up there. And the reason I want to do it is that I want to \u201csentiment\u201d that relationship because I know it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A12\">going to slip just like sand out of my hands unless I have some sort of commitment from somebody else. I need some sort of like solid thing that says yes we knew each other in some point in time and I\u2019m not going to like just disappear into the woodwork. It\u2019s like a security and I\u2019m not very good at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A13\">it and I don\u2019t have much experience with it. But I still feel the need to grab it and the fucking cock blocker \u2013 \u2018and so which way are you going home?\u2019 It\u2019s like I know my way around motherfucker. (Unclear). [0:28:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">Yeah, I didn\u2019t even ask, it would have make sense for me to ask for her number, probably, you know, something. I mean, and maybe my judgment is skewed from most people\u2019s. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with dating a 19-year old. I think that\u2019s like the perfect age. I didn\u2019t have much sexual experience at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">that age. I guess I did at exactly 19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: What does her being 19 mean to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Young. Oh God, just like really life and valuable. Desirable. Yeah, someplace it might be and I can\u2019t sense this completely but it might be a wanting to be close to that, that youth. It\u2019s like for you, it\u2019s like antebellum spirit before you come in contact with what could be a brutal reality <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">of people sort of conspiring against people or people not facilitating each other\u2019s growth necessarily in society. I used to have a very clear idea of you think is important and what you want to do and what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad and how one should behave. I asked her \u2013 (unclear) what\u2019s one thing she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A72\">would change about Providence and she said, well, I wish they had just kept the historical part of Providence that they hadn\u2019t just built building around them, that the buildings were somewhere else, like all the skyscrapers and stuff because like the history is so important. I mean that\u2019s the kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A73\">of thing \u2013 very principled.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563327\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Idealistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And somehow commitment from that sort of person is more solid. Maybe because they\u2019re more vulnerable. I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Trusting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: More trustworthy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. At least they\u2019re not going to fool me as easily. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re trustworthy but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, but believe in, yeah. They wouldn\u2019t be able to slip one over on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: Right. So I mean now the relationship is nowhere because I didn\u2019t seal the deal. I just wish I could have more of those things. Those episodes bother me. I remember specifically like wanting to be with my cousin but like and having this other guy who was a better dancer and more adept, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">was almost a cock blocker that night. I didn\u2019t. I sort of backed off and it hurt me deeply. I mean what do you do with that because you want people to care about you in this way but you can\u2019t quite get that to happen. And you know now I\u2019m on the other side of the spectrum and I have this asshole guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B72\">and he feels there\u2019s some sort of need to protect the younger girl from me because she\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been building a relationship with and he sees it as sort of a moral imperative and more power to him but I feel shafted. I mean I\u2019m alone and I go home. I mean when I\u2019m with people I have ideas of what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B73\">I want to do and how I\u2019m going to do it. But when I get home I\u2019m just like one of those manikins \u2013 or I don\u2019t know if you know those figures that have like string on the inside, elastic string, and you press this button on the bottom and they just collapse. That\u2019s what I\u2019m like when I get home, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B74\">like nothing comes together. There\u2019s no structure. Nothing happens. So I feel victimized, I guess, or something I want to do something about but I can\u2019t. I mean I could easily talk over that guy but I\u2019m sensitive to how he feels and what he thinks or what I conceive him to think is more accurate, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B75\">I don\u2019t issue some lame line like oh, let me borrow this book or some excuse to go up there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and he also won\u2019t go away. You don\u2019t want to hurt him but you also know he won\u2019t go away. He\u2019s obstructive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you really do get \u2013 it brings up the (unclear) get these kind of frustrations whether it was the timing didn\u2019t work out with a woman to ask for her number, was there somebody there that\u2019s an interloper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I try not to get fixated on what\u2019s wrong with her as things transpire. Like you just take things as they are and move on. But I mean everything, on certain nights, everything works out like the friend who would normally walk with my friend and her friend were not in the session we left. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF1\">Neither of us had anything to do the next day. Things were just lining up. And I make an impressive presence in the editing group. But behind all this is my need to seal the deal is that I\u2019m going to have to go to work at this like flimsy car dealership on Monday. I can dress up in my wonderful suit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF2\">I\u2019m not wonderful just now but in my suit and play the part of an entitled, intelligent young man. But come Monday I\u2019m going to be at the plow working for this indolent, self-centered manager without much time or prospects of connecting with people and my finances aren\u2019t in order and everything could <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF3\">just fall apart. That\u2019s like a constant thing. Like I talked to people after episodes like this, you among them certainly, but at least someone said that you don\u2019t have to try and hit a home run, you just don\u2019t have to mess up, it\u2019s not like you have to hit a home run but in these situations I always <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF4\">feel that pressure to like make it home, because I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow and no certainty about tomorrow and I also feel like I said, I\u2019m going to be working Monday. Like in Cinderella, the bell strikes and everything falls apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563327\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I was thinking when you said, \u201cEverything falls apart,\u201d what kind of came to mind too is that how you\u2019ve mentioned that you fall apart when you go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t know that you\u2019re going to have that \u2013 I was thinking, one thought I had was that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be in that solid situation but also solid inside of yourself to have all that go on. You might have felt good that night, up for it. What happens when a woman sees <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C51\">another side of you that\u2019s not so good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">CLIENT: There\u2019s a lot going for me. I think I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">CLIENT: You\u2019re right. In this case like the logistics lined up really well, too. That was what I was most concerned about. So I used this \u2013 I associate it with sales just to sort of gently nudging myself just sort of into the progression of what they were doing that night. And I felt as though my doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">that served no purpose if I didn\u2019t bang the younger girl because I mean what was I all for? I mean I\u2019m [] and I\u2019m just inserting myself into these different environments and if there\u2019s no culmination I mean, what\u2019s it for? I\u2019m not going to be able to re-create that. I know that. I already e-mailed her <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB2\">like this morning saying like well I\u2019ll be in the Square at like 3:30 if you want to watch a movie or something. She was like, \u2018no, I\u2019m booked all weekend or I\u2019m (unclear) all weekend.\u2019 My sort of sense of things is reified. So asking that and she says no. But I mean in terms of the situation of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB3\">night it was incredible how I could suggest something and how quickly she would move. Like when I was editing in class that was my first cue is like she would very quickly like change everything to do it exactly as I\u2019d said.

Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E51\">I\u2019m not even sure it would be a good experience at the end. Like I wouldn\u2019t perform that well probably. I would feel like I wouldn\u2019t do this right. I took her virginity, whatever, and it wasn\u2019t that good. But it would still be a relationship, just like punching someone in the face is a relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E52\">or \u2013 there could be good relationships too, but it\u2019s something. I don\u2019t know. I need to do something about this. I don\u2019t know what it is. Because I can\u2019t have this happen this way. Either I\u2019m too dependent on something that\u2019s not in my real house or I need to get better at getting what I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Well also there\u2019s the comment that someone made to you about \u201cyou\u2019ve got to hit the home run.\u201d There is something that it kind of important about things don\u2019t seem to be able to have like a, there\u2019s almost a kind of all or nothing kind of quality to these experiences where it\u2019s not like there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E71\">a development or progression of closeness that goes on \u2013 that might occur.

It was just constant excuses about shit happening with her father or being busy with law school, legitimate excuses but not what you want.

I think there is a real profound \u2013 there\u2019s a lot that gets heated up inside of you when you\u2019re aware of how much of a connection you\u2019re looking for.
