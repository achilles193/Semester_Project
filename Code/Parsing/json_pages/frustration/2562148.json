It\u2019s just his complexion.] (ph?) (pause) Jennie and I had a talk over the weekend Friday night and I\u2019m having trouble sleeping. I was pretty frustrated. Friday she didn\u2019t come home from work.  She went to a weekly writing club. She meets with another woman and they do work together. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">And then she went to visit a friend of hers who teaches at Northeastern, so they met at Brookline. Basically, it was dawn to dusk. I basically got him up and I think that morning she kind of woke me up and asked me if I would take him first thing in the morning. So it\u2019s now a 13-14 hour day of child <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">care and I was tired and I was pretty fed up.  I\u2019m not sure what I was fed up with exactly. (pause) Usually if I\u2019m home all day I don\u2019t want it to be kind of a pit, so I\u2019ll clean up; and I just did not feel like cleaning up. I felt very domesticated. We had this talk. She had been kind of holding in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">abeyance for a while and during the course of this talk Jennie told me that she doesn\u2019t want to give me time to write because it\u2019s recreational and she struggles to find time to write. It was like if a man had said this to a woman she would fucking go postal.  So I got pretty pissed off. If the situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">had been reversed and I had said this to Jennie she would have completely freaked out. It didn\u2019t get resolved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I read into it exactly quite different from what she said when you guys kind of agreed to about how things are going to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: In addition to this, she has an injury which makes it impossible for her to wash dishes and do the laundry and stuff. I guess some of the hormones that make it possible to have a child come out the birth canal also make women post-partum prone to ligament and [other kinds of infection.] (ph?) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">She\u2019s got pretty bad thumbs, so she went to see the OT today. He told her she can\u2019t do anything with her thumbs for six weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So I had kind of anticipated this so over the weekend I said, \u201cListen, sweetie, part of the tension here is that you are a bit disabled.\u201d And she got mad at me. She was like, \u201cWhy are you accusing me of something?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you of anything. I\u2019m just telling you this is part <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">of the mix here.\u201d So it\u2019s tense and there is no question that this negotiation is made infinitely more difficult and complicated by the fact that this thing . . . (sighs) (pause)  So Jennie is mad about my (pause) what are you calling it? My inhibition. She\u2019s mad. It\u2019s put me out in ways that are not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">great. It\u2019s like . . . I don\u2019t know. Ways that are particularly calculated to make me react in the way that I do and I feel like someone is ripping me off and completely contravening our previous agreements and discussions and arrangements and so on. It\u2019s just like well, you know. I\u2019m working and my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">job is to do this and your job is to take care of the child. Can you imagine if I had said that to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh, that was what she said? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Wow. Yep. I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I\u2019m serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: No, no. That helped illustrate.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562148\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s late at night and we\u2019re having a conversation and we\u2019re both kind of frazzled and tired. I kind of put it aside how angry I was about this. And then today (scoffs) she finally took the divorce papers to the courthouse to file them and she forgot them.  (pause) It\u2019s like you can forget <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">them. Whatever. I was just so pissed off. I thought to myself \u2013 it would be a potentially self-justifying train of thought, but how much of my reluctance to follow through on what I know that I need to do just for my own sake is just . . . I mean this thing has been going on for two years or a year <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">and a half now. She\u2019s been saying she\u2019s going to get a divorce for a year and a half now. She left it so long that there was a complicated thing with Grayson\u2019s paternity. Anyway . . . So I wonder. I wonder about that.  (pause) I felt so screwed. It felt like such a sequence to hear her say that like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">on 15 different levels \u2013 the kind of political level where you realize or have the sense that your commitment to equality is being exploited by somebody for their own gratification at some level, the complete contravention of the agreement that we had made. She\u2019s just like, \u201cWell, I changed my mind.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">(pause)  I didn\u2019t really realize how angry I was until she texted \u2013 as if I was going to laugh about it with her \u2013 about forgetting the fucking divorce papers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: And then the commitment that was to you as much as anything else. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: So I don\u2019t know. Again, I think that all of these issues that are coming out of the woodwork are possibly related to my job situation.  There is no question about it. It\u2019s like push would never have come to shove had it not been for that. On the other hand, it\u2019s interesting. In adversity you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">get a better read on how things work under stress and I\u2019m very troubled by it and angry and resentful and I fear recalcitrant. In other words, I fear triggering this completely self-defeating and self-destructive pattern as part of my reaction to this. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Although, you\u2019re not starting off that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Although you weren\u2019t quite sure how angry you were until a little later, you seem pretty clear about it now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) Among other things, I wonder what it is about me that makes people feel like they have the right to do such things and say such things. (pause)  It\u2019s kind of shocking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t recall you having described stuff quite like this with Jennie before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Never. (pause)  I feel shocked and dismayed on the one hand. On the other hand, I feel a lot of love in our household. People are complicated. (chuckles) I feel love in our household. I feel joy in our joint child rearing. There are these elements, but this thing is shocking. I feel shocked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">by this thing and I don\u2019t know what to do with that. On the one hand, it\u2019s just such a trivial matter. I asked her to basically free me up for ten hours a week and she said no.  I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. It was just such bullshit. (pause) It was shocking (long pause) at some really profound level. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">(pause)  I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be able to negotiate, in a way, her injury is a [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:13) and I\u2019m just going to say okay, fine, but you\u2019re [spelling] (ph?) me for that same ten to 15 hours a week if I\u2019m doing all the housework, right? But that\u2019s not really the point. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">In other words, even under the terms of what strikes me as a very rotten exchange, I think we\u2019ll probably be able to get the same result. But the exchange feels rotten and just kind of my errant talking about what\u2019s going on in his life, modality, and it feels very painfully close to the kinds of circumstances <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200354\">that really trigger the sorts of behavior that I come to you for help with.  I guess this concern and sensitivity to the possibility that there is something about the way that I\u2019m interacting with people that produces this. There is just such a repeated feature. I feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200355\">in a relationship that I had really felt very certain and trusting in this particular respect.  I felt like we had done very good work and this feels like an abrogation of it. (pause) (sighs) Another issue, a kind of strategic issue that I could use some, frankly, just some advice on is you know how <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200356\">these things are. You get into a kind of tug of war about something and if you handle it well it dissolves and if you don\u2019t handle it well, then the structural, the feature of a person\u2019s engagement with the rest of the world can be reinforced. In other words, it\u2019s like the moment when if we handle it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200357\">right it\u2019s like we talk about it and we come to some kind of understanding about it and if we don\u2019t, it kind of hardens. That\u2019s the way it feels. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562148\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: What I think about that is if she comes to you and says, \u201cLook, I was really worn out. It was a long day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: She didn\u2019t. She did not come back and say that. She has remained steadfast in this position as if she was justified and I haven\u2019t pushed the issue because it\u2019s like we are waiting for Spring break and all of these things and I haven\u2019t talked it out with anybody and wanted to. I sometimes talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">this stuff out with friends or sister and I feel somewhat ashamed of this interaction. I don\u2019t want to talk to my sister about it. It feels shameful. It\u2019s embarrassing. (long pause)  It\u2019s like directly after getting screwed by \u2013 anybody can get screwed to the extent that the municipal authority, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">getting screwed by your partner in this way, so to speak. Dismissed. It made me very angry and embarrassed and they are related to each other in this kind of classic. When people talk about really dysfunctional, violent relationships, I think that this mode of interaction is something that develops <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200393\">not infrequently where, on the one hand, you feel undermined and you feel ashamed because of that and that kind of enrages you.  It\u2019s kind of a classic gender conflict. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I feel you\u2019re at this sort of nodal moment with her where . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: I worry about a pattern developing that\u2019s really unhealthy. On the one hand, I feel remorse and frustration for the contribution of my employment difficulties to this. On the other hand, I feel angry and kind of ripped off by both the explicit contravention of the agreement that we had made <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">a week and a half before, let alone around the time that Grayson was born; and by the larger issue of just how we want to run our household and our lives \u2013 this sense which she is engaging in is just a complete role reversal.  It\u2019s ridiculous. (pause) Again, if a man had said that it would just be the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">most obvious, grotesque, chauvinist bullshit. Can you imagine? Where did it come from? (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562148\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s still hard for me to tell. On the one side, you certainly are speaking very clearly and emotionally about how she was and your reactions to it. It seems to me maybe like you feel uncertain or passive in figuring out how to respond.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: I feel uncertain and passive in how to respond. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: I guess I wonder whether that is in part because one of the really troubling aspects of her saying this to you is, I guess, it resonates with some feeling you have about yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: I feel like there is a pattern of relating to people in which, as it seems to me anyway, I give them and with a particular expectation or often explicit \u2013 sometimes not explicit, but often explicit \u2013 and they feel completely free in not giving back and worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: I have something else in mind. You said that and I am sure that was in there, too, but what I was thinking of at this moment was being treated that you don\u2019t belong in the workplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Huh. That I don\u2019t belong in the workplace. You mean in the professional workplace? I don\u2019t think that was Jennie\u2019s implication at all.  My read on her rhetoric was, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re not going to look for a job, then you\u2019ll just be a domestic.\u201d I\u2019m exaggerating. She would never have said anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">like that, but \u2013 you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I thought you quoted her as saying \u201cMy job is this. Your job is to take care of the baby.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: If you\u2019re not looking for a job. Yeah. That is the subtext. She\u2019s angry about . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: That you\u2019re not looking for a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: That I\u2019m not looking for a job and I cannot deny that I\u2019m not looking for a job, even the last three weeks of us talking about my preparation for and interest and focus on and attention to looking for a job, I\u2019m still not looking for a job.  So both of these things are operating simultaneously. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">On the one hand, I feel this sense of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Right. There is a betrayal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Outrage and betrayal. On the other hand, I feel remorse and guilt and shame. It makes calibrating my response more difficult I think because these two impulses interact with each other in a very uncertain way. It\u2019s like maybe I deserve it. Maybe I don\u2019t have standing to be outraged, given the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">circumstances. I think it\u2019s always the case in all of these circumstances.  There\u2019s always something that I feel like I\u2019m not doing that makes it difficult for me to [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:14). It makes it difficult for me to respond, \u201cThis is outrageous. This is just completely unreasonable.\u201d Or it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">feels that way. Or it takes a long time for me to make it explicit or conscious enough to engage in that kind of an intervention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Right. I think that it seems to me that the way this is making you doubt yourself and because of that be kind of passive and uncertain about how to respond, it\u2019s probably the same thing that\u2019s getting in the way of looking for jobs. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562148\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: The same thing that makes me doubt myself, making me passive about how to respond is the same thing that\u2019s getting in the way of looking for jobs. Yeah. There is a complex there. There is no question about it. I think that\u2019s one aspect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: In other words, when you\u2019re talking to me there is a way that I found myself waiting to hear you out on what you\u2019re describing with her and waiting without much to say. It occurred to me after a little while I felt a little bit of a pull from you, maybe wrongly, to advise or to suggest or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">something. You also felt like, \u201cGod, I\u2019m so pissed off. It\u2019s ridiculous. And now what?\u201d  That reminded me of the conversation we had but also that kind of passivity that also goes along with not looking for jobs. But in this case, I guess what\u2019s informative or illuminating is that you\u2019re so clear about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B2\">why, at least at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not a case that I\u2019m not clear. It\u2019s always an interactive thing. It\u2019s easy to be clear in conversation with somebody else. The passivity is interactive. I think we\u2019ve kind of ascertained that, to my satisfaction at least, even when it\u2019s not like a known person that I\u2019m interacting with, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">there is always some kind of interpersonal issue at work.  (pause) They should really name personality disorders \u201cinterpersonality disorders.\u201d I think it would make a lot more sense. (both chuckle) (pause) I guess they\u2019re probably not going to come out with another [DSO] (ph?) for a while. (both laugh) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">I think the other thought that was in my head was that on the flip side, the same reason that I feel impassive in this interaction and having difficulty looking for jobs is that I was testing something and testing whether it felt it could be relied upon, in some ways, her end of the bargain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure in what way it wasn\u2019t her end of the bargain. I\u2019m disagreeing with you, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: On the one hand, the passivity and my interaction with Jennie has a single etiology with the passivity in doing what I want to do to move my life forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: It seems to me you\u2019ve got these three stepping stones going at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t think that metaphor works, but keep going. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: The first one is this sort of floating a test with Jennie to see if she would back you up on this. And that\u2019s one. Now there is the writing in the first place, which is sort of not a job and not looking for a job, but has some kind of relation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Vocational activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Exactly. So it\u2019s sort of similarly kind of a test pull or something like that. Then the work with me, I think, is in that same category as well where it requires trust in a way and a sort of faith and an uncertainty about how things are going to turn out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: You wouldn\u2019t call it avocational. It\u2019s life. (both laugh) It\u2019s an important life interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems like each one of them involves the same kind of trusting step and the process for yourself of some space to sort this out, this one particular step. You\u2019re getting back what you hoped not to get with Jennie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m getting just what I hoped not to get with Jennie. I feel like there is a process underway that I need to respond to that is complex and requires some interaction. Maybe it\u2019s just the opportunity that I want to kind of deploy some things that maybe I\u2019m doing better than <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">I used to. It is exactly what I would have hoped not to have. It\u2019s a bad result in my point of view and one interesting thing . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562148\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: I think also it\u2019s significant. One thing you\u2019re wanting to find out is that from Jennie, from me and from yourself, you actually are getting what you need to allow you to move forward.  It\u2019s that metaphor of a stepping stone quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: The thought we had earlier that was true is that it\u2019s amazing that even a completely failed metaphor can completely communicate exactly what you want to communicate so long as there is a minimal level of communication. The interesting thing is that I haven\u2019t stopped working. I just said, \u201cOkay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">fine. I\u2019m just going to defer this consciously.\u201d I don\u2019t quite have the clarity to really reengage with this right now, so let\u2019s put it aside with Jennie for the moment. But after Grayson goes to bed I\u2019m just going to spend my whole evening writing.\u201d  And I have. So on the one hand, I feel angry about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200752\">it. On the other hand, at some level I guess you could say in a way that\u2019s led to some kind of classic errant disengagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: In that you haven\u2019t taken [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Sort of taken up the cudgel. I haven\u2019t forced the issue again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: There may be some elements of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not being passive in . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: No. In thinking about it and knowing that you\u2019re pissed off about it and sort of wanting to talk to people about it and not the usual thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s interesting.  It seems like a significant [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:06). I put it in the top of my bag and told her that she \u2013 whatever. The complexity is that she\u2019s on break this week so it\u2019s sort of a non-standard week this week. The [zero suddenness] (ph?) of this tension comes up <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">during school. I\u2019ve not had a problem otherwise. Now if what I had to write had been for Jennie, that probably would have been a different story. In other words, it probably would have been more the analog of what we\u2019re talking about here. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: I had another thought. When I mentioned to you a few minutes ago about your sort of seeming to stop in my feeling this kind of pull to give advice or to suggest what you should do, it just occurred to me that I wonder if she felt something like that, like you asked a few minutes ago \u201cwhy <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">do people do this to me?\u201d and what I\u2019m wondering is if whether there is something about the way you are passive with the job stuff that\u2019s really setting her off in such a way that she kind of can\u2019t contain it and let you have it about it. Like Galen (sp?) needs an ass kicking here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. That is some pretty plausible construction.  Maybe. Put it this way, one of the reasons that I\u2019m passive and unsure about how to respond is that, on the one hand, if the tables were turned and I had told her, \u201cYour job is to stay in the kitchen and be barefoot and pregnant,\u201d then she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">freak out. On the other hand, if she was completely unable to look for work and despite all of the intent to do so and I had tried various ways of interacting with that, at a certain point I would be like, \u201cOkay. What now?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562148\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: But this isn\u2019t even her saying \u201cwhat now?\u201d This is her saying \u201cfuck you.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: (laughs) [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:02) (both laugh) That was one of the scenarios that I had entertained early on after this conversation. How do I respond to that? I do not endure [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:33) (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: Just in the abstract.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">CLIENT: I\u2019m empathetic, you know?  Something here, I think, is that I have difficulty controlling my empathy, to the point where even in difficult negotiations, I can\u2019t suppress a feeling that maybe what they\u2019re doing is reasonable and I feel for them and so on and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">THERAPIST: I think in this case it may be much more particular in that I think you feel in yourself both sides of this one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">CLIENT: True. For sure. For sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: Both the tremendous frustration . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Touch\u00e9. Last week or whatever you kind of used \u2013 maybe you intended it as a [troll] (ph?); maybe you intended it as an intergenerational analysis \u2013 this idea of my mom and my dad both being kind of embedded in some kind of conflict or other, something in the sub quadrant.  That contradiction <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200991\">is definitely one that I often embody with the person that I\u2019m grappling with in any given moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: We should stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: So I\u2019ll see you on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
