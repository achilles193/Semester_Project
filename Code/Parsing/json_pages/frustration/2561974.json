I had to do a three hour drive to Taylorville to visit Penelope. I drove with Mary. Three hour drive back, you know...

(LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: You know, I just kind of set my boundaries up front, you know, going in to it. Just kind of like, \u201cYeah, you know, I\u2019m in this really guarded place and, you know, I\u2019m not going to be able to go too deep with, you know, conversations and really just felt like I\u2019m...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">I can\u2019t remember wording. I can\u2019t... You know, I can only kind of remember the gist of the conversation but, you know, I just kind of put that out there up front and... Basically said, you know, because, you know, of course everything was back to normal or everything was fine getting into the car and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D1\">going down to... And it\u2019s like I\u2019m feeling like the beaten dog, kind of skittish because I just had to endure, you know, like this hour long unleashing of all of this really ugly negative stuff the last time we got out of marriage counseling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">So when we got to Taylorville, my daughter\u2019s boyfriend has this dog that they rescued from a shelter.

But, you know, I really had a chance to kind of like open up and it\u2019s like, \u201cThis has been my experience of what life without physical and emotional intimacy has been like for a long time.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">Kind of laying out the pattern of, \u201cWe started to go the route of helping her deal with this issue when it came to light, you know, whatever, twelve, fifteen years ago.\u201d And, you know, kind of like, \u201cWell, I was kind of the guy, at that point, who was there to stand by her and help her and that kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">of thing.\u201d You know, again, I\u2019m not 100% sure if I said this in the session or if we talked about it in the car on the way home or whatever.

It\u2019s like... I got the message that I was one who had a problem for wanting to have a physical relationship. You know? I kept getting that message over and over and over and, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">you know, everything just spiraling down to... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">You know, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: How was that received in the session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Well, the counselor was like, \u201cWow.\u201d You know, there was almost kind of like, \u201cWow. You\u2019ve endured seven years without any physical, you know, emotional, physical or emotional in your...\u201d He said, \u201cMost marriages wouldn\u2019t have lasted that long.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: How did that feel for you to be validated like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: It was just like, \u201cOh, thank you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Somebody thinks I\u2019m not crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well, you know, as I said, I told you, nobody... That is, your expectations for physical and emotional intimacy are so normal. How was your... How did Mary respond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well, that was like grabbing onto the third wheel. You know? It was... (PAUSE) And then, it was kind of like towards the last ten minutes of the session that we started talking a little bit more about, you know, the sexual abuse piece. And, you know, she got, you know, really defensive and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B1\">could sense that, you know, what was going on in her eyes was the same kind of thing that I\u2019ve sensed every time that we\u2019ve ever attempted to broach that topic. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">There\u2019s just like this, you know... There is a... I can\u2019t necessarily describe it but there is a physically different look in her face, you know, just terror.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: And so, you know, she was really getting worked up into an anger and it\u2019s like, you know... And all of this stuff was coming out. It\u2019s like... And starting to unleash that stuff on me in terms of like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you would turn out to be this guy and it\u2019s really just all about sex.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">And it just like... I\u2019m like... So, part of me is like feeling like, \u201cWell, at least the counselor is being able to hear all of this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Earlier in the session, he had kind of alluded to the... He had brought up some scriptural passages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Okay. How was that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Well, for me, I\u2019m like, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. How odd the way he didn\u2019t kind of check in regarding your religious affiliation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: He did. And like it\u2019s spelled out on the page, you know, it\u2019s like... And, you know, it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m kind of not going there with the Christian church anymore and, you know, I\u2019m kind of into Taoism now.\u201d And it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Still kind of a misread.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: But he\u2019s like, you know, and probably in Mary\u2019s favor read a little differently but, you know, he\u2019s coming from his own kind of evangelical bend or whatever. And I don\u2019t know exactly. But he felt comfortable saying that, you know, \u201cEphesians 4 or 5, you know, says a man shall leave his mother... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">This is the way God intended marriage to be.\u201d And I\u2019m like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Oh boy. How was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Well, Mary... You know, Mary wasn\u2019t taking that too well at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: So that was pretty much a train wreck. After that, she\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, no... We... That\u2019s not going to work anymore.\u201d So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Wow.

So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Okay.

I\u2019ve got full court press going today. It\u2019s like, \u201cDid you find another counselor? Did you find another counselor? Well, here\u2019s a name, so and so suggested. They went to counseling with this person.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I asked Silas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:09:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: I did. And he had actually talked about some folks? No. I\u2019ve heard of them before because I bought their damn book like twelve or fifteen years ago and sat on the therapist, Dan Lewis. It was the name that he gave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: But they\u2019re in Detroit and I remember that, you know, when Mary and I... You know, I suggested that we kind of work through that book. It\u2019s like, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Alright. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: You know, any of those books. It\u2019s like Getting the Love You Want... Yeah. Blah, blah, blah. It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Let me see if I can get some names for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Well, there\u2019s one person... I went ahead and made an appointment. It\u2019s somebody local down, you know, in the (inaudible) and it\u2019s just like... You know, but part of me is really rooted right now in this place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like... I will go. And it\u2019s on the fifteenth so it\u2019s like next Tuesday or something. I will go but, you know, the place where I\u2019m at is still one of, \u201cHey. You know what? I\u2019m feeling no pressure here at all to move anything along in any direction. And I still am in the same place I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C91\">was three weeks ago.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve got nothing I\u2019m bringing to this.

Where would you kind of describe where you are over this whole idea of marriage and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: You know, today and, again, it\u2019s just taken me such a long, maybe not all that long time but just, you know... I know that there is still a knot here in my stomach. And I think that knot in my stomach is just being able to say the words, you know, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: You know?

It\u2019s just that I know that there\u2019s still that little knot down here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s kind of like, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s not going to go away until it comes out.\u201d You know? I get that.

I think yes. But I\u2019m like, \u201cYou ought to know what you know.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Sure. And I think that you\u2019ve given it... This is a process of years. The end part of the process happened quickly. But this is a process that you\u2019ve been working through for years within.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: Unfortunately, yeah, not working on it with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: No. But there was no safety for you to do that and you weren\u2019t ready to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: But this... So when you say, \u201cHave you given it enough time,\u201d well, you will be the determiner of that. But, you know, it doesn\u2019t take much time if you know and you haven\u2019t varied in that statement for the last three weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">I think you need to give it whatever time that you need but that is your... If that is your truth, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be whether it\u2019s not or a year from now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so part of me feels like, you know, stepping back into this place, you know, stepping off the path and stepping over into this place, it\u2019s like, \u201cHey, you know, I\u2019m here. And, you know, other people can come and check me out if they want to and they can decide whether or not I\u2019m Don <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F71\">Quixote tilting at windmills or if I\u2019m just a guy who has made a decision in a different direction. I\u2019ll leave it up to you to decide.

What does that mean you have to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Well, it means that, you know, that I\u2019ve got to share the house with the uncomfortable feelings and I don\u2019t really want to engage in any discussion. You know, I want to get some work done and I don\u2019t want to deal with this shit right now. That is where I\u2019m at. So, you know, when she\u2019s not there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201071\">the garage is empty, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: Sure.

You know, the transformation even physically in you, your expressions when you talk about it, has been pretty phenomenal. I mean, I almost wish I had a camera so you could see this week where you are. Do you feel what that is? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: I think I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: I think I can. You know, I know that there was a lot of, not necessarily in this session, but I know I was really identifying with like, \u201cWho the hell thought it would be a good idea to put this really depressing statue of Paul Bunyan on the way in and out of this place.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Oh, the old Paul Bunyan. We\u2019ve had jokes about that statue for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: I\u2019m like nothing says \u201cAcademic Success\u201d like that statue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just like...

You know, so heavy and guarded and protected. Now I\u2019m like, yeah, you know what? I\u2019ve got this image. I don\u2019t know if I shared this last week or not but I shared this realization that the wounded child that I\u2019m dealing with is not a five year old child. It\u2019s a two year old child. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: Tell me about being two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: It\u2019s when I had my surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: Tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: And I started to have some, you know, some of those memories came back. Not that I had... I remembered them as a kid and I... They\u2019ve been a part of my life so it\u2019s not like this, you know, buried memory that came back. But I recognize that I had this... And, you know, what I don\u2019t have is a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201271\">lot of information like why did they have to wait until I was two to do the surgery, kind of little corrective surgery that needed to be done. I am not sure about all of that. But I do remember, you know, being left alone overnight in the hospital. And I do remember being at my grandmother\u2019s house after <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201272\">the surgery was over. Now I don\u2019t know how long. But knowing that it was still new because I know that my mom had to put on some kind of salve or medication or something. And I was trying to tell my grandmother about it and my mom was scolding me for talking about it. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: We don\u2019t talk about your penis? We don\u2019t talk about... Ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: Sex. I mean, that\u2019s just my family. We don\u2019t talk about this ever. So it\u2019s like, that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s going back to being two. That\u2019s not five. This is going back to being two. So all the sudden that image of this five year old that I have been parenting or taking care of, suddenly became two years old and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, now this is a completely different feel.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: Sure. I mean, in some ways, I mean, it breaks my heart to have a two year old... And I can\u2019t imagine being two trying to describe what hurts you which is a very normal thing and two year olds have some words but not all words. And you learning at two, after being on earth two years, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201311\">we don\u2019t talk about, being shamed at two. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20130-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20130-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Shamed and two and, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d and not knowing... And then not having language for it and not knowing really much about that at all until I was like sixteen or seventeen years old and I\u2019m just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re left out in the cold to make sense of it on your own. But at two... I mean, how devastating is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. It\u2019s like, \u201cWow, this is even deeper than in a lot of ways...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like, now I have this image of this mother lioness. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got this two year old and I know that the two year old represents, you know my vulnerability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like, yeah, \u201cYou know what? This vulnerability only gets shared with a handful of really trusted select people and we ain\u2019t going to get hurt again.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019re protecting the two year old that didn\u2019t get protected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s like... So now, when I think about that marriage relationship, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re not going there again.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Well, not only that but, I mean, unfortunately sometimes your vulnerability and your partner\u2019s vulnerability can help to heal one another. But yours and Mary\u2019s vulnerabilities were sort of similar and they just rubbed each other the wrong way. She couldn\u2019t... Of course, you\u2019re... I\u2019m thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201491\">that you\u2019re that guy that wants sex while, you know, that\u2019s a compliment. I mean, when the man stops wanting sex from his wife, that\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s the problem. The problem is not wanting sex with your wife. Right? And to be painted... So to take this image of you at two being told, \u201cSomething\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201492\">wrong with you. We don\u2019t talk about that,\u201d at two, you know, which is what enabled you to stay so silent about it in your marriage for so long... Because, again, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about this. Something\u2019s wrong with you that you want this,\u201d which is ridiculous. Right? So that\u2019s where we are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then that\u2019s... Yeah. Right. Exactly. That\u2019s the, for better... You know, not that I really understand these words but that\u2019s my schema. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s heartbreaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: And such a lie. I mean, such a lie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: You know, I mean, if you think about it, I mean, it\u2019s just so wrong. All of these... You know, the ideas that, you know... So, for example, you know, my two year old... I... She calls her vagina and vagina because I want her to know the proper words. And not to get too graphic, but I\u2019m changing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201551\">her, she\u2019s like, \u201cTouch.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cFine.\u201d You know, for her, an elbow and a vagina are the same thing. They don\u2019t know the difference. Right? But so at two, she knows touching whatever, her toes, her ear, her vagina is perfectly okay and yet, at two, you learned, \u201cDon\u2019t touch it.

You think that deep down underneath all of this, you\u2019re unlovable and that once people get to know who you are, they\u2019ll never be able to love you. Right? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Because you have this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah. This thing and I\u2019m a bad person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s all about sex. And sex is bad. And then you have your wife saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. I mean, we grew up in the Christian family. Like sex is bad. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Right. And then you marry someone who was abused by, hurt by sex. Right? You know? It does make me wonder how you guys were able to have what I\u2019m assuming and, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, a health sex life enough to produce three children early on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I think it was subconscious that it was like, \u201cI need to submit to do this in order to get children.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: You know, she got as a message about sex from growing up as a kid, it\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s just your duty.

Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: So, you know, but... You know, it was the kind of thing that sex was not something that you just...

You know, let\u2019s just clear away any moral or ethical boundaries. Right? Just for the purposes of fantasy. What do you think it would be like for you to have sex with another woman? Right? I\u2019m not recommending this. But just kind of... I think that your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A11\">fantasy life has even taken a huge hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: What...

(PAUSE) Whatever it might have been 27 years ago...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20205\">THERAPIST: But, you know, it\u2019s interesting because you\u2019re not... It\u2019s a fair question because when you first came in here a couple of months ago, the first thing that came out of your mouth was, \u201cI took vows. I am obligated.\u201d Right?

And it\u2019s like I\u2019m looking at whatever, you know, who knows... Maybe we get one more day on the planet. But, you know, if I\u2019m looking at statistics, you know, I... You know, there\u2019s a statistical chance that I get a few more years on the planet.

I have to laugh because when we talked about quitting the choir before, you\u2019re like, \u201cNo way.\u201d And you quit. You didn\u2019t even... \u201cYou quit?\u201d \u201cOh yeah.

Damn Seamus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s like if I\u2019m going to be in my truth, the only...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">THERAPIST: You just beat the hell out of that truth. \u201cOh no. I\u2019ve been done with that for years.\u201d (LAUGHTER) So how did you quit and when did you quit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">CLIENT: I just didn\u2019t go back. Well, I mean, it was... It was the marriage counseling thing. It was... I think I had a legitimate excuse the one week. But it was like coming back down and just being yelled at for an hour on the way back down. And it was like that\u2019s church choir night. And it\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202311\">\u201cYeah. I\u2019m pretty much not going there.\u201d (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">CLIENT: I went home and it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.

But I knew that I was going to be done because I had warned...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Sure. But do you understand that you\u2019ve changed a lifetime pattern here in a matter of a month?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">THERAPIST: You know, and I mean, and it\u2019s... And I recognize the difficult painful part of that. But I\u2019m also very proud of you and you should be proud of yourself because you\u2019re just not going the disingenuous thing anymore. You\u2019re just not going it. You know, the choir was never for you. You were <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F1\">willing to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">CLIENT: At some point it was but it\u2019s not anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">CLIENT: It hasn\u2019t been for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">THERAPIST: You know, it\u2019s like going to the dinner, the faculty dinner with your wife.

Because it\u2019s not the truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And the message I got on that was, \u201cWell, you just go and do those things because you\u2019re my husband.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024F\">THERAPIST: Well, but you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20251\">CLIENT: And I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20253\">THERAPIST: Right. You did for 27 years. But now it\u2019s just like nails on a chalkboard. It\u2019s... You know, you do just do those things as part of a marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20255\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20257\">THERAPIST: But what we\u2019re looking at is not really a marriage for you anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20259\">CLIENT: Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025B\">THERAPIST: Right. So the rules... Those same rules for what you just do don\u2019t apply in the same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s kind of like... Yeah. I stepped off the stage. You know, I know it. I get it. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what? The pretense is done here. I\u2019m done. You know, you can go on with this game if you want to. I\u2019m just not in the play anymore. I\u2019m over here. I\u2019m sitting here.\u201d You know, and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2025D1\">like, \u201cMake all the demands you want. But I\u2019m right here. And that\u2019s it.\u201d You know, and I\u2019m like... (SIGH) So I know that that\u2019s got to sounds really... I know that there\u2019s a big part of me that just like, \u201cWow. You know...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025F\">THERAPIST: Wow what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20261\">CLIENT: I... (PAUSE) I know that that probably looks really, really awful on the outside to some people. You know? And I know that it\u2019s got to be completely and utterly confusing to Mary who doesn\u2019t get it at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20263\">You know, it\u2019s just like, you know, something seriously is wrong and I get that. It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, you just changed everything. You just turned it all on its head in the matter of about a month and it\u2019s like...\u201d (PAUSE) So? But, you know, to kind of get back to that question of how\u2019s that making you feel...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20262-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20262-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">CLIENT: You know, I was all knotted up with anxiety last week about that issue. I\u2019m like not right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">THERAPIST: What made the shift for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">CLIENT: I think a lot of it has to do with just stepping out of it, just recognizing, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t have to feel pressured to feel like I\u2019ve got to make a decision right now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">THERAPIST: Absolutely not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">CLIENT: And so I\u2019m just stepping out. I\u2019m just stepping out of the game. You know, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhatever.\u201d So we\u2019ll see where it goes. You know? (PAUSE) So there was, you know... In my word, in my interpretation, you know... (PAUSE) You know, we were driving down to Taylorville. She\u2019s like, \u201cWell...\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F1\">I give her the spiel about being really guarded and it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s not a hell of a lot of trust here. So I\u2019m not expecting...\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, I feel like anything that is going to touch the kind of emotional hot button issues I think ought to be done in the presence of a counselor <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F2\">as opposed to us like going there without, you know, some help.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">So, you know, I was like... I said my peace and said, you know, where I was going to go and what I was going to do and not do. And then she said, \u201cWell, okay. But, you know, I just need you to know that, you know, the conversation or our time in counseling up there got me thinking that, you know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202711\">maybe I had been wrong, you know, and I really, you know, feel like maybe I need to deal with this issue.\u201d And I\u2019m like, you know, just hiding... Not hiding but just being in this place of being really guarded and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. Whatever. Good luck with that.\u201d So I know that there\u2019s just not... I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202712\">just now that there\u2019s still a lot of hurt there that I just still can\u2019t even be in that place of compassion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">CLIENT: If she\u2019s being serious about that, then it\u2019s like, you know, \u201cCould you show a little compassion? Could you...\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cWhatever.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">THERAPIST: Well, you don\u2019t trust, you know... I mean, it sounds like again a desperate measure to hold onto things. It might be different if she actually does seek her own counseling and you see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20279\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, she send me a text that was like, \u201cI left a message at a therapist\u2019s office.\u201d So it\u2019s like, \u201cWhatever. Whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027B\">It\u2019s like... (LAUGHTER) You know... I guess, you know, that people can drastically change obviously. You know, I\u2019ve drastically... Maybe. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve drastically changed or if I\u2019m just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027D\">THERAPIST: I just think that we brought out what was in...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027F\">CLIENT: I finally just got... I just found a voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20281\">THERAPIST: Your own voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20283\">CLIENT: Yeah. And when I was finally able to speak, you know, the word that came out was, \u201cEnough.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20285\">THERAPIST: And it was pretty clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20287\">CLIENT: You know, and... So, for her, it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, great. If you can go get some counseling and you can change all that up... Again, where I\u2019m at today is even if you changed it all up, I\u2019ve got lots of years of shit that I\u2019m sitting here with. It\u2019s like I can forgive but, you know, the way we <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202871\">move forward in relationships with forgiveness, it\u2019s like... You kind of remember, you know, what the hell happened so that you don\u2019t get hurt again.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20286-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20286-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20289\">It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t forgive and move on but like we can move being friends or we can move on being, you know, parents, whatnot and we\u2019ve figured out how to do that pretty well over the years. But it\u2019s like we never really figured out how to be intimate marriage partners. And I\u2019d like to figure that <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202891\">out with somebody that has the capacity to do that. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028B\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that like to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D\">CLIENT: For me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20291\">CLIENT: (SIGH) It\u2019s great to be able to say it. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m yet at a place to be able to say it to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20293\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20295\">CLIENT: I feel like, again, it\u2019s probably what this is right here. It\u2019s like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20297\">And I suppose that I\u2019m also giving myself time. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, when the time is right, you\u2019ll know it. It\u2019ll be right.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t have to happen tomorrow. It\u2019s like, \u201cGive yourself a break, dude.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20299\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t have to happen tomorrow, six months from now, or a year from now. It\u2019s going to happen when you\u2019re ready for it to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, I mean... (SIGH) I had a great little conversation with my little sister last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029D\">THERAPIST: Because there are four boys and one girl. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029F\">CLIENT: She\u2019s eleven years younger than I am and she just went through a divorce. She was married for 20 years to a guy who was kind of a jerk. And I was really sad when they married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A1\">THERAPIST: You were sad when they got married because you knew he was a jerk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A5\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me a little bit about that? That really touches you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A7\">CLIENT: Well, I had really been working on trying to build her self-esteem to get her go to college and get her out of, help her climb over the walls of the little town and get out of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A9\">But she ended up, you know, chasing after somebody who would bolster up her self-esteem, looking desperately for somebody to bolster her self-esteem. She found this guy who ended up being the jerk I thought he was going to be. So finally, she found her voice and had enough and... Yeah. They ended up <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202A91\">getting a divorce. But, at any rate, she had known. I had gone on and had this conversation with my folks and they live across the backyard from each other. So I knew that my mom and she are really close. I knew they would talk. I didn\u2019t have a chance to talk to my little sister. So last night just <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202A92\">happened to be the night. We talked on the phone for about a half an hour. Yeah. It was amazing that, you know, she was just in the same place and just confirming a lot of those things I was feeling for myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AB\">It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. What the hell? Step out. You know? You take it at your own speed. You know?\u201d So it\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, you found your voice and...\u201d Maybe in a little bit different language. You know, we\u2019re not... She\u2019s not saying, you know, an authentic life. She\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to be real.\u201d (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AD\">THERAPIST: But, you know, what\u2019s interesting is that you\u2019re not only getting pretty consistent outside validation but your siblings, from everything you\u2019ve said, are going through, have been through something similar, right, with self-esteem issues in their own lives, kind of getting to this place where <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202AD1\">you\u2019re with somebody for 20 plus years and then looking at it again. I mean, that\u2019s pretty, if you look at it from a family systems perspective, that\u2019s pretty significant stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N202AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B1\">THERAPIST: I mean, you know, so it\u2019s not just you who got the message. You were just the first one because you were the first born. But it went all the way through the family line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. There\u2019s plenty of those issues there. We\u2019d make an interesting study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B5\">THERAPIST: But how painful for you all because it didn\u2019t bring the siblings closer together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B7\">CLIENT: Interestingly enough though, I got a text yesterday from my brother. Now my three younger brothers have always been kind of tight and I\u2019ve kind of been the odd man out. But I got invited to the brothers weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B9\">THERAPIST: The brothers weekend. Do tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202BB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just that the three of them have, you know, gotten together and had a weekend or an evening and just kind of hung out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202BD\">THERAPIST: And are they all down state?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202BF\">CLIENT: Well, they\u2019re over by Dunlap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202C1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202C3\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve never gotten an official invite to come out to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202C5\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202C7\">CLIENT: But I think that probably through my talking with my brother Bill and recognizing, shit, we\u2019re all in the same boat together... I\u2019m guess that\u2019s why I got the invite. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202C9\">THERAPIST: How do you feel about the invite?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202CB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202CD\">THERAPIST: No. Do you want to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202CF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D1\">THERAPIST: Oh good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I want to check in on these guys. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve got war stories to tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D5\">THERAPIST: You do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D7\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like... You know, my brother Bill\u2019s been doing marriage counseling for about a year and, you know, it kind of looks like they might salvage a relationship out of that. I don\u2019t know about my other two brothers. But I know where I\u2019m feeling I\u2019m at right now. So it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D9\">THERAPIST: When is the brother\u2019s weaned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DB\">CLIENT: This coming Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DD\">THERAPIST: Okay. So you\u2019re going to go down to Dunlap?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DF\">CLIENT: I think so. I think that\u2019s when it is. I\u2019ll have to check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E3\">CLIENT: But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E5\">THERAPIST: And do you guys go camping? What do you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E7\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll just hang at my brother\u2019s house. He\u2019s got a bar downstairs. I\u2019ll sure we\u2019ll just drink too much and, for me, that\u2019s like one beer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E9\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Enjoy yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m looking forward to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202ED\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EF\">CLIENT: Getting out of... And it\u2019s like I recognize that like her work schedule, her church schedule, her life has been on the weekends which has kept me, you know... Because I\u2019ve been the good puppy that\u2019s come along to church all the time. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve denied myself relationships with my family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F1\">THERAPIST: Why do you think you chose to quote, unquote \u201cbe the good puppy and go along?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F3\">CLIENT: (SIGH) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F5\">THERAPIST: Because she didn\u2019t keep you from them. You chose to go along with what was said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. But you know what? There was a pretty strong message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F9\">THERAPIST: Sure there was. Yes there absolutely was. But what made you choose to go along?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FB\">CLIENT: Well, because I wasn\u2019t going to make her unhappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FD\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FF\">CLIENT: Not being there was going to make her...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20301\">THERAPIST: No. What is the consequence to making Mary unhappy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20303\">CLIENT: Oh, that, you know, I don\u2019t exist. You know, that\u2019s not exactly the right word but it\u2019s like, \u201cYou won\u2019t like me anymore. You know, I need you to like me.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20305\">And it\u2019s like... I think it like kind of became this surrogate in a way. It\u2019s like if the physical relationship\u2019s going to hell, the only thing I\u2019ve got left for you to like me is to do this church thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20304-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20304-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20307\">THERAPIST: But even that was empty for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20309\">CLIENT: Eventually...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Because even the liking was not enough because that\u2019s the kiss at the door, goodbye, a pat on the head. I mean, the liking is not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030D\">CLIENT: So... (SIGH) Yeah. There\u2019s all of that. You know, there\u2019s... So, yeah, any opportunity I can get... And eventually, it became like, \u201cI\u2019m just not going to church anymore. The choir\u2019s not happening. I\u2019m just not going to church.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030F\">You know, so slowly, you know, I\u2019ve been eroding that over time. But, yeah, no. It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20311\">THERAPIST: What was it like to attend church when you don\u2019t practice Christianity anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20313\">CLIENT: It was just mostly sitting there are trying to be in that place of mindfulness. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll just turn this into a mindfulness activity.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Health insurance. Let me just focus on the fact that I\u2019m getting my health insurance through, you know, my wife working at <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203131\">this place.\u201d It\u2019s just like... (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20315\">THERAPIST: But you did that week after week. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20317\">CLIENT: And sometimes multiple times a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20319\">THERAPIST: Yeah. For something that is not within your belief system anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031B\">CLIENT: No. And, you know, not that I\u2019m not a spiritual person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031D\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re a very spiritual person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031F\">CLIENT: But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20321\">THERAPIST: Just not a practice of Christianity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20323\">CLIENT: Right. So yeah...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20325\">THERAPIST: You know, what I find... Something not now but eventually we have to look at. The contract was so set for so long. And there are parts that you agreed to that, you know, I think in marriage we all agree to parts of the contract we don\u2019t like. But that you don\u2019t like and sort of even went <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203251\">against your own belief system about things. Right? Which is why you have all of the emotion around this now where you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d because for years... But both of you agreed to that contract. Right? For better or for worse you sort of agreed to the contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20327\">CLIENT: I mean, that was kind of an implied contract because we didn\u2019t go by the standard wording. We actually wrote our own vows and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what those things were anymore.\u201d And it\u2019s like... So it\u2019s kind of like to throw around the standard language of the marriage contract, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203271\">it\u2019s like, we didn\u2019t abide by the standard language when we got married. So what is it that, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20329\">It\u2019s like... Well, it\u2019s just kind of this... You know, this implied, understood that marriage is forever and you\u2019re stuck in it, you\u2019re stuck with me forever. That\u2019s just the implied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032B\">THERAPIST: You know, I have a good friend of mine who is probably in his later fifties, a work colleague and a friend who used to be a Catholic priest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032D\">CLIENT: Uh oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032F\">THERAPIST: Left that, became a Buddhist, married a Jewish woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20331\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20333\">THERAPIST: And I asked him, you know, \u201cWhat happened there?\u201d And he just said, \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t me anymore. I just...\u201d Of course, he talked a little bit about hypocrisy and those things. And he said, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I felt like a fraud. So I left, you know, and...\u201d He\u2019s got this really <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203331\">long ponytail and, you know, he\u2019s like, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20332-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20332-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20335\">It sort of strikes a bit similar here that you just can\u2019t do it anymore. When I say the contract, I sort of thing most married couples have an implied contract that you come to about the agreement that\u2019s most often not discussed about things, the way things are going to be, the way we\u2019re going to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203351\">things. And sometimes you go along to get along because it makes life easier. But you did it in ways that compromised yourself so deeply that now you just can\u2019t abide by it anymore, right, even attending on a regular multi week basis church services for a faith that you no longer subscribe to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20337\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I would say when I subscribed early on, I was on board.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20339\">THERAPIST: Right. Sure. But there was no conversation about recognizing, you know... I mean, there were some jabs here and there. But your belief system had changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2033B\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, there were attempts at that and attempts to try. But it\u2019s like, \u201cNope.\u201d We\u2019re not going there. We don\u2019t discuss that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2033D\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019ve been told multiple times in your life about what we don\u2019t discuss. \u201cBut as long as you attend church, I\u2019m going to ignore this Taoism thing and you go... As long as we\u2019re married and that\u2019s what it looks like...\u201d Right? I mean, the themes are pretty incredible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2033F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s all about the facade of it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20341\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20343\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s about maintaining this grand illusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20345\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20347\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m done with that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20349\">THERAPIST: Right. But the message is that you\u2019ve been told for your whole life about what we don\u2019t talk about don\u2019t apply anymore.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2034B\">CLIENT: No really. And... (PAUSE) Yeah. So there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. Well, you know what? I understand my complicity in all of this and I know that the way that I reacted to things... But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I know what I know and I want what I want and I\u2019m done with what <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2034B1\">I\u2019m done with.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2034D\">THERAPIST: When you look back on this, do you think you will blame yourself or... \u201cWhy did I stay so long\u201d \u201cWhy did I do these things?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2034F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20351\">THERAPIST: Good. Tell me why not. I like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20353\">CLIENT: No. I feel like, you know, as much as I may not necessarily feel this now, I think cognitively I describe too... You know, it\u2019s like you did the best you could do with what you had at the time and things... You know, you were ready when you were ready. It\u2019s everything that I would tell everybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203531\">else. So I think that it\u2019s starting to sink in. I think I can be there with it and not beat myself up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20355\">THERAPIST: I see that. And that wouldn\u2019t have been what you would have said month ago. That\u2019s pretty incredible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20357\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like... You know? I\u2019ve got three great kids. I\u2019ve got three really good kids out of this. There\u2019s plenty of other positives that I can mine through this ash heap and find. I may not be able to see them today. You know? But all of that brought me to where I\u2019m at today. And it\u2019s like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203571\">kind of liking where I\u2019m at today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20359\">THERAPIST: I see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035B\">CLIENT: Even though it may suck a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035D\">THERAPIST: Right. But you wear it well, you know, and considering how difficult it was for you to sort of put on and keep on in the first place. Don\u2019t take it off again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035F\">CLIENT: No. I ain\u2019t taking it off. So, I know that we have almost no time left. But it\u2019s like one of the other issues that I know that I\u2019m kind of dealing with is the, this growing sense of like, \u201cWell, shit. There are other relationships that are possible.\u201d And it\u2019s like now I\u2019m feeling like am I in <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2035F1\">the same place of not knowing how to deal with anger and rage, you know... I don\u2019t know. Appropriately? I don\u2019t even know if those are the right words, you know, because I feel like in some ways, being able to deal with these heightened emotions is kind of like new territory for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N2035E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20361\">THERAPIST: So let me make sure I understand. You\u2019re obviously forming deeper more significant relationships with classmates talking about personal things, friendships are growing, you know, and maybe even looking to the future and romantic relationships. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cCan I handle all of these emotions <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203611\">that have come up? Can I handle my own anger, my own pain?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20363\">CLIENT: Can I handle... I mean, it\u2019s like... I recognize it as like I\u2019m trying to stay in some place of authenticity. It\u2019s like I\u2019m holding anger over here, I\u2019m holding this relationship shit that I don\u2019t know what to do with. I\u2019m holding... Wow, really close friendship. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, the authentic <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203631\">part of me doesn\u2019t want to let that go.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, why the hell should I?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20365\">THERAPIST: Are you having romantic feelings for one of these individual friendships?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20367\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m afraid so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20369\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s what it\u2019s sounding like. And so your mind is kind of turning towards...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2036B\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like... Well, are you even trying in this other relationship anymore? Were you even trying in the first place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2036D\">THERAPIST: Well, for 27 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2036F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s just like... So there\u2019s that tension or that conflict now that I\u2019m like, \u201cOh fuck.\u201d (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20371\">THERAPIST: Well, you know, it\u2019s a different place to be. You know, it\u2019s kind of a bit more excited place to be in some ways. I was going to ask about that. I was like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s sounding like this to me.\u201d You know, that, in some ways, will work itself out. Right? So you\u2019re in the tough place of kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203711\">of looking at what you think you might want over here and still kind of embroiled in this relationship over here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20373\">CLIENT: Which is why I\u2019m like in the middle now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20375\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But some of this will... You know, some of this is going to take time to resolve itself. Are you afraid, you know, concerned that you might kind of act on this sexually or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20377\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20379\">THERAPIST: No. Just become more attached emotionally?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2037B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2037D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2037F\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s like I know that I\u2019ve been the guy in the desert for so long that it\u2019s like somebody offers me a drink of water...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20381\">THERAPIST: Sure. Or a pitcher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20383\">CLIENT: I\u2019m like... You know, it\u2019s like I can sit here and have an intimate conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20385\">THERAPIST: And be affirmed as well. Yeah. Well, you know, can we sort of look at that next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20387\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20389\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2038B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sure that it will still be there next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2038D\">THERAPIST: I think so. You know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2038F\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m just... In the meantime, it\u2019s just like recognizing that that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m sitting in too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20391\">THERAPIST: Yes. And in the meantime kind of recognizing that this is sort of healthy part of you has kind of been unleashed. And now you\u2019re kind of hungry to go looking for the intimacy that you have been denied for so long. And so, you know, all of these are really healthy things. They just are. Unfortunately, <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203911\">you\u2019re going to sit in that too. But it\u2019s exciting in some ways to kind of see that there\u2019s another world that could be opened to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N20390-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20390-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561974\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20393\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20395\">THERAPIST: And that you refuse to go back to the box of not being in touch with your emotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20397\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20399\">THERAPIST: So whatever they are...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2039B\">CLIENT: I have been sitting with that too. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, dude. You\u2019re not going back there either. So the bottom line is if you\u2019re going to shut off that emotion, then you\u2019re just going back into the same patterns you were dealing with before.\u201d So I know that I don\u2019t want to go there either. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2039D\">THERAPIST: Okay. So we\u2019ll look at that. I want to hear more about that.

Where are you with the whole doctorate thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203A7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to turn in the application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203A9\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll go run screaming off the cliff and see what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203AD\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s a great idea.
