when Daisy tried to tell me that the gift certificate to Dunkin Donuts that she\u2019d given me three months ago was going to be payment for me grading student essays on my own time. I told her that wasn\u2019t going to work for me. (Laughs) Like, this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">not how it works. (Laughs) I sort of had it in my mind, not sort of \u2013 I definitely had it in my mind to stay for the next three weeks, basically through the end of this SAT class. It\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s going to be able to happen. Like sorry, Daisy, that\u2019s not how it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That\u2019s kind of sleazy of her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. She\u2019s totally sleazy. The best part was I saw it coming. She gave me \u2013 she included a gift card in my paycheck for the first month. I had two thoughts \u2013 actually three thoughts. The first one was \u2013 \u2018why the fuck would I want a Dunkin Donuts gift card? I hate Dunkin Donuts.\u2019 The second <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">one was, \u2018well, that\u2019s a nice gesture.\u2019 And the third one was, \u2018she\u2019s totally going to use this.\u2019 (Laughs) Sure enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk) donuts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: But she knows.

She was saying that she wants to start working freelance or start working for an editor for other people. And she was like, \u2018should I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">work for free?\u2019 And I was like, no you should not work for free. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(Pause): [00:03:16 00:03:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s unclear to me whether I will be able to get a good night\u2019s sleep for the next week. I want to see how that goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: The heat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: No, no. Tonight I\u2019m taking an all-night bus to the city. Taking an overnight bus. And then Sunday, Saturday night with Candace and Sunday night coming back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I forgot. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: There\u2019s Monday night. And then I work on Tuesday morning. And I never managed \u2013 if I\u2019m getting up \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry. (Unclear) because you told me about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I told you about it. I\u2019m not planning on missing any appointments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m supposed to substitute at 9:30 on Monday anyway. So (unclear). We\u2019ll see how that works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay. All right. Sorry. I was just (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I think that I just referred to it in the same way I just did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re going to sleep on the bus and at Candace\u2019s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just have a real hard time going to bed before 11:30. I also have a real hard time without 8 or 9 hours of sleep. So, whatever. I\u2019ve been doing this not sleeping for the three days a week that I work and then sleeping a whole lot on the weekends. And that sort of works but then sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">of perpetuates (unclear). And then this week, can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m very good at sleeping in cars though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">(Pause): [00:05:33 00:05:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m excited to see Candace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">(Pause): [00:06:02 00:06:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: She apparently planned to brunch out on all you can eat cinnamon rolls which (inaudible).

(inaudible) There was a non-zero chance I could have just slept right through this evening. (Laughs) Even though I got up an hour ago, but it was not easy. And now that James is gone there is nothing in my mind that says like I can\u2019t hit the snooze <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">button more than once because it will wake him up so I just keep on turning it around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">(Pause): [00:07:27 00:07:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I really, really, really (inaudible) weekend. The last couple of days were not so bad. Just feeling like I didn\u2019t have the internal resources to do what I had to do. But yeah, it is, that\u2019s okay. You know, at this point I know that every time I go to tutoring there is a high likelihood I\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">wind up having a fight with Daisy because she\u2019s asked me to do something crazy and I have to tell her, \u2018no, I don\u2019t work for free.\u2019 Or you know, in this case, she eventually said she\u2019d pay me but she said, \u2018could you stay and grade these papers now?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018no, that\u2019s also not going to work.\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">Like, \u2018I have places to be now. You can\u2019t spring that on me.\u2019 I\u2019m like \u2013 it\u2019s so hard for me to hold onto what is reasonable. Like Daisy is kind of easy to deal with in some ways because she\u2019s so out in left field, like it\u2019s so clearly, sleazy as you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: But then some of the things she asks I think, well maybe I should just go ahead and do it. It would be easier to do what she asks than it is to explain why that\u2019s not something that I wanted to do. Then I feel like it\u2019s my own fault for being in the situation and I should have (unclear) beforehand <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(Pause): [00:09:43 00:10:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not so much that I\u2019m afraid to stand up for myself in this situation as that I just get so tired. It becomes more than I \u2013 it becomes more than I can deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">(Pause): [00:10:40 00:11:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure why that is.

Like we kind of devolved into a question and answer period today and like some of these questions I can\u2019t answer <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">because I don\u2019t know and some of these I\u2019m sort of amazed they\u2019re even asking like \u2013 what is the (unclear) to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: This is in Fredericksburg?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So they\u2019re not like in the really serious \u2013 well, like \u2013 you really should talk to your college counselor about this. And they\u2019re like \u2013 what\u2019s that? And I\u2019m like, guidance counselors? That sound familiar? Yes. We have those but they don\u2019t really do that. I\u2019ll bet they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">do.

I told them not to worry that much about that. To take AP s \u2013 not so much because it looks good but then when you get to college you have a lot more flexibility if you have AP credit. But I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I guess college sounds like one of those places where private <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">schools really differ from public schools in ways I hadn\u2019t really expected and like seem obvious so we had two dedicated college counselors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I was just a (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think the guidance counselors see some of that, but in that sort of town or a lot of towns around here they used to get a lot of the kids would also arrange their (inaudible), read their essays, and also make their lists and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.
