I don\u2019t know. (long pause)  I guess I feel like I kind of want to restart. I guess I just feel like I\u2019ve been think on the past side in terms of coming out of allowing things to happen or like proactive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Did you say on the \u201cpast side?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Past it.  (pause) I just feel like I have a lot of things to do, but I\u2019ve kind of been putting them off, not taking control of them. (pause) I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s wrong or what I should do.  I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling like I\u2019m not very good about things and I don\u2019t know what I can do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">anymore or what am I allowing to happen that makes me feel this way.  (long pause) Things just seem complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: How so? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I guess everything, like at work, leads to more things to do or frustrations and not ever feeling satisfied or at the end, left feeling like uneasy or mad at myself for allowing this to happen. I guess I just don\u2019t feel very in control or aware. (pause)  And even \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it makes sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">\u2013 like relationships or friendships, it always seems like I\u2019m left feeling uneasy, not really sure what\u2019s going on. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I think the things that you\u2019re referring to, I would imagine, many of them are things you can actually control; but then I think also that stirs up worries for you that you can\u2019t really control that well either.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right. I guess it\u2019s all these worries. I just feel so limited or numb, kind of afraid to do things or everything bothers me. (pause)  It\u2019s hard not to get upset. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I imagine part of what is uncomfortable with getting upset about it is not just the upset which, of course, doesn\u2019t feel good in itself, but also the sense of vulnerability or the sense that that must mean you\u2019re doing something wrong. I suspect it probably goes along with that.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. I guess it comes off as like I don\u2019t know the game or just insufficient. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Which, I think, when you imagine yourself that way, you also feel terribly critical of yourself for being. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Sometimes, but then mostly I think I just want to withdraw. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to interact with people. I just kind of want to do my own thing. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Seems like it\u2019s much safer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. Or . . . (long pause)  I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just thinking how there are people and tasks, like work stuff getting dumped on you, they all pose a threat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. Spending time with people, even sometimes like Vicki or my dad, always seems bad, like backsliding or something, giving into or allowing myself to be distracted or . . . I don\u2019t know.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I think the way you think about being focused and un-distracted and active has a lot to do with a fantasy about being safe from this really intense anxiety if you don\u2019t interact with people, if you stay on top of things, if you really focus on getting things done.  You won\u2019t be so anxious; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">you\u2019ll be okay. And if you don\u2019t, if you get mixed up with other people or you get off task, it will eat you up or they will eat you up; just the anxiety that comes from that interaction or distraction. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562220\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. And I\u2019m just going to [relax] (ph?) control over . . . I\u2019m not sure. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I guess in my mind, one of the questions is why do the interactions with other people or getting pulled up from what you need to do put you in such danger? Let me be clear, I know how that happens, that you can have an interaction with somebody, like with the post doc, Lolo, where she\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">doing something correctly and it makes you worry and then you worry that it\u2019s going to reflect on you and you\u2019ll get in trouble.  And then you kind of can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s her problem or it\u2019s your problem or where the problem is. I know how it goes, I think, in a general way, but what I mean is it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">not clear to me why it goes those ways that involves so much anxiety and makes you feel so bad. When I say that, I\u2019m not saying it like you have the answer, necessarily. I guess that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m thinking about what you\u2019re struggling with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s just not satisfying or I\u2019m always kind of wanting more or something. I guess it\u2019s just hard for me to enjoy things as they are. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know exactly what it is. (pause) Last night I went out to dinner with a few post docs who used to be in the lab. There were eight <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">of us. I guess I just worried that I\u2019m not doing enough or people are always worried or mad at me or think I\u2019m boring or something.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re going to make of this, but my guess is it\u2019s very hard to tell \u2013 like I think you really go back and forth between experiencing the problem in the other person and in yourself. At first when you said how you\u2019re always wanting more and it\u2019s hard for you to enjoy things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">how they are, in a way there you\u2019re saying \u201cI always find what\u2019s outside wanting and not enough.\u201d But then a bit later you\u2019re talking about you could be boring or had done something wrong, like the problem is you.  I\u2019m not sure what to make of that, but it comes up a lot, I think, that there is this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">kind of switching. I\u2019m aware that at the end of the day you see the problem as being you \u2013 I know that \u2013 but in the moment, it seems like there is a lot of back and forth. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m not contributing enough or pulling my weight to make the experience better and I don\u2019t know how or . . . I don\u2019t know.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Is it that you kind of start out like whatever is happening just isn\u2019t enough, and then you immediately figure that it\u2019s your fault?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I can\u2019t help or I can\u2019t believe the situation or fix the feeling that I have. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: This is going to sound really far out there. I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019m a little bit still on this baby jag from yesterday, listening to what you\u2019re saying. It reminds me of somebody who is pregnant and worried there is a problem with the pregnancy and the thing that reminds me of that is how immediate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">that sense is that oh, my gosh, if there is something wrong with the pregnancy, it must be that my body is not doing something right \u2013 the sense of the stakes being high and the anxiety, and also of almost merging this, a merger, that if there is a problem with the pregnancy, it must be something I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">doing.  Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562220\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: No. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not at all meaning to say that\u2019s on your mind, but there are things that seem like that in what you\u2019re describing. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) I think it\u2019s just a feeling of being inadequate.

It\u2019s just not enough or it\u2019s not good enough. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: I guess it also seems like the project kind of comes to stand in for you, too. You don\u2019t seem so separate from the project, like that\u2019s the thing out there that I didn\u2019t handle quite well enough this time. It seems very close to home, the sense of inadequacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  Yeah, I mean I don\u2019t know what to do about it to gain control over it and do something that makes me feel better about the situation to kind of close off and push myself to do it. (long pause)  I guess I\u2019m just thinking about those people in terms of those that kind of seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">like this is the way I am and not deal with it, but like others who are always doing things and saying they need to work on things. I don\u2019t know.
