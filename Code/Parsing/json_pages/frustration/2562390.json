It\u2019s probably why you find me funny. I bet you if someone was asking you to do a British female accent, that you would probably do the Monty Python female accent. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve done it recently, but a decade ago they were doing surveys of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">that. And they were finding that most males were doing the, hello, Mrs. Grail. \u2018Cause that was what everybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: What is the predictable sound bite?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Does he have a check for $3,000? No. It\u2019s about what my acupuncturist is charging me. I was going to write it out to her. Much better looking than you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure she is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I\u2019m going to get some acupuncture. Apparently, I am damp heat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I think you mentioned this actually, last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So I had my first little pinning session yesterday. And she said she went really easy. But I definitely feel looser. Like, not as tight. [1:45] I feel it more joint and muscularly, but she says everything\u2019s loosening up. The organs and things are flowing or whatever. And then she\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">send me suggested foods to eat and foods not to eat. I don\u2019t understand why Chinese medicine won\u2019t let me eat Chinese food. She\u2019s like, it will, it just has to be steamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s going to be hard with Marcia to diet. It\u2019s funny. I went over there Saturday night. Dropped my dad and stepmom off at the airport and we had a late lunch or, you know, at Manchester Burger. And I wasn\u2019t going to get anything, \u2018cause Marcia was going to cook dinner and I wasn\u2019t hungry. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">So I get the big burger and all that. I was just stuffed. I mean, all I do with my parents is eat. Everything\u2019s a meal. So I get over to her house and she had gone to Trader Joe\u2019s. She\u2019s all excited how she\u2019s going to Trader Joe\u2019s and she\u2019s doing salsa and chips. I said, trust me, I\u2019ll be eating this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">stuff later, but right now \u2013 And actually, I was attempting to show willpower, and I did until much later. I knew it wasn\u2019t going to last for long. [3:21] \u2018Cause she was having a lot of fun with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">She didn\u2019t know that I had thinking about the diet thing or whatever. And she\u2019s literally going through everything she bought at Trader Joe\u2019s, super excited. You want to try this, you know. So finally, I broke down after a couple of hours and I had a bon bon. So, you know, she\u2019s just this little woman <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">who could eat all day long. She\u2019s got a little pouch, but with summer and as much as she walks dogs, you know, that\u2019s not going to hang around. It\u2019s all winter weight. She\u2019s just like a ball of energy. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how much help she\u2019s going to be. [4:14] But I think if I just do simple <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">little things like stop drinking Coke. Stop getting Chinese food without her. I like chow mein, you know, the lighter Chinese foods that don\u2019t have the grease in it, where the darker has all the grease in it. So if I want something light, like chow mein. You know, you put those fried crispy noodles <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">on top. It\u2019s becoming a regular thing. Marcia and I got into a fight. I think they\u2019re productive, though. I think we have \u2013 and it\u2019s rough. This was pretty rough, because she got really pissed off at me. And I just didn\u2019t understand what I was doing wrong. [5:10] We went to a concert and she came up <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F4\">to me and she said, you keep spilling my drink. And I was kind of facing the other way, so I thought maybe I was bumping into her. So I\u2019ll buy you another one. And I was grabbing her. And I remember one instance of grabbing her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">But apparently, I was doing this repeatedly. And the reason she was spilling her drink was, you know. And I kept asking. I\u2019m like, why \u2013 and she asked me to stop being mean? I said, well what am I doing that\u2019s mean? She\u2019s like, well, you keep on spilling my drink and grabbing me. And I didn\u2019t realize <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">that it was all these other things, you know. She was pissed off and didn\u2019t even stay in Andover and left. You know, when I ask you why \u2013 She\u2019s like, I told you. I said, but if I knew, I wouldn\u2019t keep asking you, right? Especially the next day. You know, why, why, why, why? [6:08] And when she finally <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">told me I\u2019m like oh, I\u2019m sorry. She recognizes that we both, you know. And she of course, she\u2019s obsessed with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">I don\u2019t know what her problem is. But she recognizes that we have this difficulty sometimes, talking to each other. And I went over there. We even started arguing about it a little bit, which was good, because it didn\u2019t really escalate or last very long. I finally said, you know, she came over to give <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">me a hug and kiss. I said, you know, it\u2019s not unlike you to get a little too wasted and annoy the hell out of everybody. And she just kind of laughed. [7:04] But I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been, you know, not like I\u2019ve had a bunch of relationships. But I\u2019ve never been in a relationship where there\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">kind of, this conflict. And I think the reason is, especially like with Jess is that I just avoided it. It doesn\u2019t seem. Like this, the next day she wanted never to speak to me again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Maybe the different \u2013 it seems to me difference is that things that happened with Jess was you don\u2019t seem to feel as kind of dominated or shut down with Marcia as you did with Jess. I\u2019m not sure how much of that\u2019s them, how much of that\u2019s you or what. But that\u2019s how I hear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s me. You know, I recognize that now I can get grumpy or drift off or get sad. [8:16] This really had nothing to do with any of that. I think a lot of the other conflict has. I think she\u2019s been better in supporting me when she\u2019s not angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well, you guys had a long talk about that a few weeks ago, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Not long. But she\u2019s definitely making an effort to be a bit more supportive or whatever. But I don\u2019t know. For me, it\u2019s like a rollercoaster. I\u2019m just getting used to it, because it\u2019s been going on for \u2013 ever since I started the whole online dating thing. Even before that. [9:21] It\u2019s not sticking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">with me. That\u2019s my problem, is things stick with me. That\u2019s what happened Thursday night is, she\u2019s always saying, get over it, get over it. And that actually causes me to hold my ground more. And while I don\u2019t like told this \u2013 for her to say get over it, and I\u2019ve asked her not to say it, this is probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">a time where she should have said it. But I just didn\u2019t comprehend what was going on. Hopefully, this getting my stomach and innards and getting back in shape and all this helps. I don\u2019t know. You know, I feel little confused at times. I\u2019m forgetting things very easily. [10:25] Or, in a conversation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">You know, when you\u2019re asking your 73-year-old dad who literally looks like he\u2019s 85 to remind me what we were talking about, you know. I think a lot of that is that I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind now. And I\u2019m definitely handling it so much better.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Work is continuing to \u2013 A guy\u2019s hiring me for a condo conversion. This guy whose landlord was forced by the city to turn his three bedroom into a two bedroom, because when the landlord made it a three bedroom, he counted their apartment as the second means of egress. [11:35] You kind of when <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">you \u2013 and my guy was withholding rent. Kind of when you take a three bedroom and make it a two bedroom, that\u2019s a big breach of quiet enjoyment, quiet enjoyment being your use of the premises. You can\u2019t quite use a three bedroom as you can a two bedroom, especially when four people live there. So it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">was him and his wife and two other guys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">So everybody had their own room. But he\u2019s someone I spoke to several times on the phone. I felt he had a really good case. He just wanted to wait until he moved out. I think a lot of this is the tenants are worried about retaliation, where I\u2019m, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll squash your landlord like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">grape if he tries that. [12:29] People just don\u2019t believe that. So I didn\u2019t know if that was going on with him. But I got an e-mail from him yesterday. This is \u2013 if he was going to, you know, early April. I guess it\u2019s still early April. So he wants me to do the demand letter. So I charge people for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">an hour to do the demand letter. And then, if they want to move forward with litigation, then I ask for the retainer. So I paid off my GAP card. And that would put you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: You know, I realized how your financial planner told you to make your list, I should have sent you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Several different bills, yeah. But you\u2019re high up on the list, because I don\u2019t have a lot of debt. Flo fucked you though. She fucked you big time. Well, she lent me $4,000 and there\u2019s an after school program in Plymouth. And Ian\u2019s good friend who\u2019s Jewish goes there. We\u2019re getting a couple of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">years from starting bar mitzvah stuff. I really want him to go there. It\u2019s really expensive. But it\u2019s like, twice as much as what Jess had been sending him to, arts and crafts or whatever it is. [14:02] And I said to her, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay it. It\u2019s like everything. It\u2019s like, the taxes. I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay it. She still worries that \u2013 Finally, I was like, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay it. She\u2019s like oh, I misunderstood you. So we\u2019re sitting there and it\u2019s $430 a month \u2013 or $410 if by a certain date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">And for me it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t think I have a choice here. I\u2019m not affiliated with the temple. It seems like a very flexible situation where they\u2019ve got a lot of different kids with different backgrounds, some in temple, some are not. Some, you know. So they really do what the kid needs, and meet that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">kid. You know, like if you\u2019re doing a bar mitzvah and you\u2019re not affiliated with the temple or whatever, they\u2019ll get you the resources and help you move along and plan, but I don\u2019t think they actually teach Torah and stuff like that, but they do teach you Hebrew and songs. And understand the prayers. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">And this is the stuff Ian wants to learn. [15:16] I was kind of taken aback by Jess\u2019 solely looking at it solely on dollars. I said, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay for it. She said, I don\u2019t have any money. She\u2019s like, I\u2019m broke. I said, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay for it. She said, what about Lucille\u2019s after school.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">So I was like, jeez, you don\u2019t remember how we had this $7,000 tax bill, not including our estimated taxes and I paid the whole thing and I\u2019m going to be paying your estimated taxes, which finally yesterday she goes, oh. I didn\u2019t understand that\u2019s what you meant. But right now GAP\u2019s out of there. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">the actual next largest debt is the loan on Ian\u2019 life insurance policy. His permanent insurance. I had been making the premium payments, so they\u2019ve been the last couple of years, I was paying them out of the policy. So right now it\u2019s like $1,700. That\u2019s number one on the list. Actually, I\u2019m sorry. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">Faculty Physicians are at $800. But that already has been, you know, the money hasn\u2019t gone out, but it\u2019s going out the door. And then, there\u2019s my credit card and then Flo decided to reduce my debt from $4,000 to $3,000 to help with my debt. So third on the list is Flo. Right behind is the Avi children. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200393\">[17:12] I wouldn\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to have a good year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Apart from what you owe me, I\u2019m glad things are looking up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Apart from what you owe me. Other than the fact that I can\u2019t eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think what I\u2019m going to do is \u2013 you\u2019re tax advantaged. So I think I\u2019m going to just \u2013 I don\u2019t know what my limits are from my Health Savings Account, but just start feeding that thing, \u2018cause now with the acupuncturist and all that. So if there\u2019s money there, I\u2019ll send it to you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">But I\u2019ve got this one \u2013 number one, I\u2019m not remembering to take my afternoon Adderall. And I set an alarm and everything. I don\u2019t even hear it go off. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s going off. It\u2019s like, two or three o\u2019clock that I feel that \u2013 oh, it\u2019s up for the day, because I hadn\u2019t taken the Adderall at noon. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">[18:58] You know, I\u2019ve been fighting through it and getting stuff done. I\u2019ve got this one motion. I don\u2019t know whether I told you about it, the woman who moved out and then they evicted her and got like, $7,000 judgment against her. And she goes to pull her credit to buy a house, and there\u2019s this judgment <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200413\">there three years later. So at the time, you know, if we had fought this six months after it happened, no problem. But the time is a consideration for the court.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Like how long it\u2019s been since the judgment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: So it may even be three years. So I really need to get this fucking thing done, and I just can\u2019t bring myself to sit down and work on it. A lot of it\u2019s \u2018cause I\u2019ve got all this other stuff to do. Part of it\u2019s probably \u2018cause she sends me $50 a week. [19:54] But once again, it\u2019s a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">out of my comfort zone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just a big motion that I haven\u2019t done this type of motion. I probably need to do some research on it. I definitely need to do some research and fax. It\u2019s one of these things where it\u2019s probably not as bad as I think it\u2019s going to be, but I just, you know, can\u2019t get myself to do it. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">I think as I\u2019m getting more involved in being the court, that this kind of thing is going to be a little bit more natural. She has a great case. It\u2019s just the time. Number one, the e-mail, I\u2019m moving out this weekend. The response, I\u2019m showing the apartment to a tenant on Monday. [20:46] That\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">you know, January, February. This guy\u2019s got April, May, June, July, you know to the rest in rent. And first of all, a notice to quit is only valid if it\u2019s received. Now, constable\u2019s notice of service is prima facie evidence. But clearly, this wasn\u2019t received. I don\u2019t have the same argument on the compliant, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200493\">you know, when the filed the lawsuit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">So her notice to quit\u2019s bad, on a separate rule that she never received. Simple fact that she never received it. And I think that e-mail shows that she never received it. But with the complaint, you don\u2019t need to show receipt. You know, last and usual is sufficient. But this guy knew that he could e-mail <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">her or call her on her cell phone, or use the fucking Google and find out her real address, that she didn\u2019t live there. 21:49] So that\u2019s more of a massaged argument I\u2019ve got to try. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve got to do a little research. If you know. I think if you didn\u2019t make a good at faith effort to find <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">out where she was. I mean, if he did and couldn\u2019t\u2019, yeah. Even though he knows she doesn\u2019t live there, that\u2019s the last address. That\u2019s the last usual means. I don\u2019t have to live there. That\u2019s just the last known address. But there\u2019s probably some case law that says he\u2019s got to do a little more. \u2018Cause <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B3\">I\u2019ve had clients where the landlord\u2019s done exactly that. You know, where are you living now? I want to send you your security deposit. Next thing you know, they\u2019re getting a summons and complaint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">So I\u2019m struggling with that. I keep telling her I\u2019m going to get it done. [22:37] I\u2019m lying. I\u2019m making up excuses. Yesterday I told her I had technology problems and can\u2019t get it off the Internet, whatever, the backup. I was just making shit up. I did work on it a little bit. I went to the acupuncturist. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">I worked on my life insurance guy. But I\u2019m not overly anxious about it. It\u2019s not wearing on me. It\u2019s on my mind, but it\u2019s not doing what it used to do to me. But I\u2019m seeing Donna this afternoon. I\u2019ve got to do something to try to remember the afternoon Adderall. [23:30] That\u2019s part of the whole being <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">confused and forgetting shit is that, why can\u2019t I remember? Every fucking day? I even have an alarm now. Maybe there\u2019s a better alarm out there. Maybe I should do it as a reminder so it shows up on my Outlook as well. You know what I mean? Like, right now I\u2019m just using an alarm clock. Maybe that will <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D3\">help. But I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Could you get Marcia to text it to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: She\u2019s more confused and forgetful than I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: Maybe she can do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. She was supposed to \u2013 I did tell her that Donna has repeatedly gotten mad at her for not reminding me to take my medicine. [24:14] And usually that night she\u2019ll remind me to take my medicine. I think it\u2019s because she takes care of Mrs. H. that you would think oh, she has these great caretaker <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">skills. But it\u2019s like me. I don\u2019t want a lawyer for myself. I don\u2019t have the energy. It\u2019s the same thing with her, you know. It\u2019s like, doing an overnight with a 96-year-old woman who\u2019s blind and crazy. They have a 24-hour shift. She only does from like, 5:30 to 10:00 in the morning. But they like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200552\">over Saturday have a 24-hour shift. The woman or whoever ends up taking that job quits, \u2018cause you know, it\u2019s a rough job. So I think that might play into it a little bit. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve got to take responsibility. [25:25] I\u2019ll try to figure out a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">I\u2019ll try the reminder thing. And this is one of my problems is I talk about it right now and then I forget about it. There\u2019s been a lot of that stuff going on. So the latest on the short sale. I don\u2019t remember where we were as of last Tuesday, but the lawyer, you know, sends an e-mail to Phil, my lawyer, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">and says his guy\u2019s going to submit an offer that he thinks the lender will accept. But he\u2019s retaining all rights under the original offer. My reply to Phil was, he can go fuck himself. The offer comes in. Who submits the offer as his broker? Claire. Now, the only problem I have with that, is I\u2019m worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200572\">for Claire, because that\u2019s a conflict of interest. She has to disclose to Jess and I a new representation, because she represented us at one point, you know. [26:40] I\u2019m a little surprised, \u2018cause she\u2019s usually very, you know. And I think this thing legally is so overwhelming her. I\u2019m surprised. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200573\">she wants to get away from it. She\u2019s worked with Jerry. I have no problem with her being the one that submits it. I wish I could tell her she\u2019s wasting her time. Maybe she figured it out when \u2013 Or, maybe she wasn\u2019t on that e-mail. But Patricia forwarded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">The first bid that his lawyer called Patricia and asked \u2013 and this was Wednesday, \u2018cause I was in housing court, what our offers were that we received. She\u2019s like, I can\u2019t tell you that. Cameron gives permission. Of course, I\u2019m not going to give my permission. [27:28] And then finally like, on Friday <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">or Saturday, the offer comes in. And pretty much the same agreement, other than the price was right. But it still had the stupid fucking paragraph that I agreed to last time that I\u2019m not going to agree to this time. And I took two seconds just to see what the price was and looked through it and replied <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200592\">to Patricia, you can tell Jerry to go fuck himself and you can quote me on that. And Jess was on the e-mail. And she\u2019s kind of taking the \u2013 she\u2019s like, let\u2019s work with Jerry. I said, listen, Jess, the decline we got. Yes, it says on there, not enough information and you might feel you\u2019ve got exposure <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200593\">there. But the line above that, have we given all the information, does not eliminate the litigation. [28:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">She just wants \u2013 and I want to get it over, too. But I don\u2019t want to be treated this way. I don\u2019t want to be litigated into something. I mean, I do it to people, but I try and mediate the situation first. You know, that condo thing that I\u2019m, you know. I called her up. I e-mailed her. I sent her letters. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B1\">She called me. It wasn\u2019t boom, I\u2019m going to fucking sue your ass. And Phi did send a response to that guy, basically threatening him with pretty much tortious interference and all this stuff, you know. So Jess, once again is like \u2013 I don\u2019t know who is annoying me more, Jerry or Jess. Jess\u2019 all worried. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B2\">I go, listen, Jess. He\u2019s got no legs to stand on. She\u2019s like, why don\u2019t we just accept his offer. I said, listen, we\u2019re doing what he wanted us to do. [29:31] we\u2019re putting his old offer \u2013 we\u2019re putting that through. And when it gets rejected, he\u2019s done. He can\u2019t sue us. Jess, he can\u2019t sue us. It would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B3\">be a Rule 11 violation for that attorney to sign a pleading in good faith that we somehow had done something wrong. And if anything, his guy fucked up by hiring him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">Had he gone to a real estate attorney and set up a real estate litigator, the real estate attorney would have done what I had suggested and mediated this thing and would have told Jerry, your fucking offer sucks, why don\u2019t you put in a good one. But this real estate litigator. Oh, I know real estate. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D1\">He didn\u2019t have half the facts. What kind of litigator are you that you didn\u2019t even know. I be like, you know, I would, well, what communications have you had. He didn\u2019t know all the e-mails that went \u2013 [30:35] So I told Jess, I said, yon u know, and I\u2019m raising my voice and she\u2019s like, don\u2019t yell at <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D2\">me. I go, I\u2019m not yelling at you. I\u2019m just this fired up about it. She said, well, don\u2019t you know how to ? I said, no. And then, I\u2019m not angry about it. I\u2019m just strong in my position that he\u2019s not buying this fucking condo. It\u2019s his own fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">THERAPIST: How long will it take to get the rejection back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. We just finally got everything to the sheriff\u2019s sale specialist. So I don\u2019t know. And I wish he would just say, send us a letter saying, \u2018cause she gets paid out of the sale, that she\u2019s not willing to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">THERAPIST: The short sale specialist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. That she\u2019s not willing to submit this offer and waste her time, because she knows it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 But she won\u2019t do that. [31:33] Which is probably for the better. Let\u2019s just get the denial from Chase and let me personally call them up. So that\u2019s been going on and driving me nuts, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200651\">just from the perspective of Jess. She gets it form her dad. She just worries about everything. Kids, or you know. But I had a good weekend with my dad. He actually looked better than the last time. Flo and everyone \u2013 I asked people how they think he looked, and people really do think that he looks <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200652\">85. The guy has been through hell, you know. And I\u2019m worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">I don\u2019t know how much longer he can last going like this. [32:25] But, you know, I felt a little bad on Saturday and went and took a nap. He\u2019s got a scooter and the cane. They were excited to see the kids. Lucille\u2019s a little funny where she won\u2019t give you a hug or a kiss and then she does. It was so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">sweet. I was taking them to the airport with Ian, and we were inside the Manchester Burger. And I was like, you know, why don\u2019t you say goodbye to Flo and Bibi and why don\u2019t you give Bibi a kiss. She doesn\u2019t like the whiskers. So I\u2019m in the car and we\u2019re in Davis Square getting parked so my dad can <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200672\">easily get out. And I said, Lucille, Bibi\u2019s going home. Why don\u2019t you give him a kiss. And she goes and kisses him. [33:14] So you know, I think it went well. And Marcia did have dinner with us Saturday. You know, I said, listen. Trying to let her dump me is ridiculous. I know she loves me. I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200673\">going to let another opportunity of her seeing the kids go, because she\u2019s not seeing them consistently enough. It\u2019s not her fault. She was supposed to see the Harlem Globetrotters. There\u2019s been things that have happened. But I was glad \u2013 Then she got pissed off at me. And this is the perfect example.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20069\">You know, the kids are going swimming. Lucille\u2019s jumping in the pool, just like Ian. The whole lesson at the Y, he just wants to jump in the pool. And that\u2019s all she wanted to do. That, and ride on my back across the pool. And Ian is getting to be a good swimmer and doesn\u2019t need me there to hold him <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200691\">or whatever. He didn\u2019t cry like \u2013 So, that went really well. The kids had a blast. And I\u2019m taking Ian to go get the car. We parked at the gallery. [34:24] I looked at my watch \u2013 or, my phone \u2013 and saw it was 6:00. We\u2019re supposed to be at the restaurant in (inaudible at 34:32) at 6:00 and it didn\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200692\">register. And then she calls me. I\u2019m like oh, sorry. It\u2019s just \u2013 I mean, literally. It\u2019s just been crazy trying to wake up my dad and wake up \u2013 you know, get them motivated. And she was just pissed that I didn\u2019t call her. Which you know, she was a little bit pissed. We got there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B\">And I hadn\u2019t seen her since the fight. She\u2019s no hug, no kiss. I\u2019m like, looking at her in the booth, and she\u2019ll look behind the booth and go right past me. And then after a while, I think she just \u2013 by the end of the meal, everything was fine. [35:19] Once again, I don\u2019t know that I can really blame <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B1\">her for being aggravated. She had to wait there a half an hour. When I went over Sunday, you know. It was an exhausting weekend. I\u2019m still very tired. I wake up at 5:00 yesterday, and instead of going \u2013 you know, I was going to go to North Andover, so I was going to go home, take a shower, do some work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B2\">Went and slept \u2018til 8:00. Same thing this morning. I get up at 5:00. I get home at 6:00, you know, do some work. I slept until like, 8:45. Just exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D\">You know, it\u2019s just soccer. It\u2019s just every day there\u2019s something. And they\u2019ve asked me to be registrar of the soccer league. [36:15] Which, you know, I don\u2019t really know that there\u2019s a job other than equipment coordinator which has like, one week of hell. There\u2019s not a job that\u2019s not time consuming. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D1\">It\u2019s not like the farm board where I can just be on the board without really having a role. I can be no a committee and I give legal advice. But Plymouth\u2019s not set up that way. So I think registrar is a perfect position to get myself some face time to meet a lot of the folks. I feel a little like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D2\">not part of the kids\u2019 lives. There\u2019s been time when I\u2019ve actually missed them, you know. [37:06] And then there\u2019s other times like yesterday where \u2013 But just in case, I also got an insurance policy on Lucille. Thought I think if you kill somebody, you can\u2019t collect on the insurance if you\u2019re the \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F\">Anyway, so like, yesterday, I was going to do this motion, I told Jess can you take the kids for me and she did. You know, I\u2019ve got the cash and the title. I mean, I did some reading and some \u2013 went through the rules and, you know, I told the client I\u2019m very confident about our standing. I\u2019m cautiously <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F1\">optimistic about winning the motion. I think that\u2019s, once again, turn around and go back to the doing the acupuncture. \u2018Cause really, a year ago I was fuck the acupuncture, \u2018cause I can\u2019t afford the $97.00 a week and do the chiropractic that at least my insurance is going to give me some money back <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F2\">on. And she gave me the option. I said, but the reality is, is that being out of alignment and that kind of stuff \u2013 I need the acupuncture. [38:25] I don\u2019t know what your thoughts are on acupuncture.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20071\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know a lot about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20073\">CLIENT: There was a time when I was trading with a woman in the square in a service exchange. And I left the house, and I was fucking just going a mile a minute, ruminating. Just freaking out. I walk over there and I could not leave the place, I was so relaxed. I wouldn\u2019t have \u2013 I couldn\u2019t drive a car, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200731\">I was so raucous. I mean, sometimes you get up and you\u2019re a little dizzy and disoriented. But I was \u2013 I mean, it calmed me down. It was also effective in \u2013 I was getting my shoulder worked on. It will get rid of the pain for a day or two. It came back, but, you know. So I think, you know, the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200732\">chiropractor, Dr. Grace, she wanted to work on my stomach. It can\u2019t hurt. I still feel I\u2019m getting stomach pains, and I just don\u2019t want to go on the Prednisone. [39:27] I think sugar\u2019s got a large part. I cut that out for a long time. It\u2019s creeped back over the years, pretty much since I went crazier. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200733\">But I was sad on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20075\">THERAPIST: You mean from the stuff with Marcia?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20077\">CLIENT: You know, and same \u2013 she dumped me, because she said she never wanted to talk to me again, wished me luck.

I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B1\">every once in a while he gets really wasted and just goes to the front and spins. You know, it\u2019s like a fucking Dead Head thing or whatever. [41:23] And I noticed that Casey \u2013 first of all, Casey was kind of being al title too touchy feely with me, you know, grinding and stuff like that. But I finally <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B2\">just reached around and grabbed his sack and he never touched me. But he did send a text the next day to Marcia saying that I did that and that he thinks he liked it. But him and his wife are trying to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Do you know him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. We know him. But I think he\u2019s trying to either get Marcia to do a threesome with his wife or \u2013 \u2018Cause we went over there weeks ago, and when we got there the wife seemed a little upset. And then she went upstairs, and Marcia\u2019s like, you didn\u2019t notice how she came downstairs and her <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F1\">shirt was all buttoned and how she gave you a hug when she left? [42:11] And I did notice how she gave me a hug when we left. But he was being all this stuff. I was probably just doing the same thing, and she was pissed off with him, too. But because it\u2019s me \u2013 So, she said I was mean, and she \u2013 I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F2\">wasn\u2019t happy with the answer, and so I went up to the front and hung out in front. I was just like, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562390\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20091\">So actually, I went to the pizza place to get a slice of pizza. And I came back and she \u2013 I saw her. And of course, the first thing I said is, you know, why were you mean to me? And she was like, fuck that. So that\u2019s kind of what happened. And we took a cab home and she left. And she shouldn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200911\">been driving, and I tried to grab her keys. [42:58] And even when I said that, she goes, you didn\u2019t try very hard. So what am I supposed to do, grab her and tackle her? I mean, she\u2019s a feisty little broad. I could not get the keys out of her hand. I mean, she\u2019s got these tiny little hands. So I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200912\">sad, but I still felt, you know. I knew she wasn\u2019t really \u2013 I said, this is a temporary thing. And I knew it was a temporary thing. And it actually lasted a lot shorter, because I really wanted her to come to the thing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20093\">THERAPIST: On Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20095\">CLIENT: \u2026on Saturday. Once again, I admitted I was wrong. [43:52] So yeah, I\u2019m just all over the place, but it\u2019s in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, the way you\u2019re talking today is a little more sort of all over the place and scattered, I think, than usually. Although a lot of the things you\u2019re talking about are good. I mean, the thing with Marcia wasn\u2019t good, but it sounds like you feel pretty good about how you handled <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200971\">it. You were confident how it was going to turn out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20099\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m learning. I\u2019m \u2013 the next time. Oh, by the way, Friday was our one year anniversary of meeting. This was the shirt she got me, \u2018cause that\u2019s the concert we met at. So she sent me something in the morning. She\u2019s like, well, I guess you really don\u2019t care. Happy anniversary. And that\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200991\">point I should have been like, starting to apologize. But I didn\u2019t. But I think I\u2019m learning from these things. Like I said, she\u2019s obsessed with me. She said, I love you more than you know or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009B\">THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yes, we do. I\u2019ll let you know when you move up on the list. Yeah. You might want to reissue the invoices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A1\">CLIENT: Have a happy Passover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Thanks. You too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A5\">CLIENT: How long will you be out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll be out two weeks from today. I\u2019m in next week. The following week I\u2019m out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A9\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 45:58) Joan\u2019s which is a Sunday.
