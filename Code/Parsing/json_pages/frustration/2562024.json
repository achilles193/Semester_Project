I\u2019m feeling the stomach pains. Well, originally I was wondering why my wrist wasn\u2019t healing. I\u2019ve got arthritis in some of my knuckles from the Crohn\u2019s. Crohn\u2019s is an inflammation and very often, in the past after a flare, I\u2019ve gotten arthritis.

You know? Because I didn\u2019t do anything. I hadn\u2019t been doing anything. I\u2019ve been eating <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">like shit so I\u2019ve started at least to be conscious of that and not [suck down] (ph). I got a roll, a cranberry pecan roll, instead of a [inaudible at 00:02:15] to avoid all that sugar.

So like the weather. I don\u2019t even have time to think about the weather. Not time like in time, but there are just other things out there, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Well, I think the idea with (inaudible at 00:3:16) with the eating is like you just try to (inaudible at 00:03:20) while you\u2019re eating.

If you don\u2019t want to do it, you don\u2019t have to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019ll be waiting (inaudible at 00:03:34) I\u2019m going to get drunk and fucking start sucking down chicken wings. I\u2019m trying to avoid the sugar first because that\u2019s an inflammatory and I\u2019ve one off sugar before and I\u2019ve been drinking a lot of soda recently and things I don\u2019t do sugar wise. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">I think that\u2019s causing some problems. I know the Prednisone destroyed my immune system because I\u2019ve had cold after cold after cold since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">You know, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to do me any good to make an appointment with my GI (ph) but I think I\u2019m going to do that. That\u2019s going to be five years from now and then just go see my Primary Care who can give me blood tests. I\u2019d like some Ultram (sp?) or something for my stomach. It\u2019s like right <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">now, every time I eat something it hurts.

I\u2019ve had to work through just really feeling like crap yesterday and I had to see a client. Luckily I didn\u2019t go into some huge coughing fit. Finally went and got some Mucinex and that\u2019s cleared up my nose and helps. And the Tylenol helps my ankle <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">a little bit, but it\u2019s fucking [inaudible 00:05:01] down. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to stop the bleeding. You know what I mean? It\u2019s just like one thing after another, but I\u2019m all happy. Yay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">But no, I actually financially, I think I\u2019m a little more positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh, good. That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: You know I started with a financial planner at Edward Jones, just pulling out $100 every month. I don\u2019t have a log in. I\u2019m not going online. I\u2019m not signing up for that. And basically I\u2019m trying to build an emergency fund for the next time I fucking lose my shit. To cover my expenses. And as <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">I get money here and there, I can put a little extra money in there as well. Something I\u2019m very excited about is a designer just joined the BMI (sp?) group and we meet at the galley in Essex which is this dated, nautical themed fish-fry place on the water. The bar (inaudible at 00:06:29).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Doug walks into the room and he just looks around. To me a designer\u2019s someone who comes into an empty space and puts it or rearranges stuff, but he really seems to have a more involved than just hanging pictures or putting furniture. And my office is much like yours. I\u2019ve got this thing that sticks <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">out. It\u2019s small. Mine is split in half, so mine\u2019s even more awkward. So you got my office and the reception\/conference room. So he came up with some ideas which I think, number one, I think just walking into a more professional office is going to help me. I think it\u2019s going to be, because people walk <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">by, they\u2019re going to see a more professional office. When people come in, it doesn\u2019t look like I just moved in. [I got] (ph) a couple pictures on the wall, but that\u2019s it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">And it\u2019s going to cost me some money that I don\u2019t have. So I did something that, hopefully I\u2019m not going to regret. But I got a credit card. And right now, it is only for business expenses and like emergencies. Like a really good concert and I don\u2019t have the money for it. But not for every day. In fact, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I\u2019m trying to build up even a little cushion there for the every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">And business seems to be doing a little better. I\u2019ve hired a woman who is \u2013it\u2019s funny because I get a lot of stuff, mostly about my website or different things. Advertising. Some exclusive advertisements. You know, I get this e-mail that said, \u201cGrowth in numbers.\u201d Something, \u201cMore closings in Pembroke\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">When the sales person does something a little unique, I give them the benefit of the doubt. Like the woman I bought the clothes from, she crumpled up the letter and says, \u201cTo save you some time, I\u2019ve pre-crumpled this letter for you.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s ingenious.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she came up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">with it or not. So I called her and she made a sale out of it. What this woman did is she gave me the turnover rates for Pembroke and explained basically how I can be a part of getting those closings. When I think of that I\u2019m thinking, \u201cBank. Buyer.\u201d So she comes in and basically what she does is she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">a realtor. [She used to do this realtors now is focusing on attorneys.] (Ph) And goes in, she creates a little flyer type advertisement. An 8 \u00bd X 11. It\u2019ll have a nice thing on one side and on the other side will be white, except for there\u2019ll (ph) be language as it\u2019s folded up and you pull it out of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">the envelope it says, \u201cHold this. Put this in a safe place or put this away until you get your first offer.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562024\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">And basically, she\u2019s going to sending this out. First up, everybody who\u2019s listed a property in Pembroke in Plymouth. I\u2019ve got those two towns exclusive. And then as new listings come on, which is where the real value, I think is, she\u2019s going to be sending these out weekly. And it\u2019s a few hundred bucks <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">a month so one deal, one [seller up] (ph). So the idea is to get these [seller ups] (ph) which the easiest money I make is [seller ups] (ph). I mean, not to say that they\u2019re not bad [and all] (ph). I mean, I just went through a crazy one at the end of the year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">And you know, all this stuff kind of adds up. Number one, people are going to be learning my name in these towns if they\u2019re staying in the town or they\u2019re moving to another town. So it\u2019s just some good PR. I never would have thought of myself as doing this kind of\u2026 If I did a mass mailing, it would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">be a letter or something more professional. And it\u2019s going to say on the envelope, I have to put advertising on there. It\u2019s advertising. So they know it\u2019s an advertisement. But it\u2019s coming in an envelope from a law office. So we\u2019ll see. Probably take three month to see if... so I\u2019m going to give it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">six months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Good luck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Thank you. I\u2019ve been budgeting or thinking about budgeting in both the business and personally to see where my spending\u2019s going and places I could\u2026 For instance, Marcia gave me a TV for Christmas and now she wants me to get cable. She really doesn\u2019t want to come over because I don\u2019t have a TV <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">and cable. And I asked my landlord a while ago about, \u201cWhat would it cost me to get a box in my room and basic cable?\u201d And he was like, \u201c$66\u201d or something like that. I still [owe him] (ph) like $5,000 or whatever. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s not a lot.\u201d Here\u2019s someone whose got no work and can\u2019t pay <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">her rent and all this. And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, $67. What\u2019s that?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Do you have Wi-Fi?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I do. And yeah, the streaming stuff. But really for me, it\u2019s sports. And for her, it\u2019s Housewives of New Jersey, Beverly Hills, New York, Atlanta. You know all the [places] (ph) they have that. But the reality is, $66 is not a lot of money. I throw that away in scratch tickets I buy for her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">So if I\u2019m smarter about making sure my expenses are covered. I think sometimes when there\u2019s money there I\u2019m just going spend it. I\u2019m going to buy concert tickets. I\u2019m going to buy weed. Going to buy booze. Going to take her out for a nice dinner. I\u2019m going to spend the money. So I\u2019m trying to find ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">to get the money out of my account, when it goes in there and building up cushions outside of my normal accounts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Gotcha (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: So I\u2019ve got my financial planner building one cushion. I\u2019ve got the credit card now, which I\u2019m very conscious of utilization now, which is how much you use of your credit line. Right now, I have a Gap card. I\u2019ve got a $200 limit and I owe like $140. So that\u2019s a bad utilization. They want it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">around 30%. So that\u2019s my goal after I get my office. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562024\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">I\u2019m going to get a nice table. Like this wood, kind of tree thing. Going to get some cabinets. Like the wall that has this. If that was my reception area, there would be just like a counter that\u2019s going to come across, stop, start again, and there\u2019s my office. It goes into my office and I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">have some cabinets above that. I\u2019ve already ordered the Kurt (ph) machine. That\u2019s going to sit next to the [Brita things] (ph) so I can offer people\u2014oh, it\u2019s horrible. Because I\u2019ve got to go grab water for my mouth. You know, my dry mouth. And I don\u2019t offer people water or coffee. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">So I got a huge deal on a Kurt (ph) machine, which we\u2019ll see if it shows up in one condition. It\u2019s one of these e-commerce websites where they basically set it all up for you and you just sell your product. And what I think happens is one of two things. I was looking at the basic $150 model, which seemed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">like I could get for probably $120, $130, whatever. This guy had it for like $80. So when I pulled that up, there was a nicer one for $90 but it was the new, it\u2019s the View, it\u2019s a different cup (ph). So I looked at the next higher up one, which is the Chrome. The one you would want to put in your office <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">if people were going to see it. And that\u2019s a $180 coffee maker for $99.99, free shipping. And I they use PayPal, so if there\u2019s any problem I\u2019m covered. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">So I figure this guy either stole them or he ordered too many and he can\u2019t get rid of them and so now he\u2019s just trying to dump them after Christmas. And hopefully I can do that for a lot of the\u2014I mean, I\u2019ve already got one in my fridge of those big sort of Brita things where it\u2019s got the little\u2026 So <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">I can just put that on the counter and keep water in there and (inaudible at 00:16:39) people if they want ice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">Maybe resurface my desk. First, Marcia and I were going to paint, but then a friend of hers the other night, her dad just died. Laurel. She\u2019s got no work. She\u2019s broke. She spent all her money on making these Trevon Martin sweatshirts that she sold none of. It says something on it. It doesn\u2019t say Trevon <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">Martin, but it says something like, \u201cI\u2019m not a criminal. A hoody doesn\u2019t make me a criminal\u201d or something like that. And she\u2019s not doing anything with that, so she has no money. And she\u2019s really a large woman. And she\u2019s always like, \u201cOh, do you have any bachelor friends you can set me up with?\u201d I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200572\">just like, \u201cUh\u2026\u201d All my friends play ultimate, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">She\u2019s really nice. But she\u2019s broke so I was like, \u201cDo you want to paint my office?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you going to charge me?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201c$150.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOh (ph).\u201d Instead of just giving her $150\u2014 Marcia was like, \u201cI thought I was going to help paint?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">you know (inaudible at 00:17:52) but Laurel.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">So I got a new paint job. I already feel better when my blinds went in. So spending some money for some psychic (ph) capital maybe? But I will pay that down and try to keep that one-third. I\u2019ve got a credit monitoring website that sends me information all the time. You know, if someone does an inquiry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">an account\u2019s opened, [I give you] (ph) my credit score, my utilization. All kinds of different information. What credit cards I can qualify for. And so I could track that stuff pretty easily now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562024\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">I was thinking about selling Braymore (ph), and you know what, (inaudible at 00:18:52) $1,500 free and clear and it\u2019s just stupid for me to give that up. And there\u2019s a guy who wants to buy it and obviously if I sell it at a short sale, my credits going to take less than it (inaudible at 00:19:06) foreclosure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">But right now, I don\u2019t owe any money on the note because that\u2019s gone because of the bankruptcy. Congraphies the bank\u2019s paying. Taxes the bank\u2019s paying. I\u2019m not paying anything. I\u2019m not paying anything for the condo and I\u2019m getting $1500. And they just separated and she\u2019s a doctor and I think (inaudible at 00:19:28).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">Well, I feel like I\u2019ve restarted my whole business. You know, like three years ago. He (ph) started from scratch. I didn\u2019t but, he started a firm from scratch like a year or two ago. He was always laid (ph) and you know, whatever. Then I got my new iPhone that\u2019s waiting for me. Hopefully in the foyer <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">and not still on the porch. Well, I got my upgrade. And of course I can\u2019t go with the 16 GB because I put at least 20 in music on there. So between photos and apps I put 32. So that was like $299. Well, to trade in my phone they were going to give me $119. So now it\u2019s like a little over $200 with the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">upcharge (ph) or whatever. Once again that\u2019s something that will make me feel a little better. I think (inaudible at 00:20:43) or do you have the 4S?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: 5<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: The 5?

Galaxies are bigger. I\u2019m not watching fucking General Hospital on my phone. So yeah, just happened to have extra time because of the (inaudible at 00:21:27) storm. I stayed down in Norwood (sp?) and going through <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">that really. And started working on getting my mileage logged and just getting my house in order. I was up in the office yesterday doing the same thing, clearing out the old bank accounts, getting the new bank accounts in order. Sort of putting together the list of people I didn\u2019t send Christmas cards <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">to that I need to reach out to. You know, just that kind of stuff. So it\u2019s just [a difficult, so I felt like crap] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">And it\u2019s usual bull shit of 3:00 yesterday, [title order] (ph). \u201cHey. Great. I finally got a title examination. [You know, I\u2019ve] (ph) been slow. Oh, it\u2019s a rush. Oh, tomorrow! Tomorrow morning.\u201d I said I can have it by the end of the day tomorrow. I worked on it some last night. Marcia\u2019s very intolerant. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">She can\u2019t wait. She\u2019s very impatient. So I try to do as much as I can.

I\u2019m (inaudible at 00:22:55) for that first time it happens and hopefully we\u2019re not naked. But I feel like I\u2019m talking to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">them and they either cut me off or they\u2019re just not listening. You know, we\u2019re over at Marcia\u2019s sister\u2019s house and she\u2019s got ADHD.

So I\u2019m about to tell her how I\u2019m starting to feel pretty crappy, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">she turns around and just starts talking to someone else.

Just vrum (sp?). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">And I guess there are just certain things I have to get used to in women, and tolerate? Because I\u2019ve noticed difference between Jess and Marcia which are noticeable differences, but there are certain things that I just guess all fucking women do, which is not pay attention to me when I speak. Or at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">least women I\u2019m attracted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Or at least two of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. Two [inaudible at 00:24:29]. So yeah, I\u2019ve been really fucking upset because I\u2019m sick and my ankles and I barely get around.

Last year was not a great year. But I started making money in areas that I had not been making before. So the landlord tent (ph), the condo, I just got another condo guy (ph) collection yesterday. And each of those is like a closing (ph) so\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">I got this woman who lives in a disaster down in Easton and her landlord\u2019s an asshole and he\u2019s going to be paying attorney\u2019s fees and so he\u2019ll be here for a while but I\u2019ll make some good money on that. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m getting money from Grandma E dying. My mom once mentioned to me that I was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">to get some money. I don\u2019t want to bring it up. I want [it home] (ph), but I don\u2019t want to bring it up. I don\u2019t want to give the impression that that\u2019s something\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to think about the money I\u2019m getting from my parents. Just inheritance is something that happens and I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">to plan for it is what I\u2019m saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">But my mom\u2014I just wanted to know if everything was in a trust, which I had hoped my uncle had done, which he did do, or they were going to go through probate (ph) and Oregon. (Chuckles) But everything was in trust and my mom said, \u201cHey, he\u2019s sending me a check by the end of the week or something like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200891\">that.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get a check or if she\u2019s supposed to cut me a check or if she wants to cut me a check. So I might just send her a text. I don\u2019t know. But basically, that money\u2019s going to my landlord and to Flo, who are the two people who are my bank. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s Flo?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: Flo.

Originally I was like, \u201cOh, I just give the whole thing to her\u201d but no, I\u2019ve got to catch up on my rent. I bounced $2,000 which she hasn\u2019t fucking cashed those checks yet.

So now he\u2019s got $3,000 of checks, which I\u2019ve got to sit there and look at my account and not spend it. At least in my old bank account when I did [bill pay] (ph) it took it out. But then it took it put it back when he didn\u2019t cash it so I got all fucked up. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">[Now it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s what happens.] (ph) But still, I got October, November, December, and January. Four months behind.

I don\u2019t know. Do they notify you of that? Like let\u2019s say you\u2019re collecting a co-pay and they all of a sudden tell you that you don\u2019t need co-pays anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah, [I\u2019ve been to] (ph) an electronic EOB that\u2019s [fed into my billing software] (ph) automatically so I can see it there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay.

And just various things here and there. Mostly for priority. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s Flo going to do to me, what\u2019s the landlord going to do to me. What\u2019s the hospital going to do to me? You know? They\u2019re not like credit card companies. You know? You might get a collection or whatever and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">know what you do, but I\u2019ll take you down\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:29:48) I was just thinking about the hospital, there are some guys that\u2019ll put you in the hospital but that doesn\u2019t get them anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I tried telling someone there was a Jewish mafia and they didn\u2019t believe me. I said, \u201cWhat do you think those (inaudible at 00:30:08) Jews are dealing all the diamonds. You think those guys are all above board? Nah (sp?) They\u2019re killing people left and right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:19)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: (Sneezes)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: Thank you. But yeah, so I got the new client over Christmas. I got the new client yesterday. I\u2019m going to meet a guy I know from tailgating and ultimate, who he and a buddy want to buy some property. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen (inaudible at 00:30:54). I mean, we may get our charter <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">pulled or whatever, pretty soon. But Eddie and I are on the same page\u2014he\u2019s vice president\u2014that we\u2019ll just go to some other organization. We\u2019re going to keep the group together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">Because one of the problems is BNI\u2019s (ph) expensive. And BNI\u2019s (ph) starting to get this reputation\u2014it\u2019s always had some reputation, but now it\u2019s really like they\u2019re cannibalizing the chapters. They\u2019re just building too many. All they care about is the chapter size. And the charge is a good chunk of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">money where these other groups aren\u2019t like that. So I just have to be careful that I\u2019m not in something that\u2019s going to put me in a quo pro situation. Ethically, I give a referral to someone they\u2019re going to refer back to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">So I\u2019ll just issue something in writing to myself as president of the chapter, that ethical standards\u2014you know, it\u2019s already in the BMI (ph) code\u2014whatever the word is, superseded. So even though I should be worried about that I\u2019m not. I\u2019m still trying to get people motivated, but I don\u2019t know. There <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">are some people who are going to be renewing and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to leave the group or not. Reality is, I want people to not leave just for the numbers of it, but if someone really wants to leave (inaudible at 00:04:59) stay in the group, you know? We\u2019ve talked people into staying over <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B12\">the years and it\u2019s never been a \u201cOh, boy. They\u2019ve really become a great member\u201d type of thing. And right now, you know, Patricia really is pissed at being on (ph). She was president last time. She\u2019s an angry woman. I\u2019m started to get just sick of it too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562024\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">I\u2019m going to write a letter to Boch Honda [so they\u2019ll] (ph) fix my car. I also want to write a letter to the founder of BNI (ph) explaining the situation and help her feel what they\u2019re doing to us is contrary to the very philosophy of BNI (ph) which is \u2018givers gain\u2019 and this is \u2018takers gain.\u2019 Basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B31\">the administrative cost of running a chapter don\u2019t make them enough money. They\u2019re making (inaudible at 00:33:42) but they\u2019re making [nothing else] (ph).I mean they charge us for training so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re putting money up for that. I\u2019ve been meaning to meet with our, not our, area director. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B32\">He\u2019s on my list of people to contact. But yeah, my car. What\u2019s bothering me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s a starter? [They tried] (ph) the wrong key\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes. I got a different key to start it. I\u2019ve got one door lock and I have to use the old key to do that, and I don\u2019t have my remote. And basically, I don\u2019t know if I should e-mail the sales guy or sales manager, but my beef is this. You know, I took a week old car into your shop thinking I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B71\">going to be driving out a week old car. And I didn\u2019t. I drove out with a car that was not a week old. I couldn\u2019t open the doors with my lock. You know, I can\u2019t lock it. Just with the kids. You know, being in Andover carrying things. To always have to go around the snow. Always having to go around to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B72\">the front door to unlock the lock. You know, it\u2019s much more of a pain in the ass than one would think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">And it\u2019s even more of a pain in the ass knowing how new my car is and how much I\u2019m paying a month. If they had said it would have\u2014they never gave me the option. And so at this point, \u201cYou\u2019re going to come pick up my car. You\u2019re going to drop off a courtesy car.\u201d I imagine I would pay a reasonable fee <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B91\">for whatever it would to take my car back to normal, because I should have paid that in the first place. But I expect a discount from them. Flo and my dad think I should just contact Honda, but I believe in chain of command. How could you go to the Honda without even complaining to the service department? <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B92\">Give them the opportunity to fix it. They could even pick the car up in Watertown. I\u2019m not going to make them go to Andover. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re in Watertown?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So the one mistake my landlords always do, the one mistake my tenants always do is there\u2019s that e-mail at the initial part of, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD1\">out.\u201d They always say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been a great tenant.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been a great landlord.\u201d Well now, what is it? Is this the landlord that never fixed anything or is this the \u201cGreat landlord?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562024\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">So I can say, \u201cHey, I got great customer service.\u201d But I point out the things they did right. And do those first. And this was the calm one. The next one is the screaming phone call, which I don\u2019t do that anymore. I\u2019m going to have to go off my lamento (ph) for a few days before I make that phone call. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">Marcia and a friend of hers, we were\u2014what night was this? This was the blizzard. Thursday. She lives a few blocks away. Her boyfriend didn\u2019t show up and she was just alone so she came over to hang out and we were playing cards and whatnot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">You know, for nighttime I take a Klonopin (sp?) and Lamictal (sp?). 50 mgs have gone down, which I either have a tab of 100 or two 25s. So I put on the counter a Klonopin and two 25s and took my Questran (sp?) which is a powder. Drank that. And normally I drink the pills with the Questran, which I probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C31\">shouldn\u2019t do. But apparently, I didn\u2019t take the Klonopin and the Lamictal and Marcia says to me, \u201cDid you leave those pills on the counter for us?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cHow wasted were you guys?\u201d Because I went to bed. And she was like, \u201cOh, we thought you left those for us. What were they?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C32\">did you do? Each take a half of the Klonopin and one of the Lamictals?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I guess your bipolar is going to be cured for a day. I don\u2019t know.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">(Pause) Here\u2019s the thing that\u2019s freaking me out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">THERAPIST: There something that\u2019s dangerous with Lamictal. What is it, going up or coming off it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">THERAPIST: One of those things is quite dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">CLIENT: Oh, taking it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Starting up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">CLIENT: The rash. Like the rash or something like that. I should tell them shouldn\u2019t I?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Might not be a bad idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll tell Marcia. The other one is fucking crazy. She\u2019s like trying to have sex with Marcia like you wouldn\u2019t believe. I was like, \u201cWhoa. This is just inappropriate.\u201d Of course I\u2019m encouraging it because I\u2019m a guy. Supposed to. Right? You know? I don\u2019t think Marcia n was enjoying it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">But here\u2019s this weird thing. I think about the car accident and I kind of go replay in my mind the hitting of a telephone or the hitting of another car, and it\u2019s not just I think about it. I actually get a physical manifestation of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You have a (inaudible at 00:40:12)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Are you asking if you have PFP (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: No. I just wanted to point that out. I assume this is something that\u2019s normal. Maybe not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Um\u2026 yeah. The question is, how much, how often, how long does it last? I mean I think to some extent, that\u2019s pretty normal and usual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: I mean it bothers me that I do it at all. I don\u2019t like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: How long has it been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: It was October 7th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Okay. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been two months. Three months. And it just happened the other day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Do you startle more easily in general?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Nightmares?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t remember dreams or nightmares or nothing. Rarely. The last one I did, a woman committed suicide.

Is it weird that I don\u2019t remember dreams? Anymore? I used to, but I don\u2019t. [Really I\u2019m just] (ph) going to wake up and go. I assumed it was the medication. I\u2019m not getting good round (ph) of sleep and I\u2019m going to die a slow painful death.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: (Pause) I don\u2019t know. Ask your prescriber of your medication about your memory thing, but I don\u2019t know. (Pause) Are you also taking any kinds (inaudible at 00:42:47)? Sometimes those will actually make your (inaudible 00:42:30) more vivid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: I\u2019m taking Prozac and Lovitran (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great. Yeah. So I don\u2019t know what the combination of that that\u2019ll make you (inaudible 00:42:41).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: Now that we\u2019re speaking about the anti-depressant and the Wellbutrin and the reason I\u2019m taking the Wellbutrin is to counteract the side effects of Prozac, which was why they thought it was weird I was having sexual dysfunction. I think you said and Doctor Province (sp?) said that it was performance <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">(ph) anxiety. And I think it was because I\u2019m not really having that issue anymore. But now I\u2019ve got this great prescription for Viagra. Of course when I take a Viagra we don\u2019t have sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: That was also happening when you and Marcia were just first getting together. (inaudible 00:43:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">CLIENT: That\u2019s why I think (inaudible at 00:43:31). Which is good because she was getting frustrated. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">But even like the type of pictures the designer wants me to put in the office has got me really excited. I\u2019m even going to go ahead and frame my law school diploma. I always thought it was border line pornography, because right under there it says, \u201cCum laude (sp?).\u201d No, I\u2019m a magnum cum laude. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201091\">right. (inaudible 00:44:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">I love telling (ph) Lucille to scream (ph).

Monday nights?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">CLIENT: Well, we\u2019re doing the Monday nights and she\u2019s sleeping over Saturday.

That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">CLIENT: I took them to a party and Marcia was there and Lucille hit it off with her. I was really nervous because Lucille like ran by her and Marcia kind of scratched her head. And I was like, \u201cOh my God. Is this too quick? Is this, you know?\u201d And they ended up playing tickle monster. And Ian was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201131\">\u201cCould you ask your friend Marcia to not tickle me because her nails scratch me.\u201d And I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWell, (inaudible at 00:45:16) it\u2019s the same problem I have.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">And I said, \u201cLucille, what\u2019s your favorite part of the party? What did you like the most?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cTickle monster.\u201d And then she remembered Marcia. And then later in the car ride she asked me to remind me of her name, just out of the blue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: Oh that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">CLIENT: That went well.

Ian had met her before at the golf thing, the miniature golf thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Saw and met her. So that went well. I\u2019m trying to work out a dinner. A Monday night dinner. I didn\u2019t have the kids last night (ph) because I was sick. They had them over the weekend. They have not played with Alice and Dorothy. Ian goes down there and I can\u2019t get him to say I\u2019m inviting <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D1\">them up. So they keep pushing back the time he can come down. I text them. Nothing. C\u2019est la vie. I\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s either me or (inaudible at 00:46:24) time or that they think that Dorothy misbehaves when she\u2019s around Ian which I think (inaudible at 00:46:30).
