(chuckle) (pause) (sigh) I kind of would talk about the awards, but like it would require a great deal of back-story to set-off why it\u2019s been so upsetting. And I don\u2019t know that I really want to recap since the last two years in politics <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">in the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah; this sun (inaudible at 0:01:01).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I understand. (pause) I\u2019d rather you not be distracted for the next hour squinting at the sun. (pause) So where to start. (sigh) I\u2019m going attempt to narrate this chronologically and linearly, but I can\u2019t promise that will work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So there\u2019s this other [], who is immensely popular, and has established a reputation for himself, and goodwill in the community by positioning himself as an ally to people of color and [what he is] (ph). Unsurprisingly, he\u2019s just [had white jute] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: He what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: [Just had white jute] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Had some sexual (intent) (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:01:55).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So, obviously I (inaudible at 0:02:03). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What is \u2013 all right, I don\u2019t want to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: It (sigh).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s okay, yeah I (inaudible at 0:02:14). (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: No, I mean, it\u2019s important that like you know what the words I use mean too. So you know transgender -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: You know, and actually, I know what you mean when you say cis as opposed to trans, I just \u2013 you know, trans stands for transgender, and I wondered what cis stood for. That\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Just gender.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Because in chemistry, cis is the opposite of trans, and so it was coined in order for cis to not be the unmarked default state, so you could actually mark it, as opposed to having innocent to people. Anyway, so it\u2019s just called the white (inaudible at 0:02:52).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">And he writes fiction by about four white dudes mostly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: I mean this section isn\u2019t bad, but like it\u2019s about dudes doing dudely things in dudely settings. And I\u2019m like, whatever. But he has positioned himself as an ally to women and people of color, especially women and people of color writers. And he does have a widely read blog, and he does invited <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">women and people of color to guest post on his blog; he gives exposure to people. But he also profits and benefits from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">He also likes to position himself as like the voice of reason in the field, and the voice of moderation, and like he is calm and dispassionate, and objective, and analytical, and like all these things that are terribly, terribly problematic cults that I don\u2019t have to explain why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">But anyway, over the last several years, he has nurtured a collection of trolls in the comics (city) (ph) blog, who he doesn\u2019t band, and he gives them space to like say their horrible things. And he takes a great joy and pleasure in arguing with them. He does actually argue the correct side if you ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">came in question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">But I don\u2019t know, he has limited space. And so there\u2019s this dude, who writes under the name [] is like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: [] (inaudible at 0:04:14)?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562372\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, he\u2019s not quite not arrogant, but I can see where you might have gotten than from. (chuckle) Anyway, he \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense that he mixes Latin and English that way, does it? Maybe he did intend it to be a [homophoned voice of God] (ph). I \u2013 whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: He is an overt racist and misogynist. And then he\u2019s actually made a blog post in which he says that, you know, rape should be allowed, because he\u2019s just pursuing his right to pursue happiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Oh God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. He has explicitly said that black people are not the same race as white people, and deserve to be put down like dogs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Oh my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019m not even paraphrasing; these are like quotes from his \u2013 he\u2019s terrible, and so he has let him \u2013 [overlapping conversation at 0:05:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: about having some problems. I mean and not just somebody with, you know, some kind of differing and unpleasant viewpoint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. He calls himself a Christian libertarian, which anyway \u2013 (sigh) So there\u2019s a big ta-do last summer when an up and coming black woman author; her books have been nominated for awards. As far as I know, they\u2019ve never won, but they always get short listed. She\u2019s very popular; she sells very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">well; she\u2019s a sweet person, like when you meet her. But she gave like this (boner) (ph) speech at some (con) somewhere, where she talked about how like as a community, we need to make it clear the racism fundimists aren\u2019t welcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">I mean among other things, she had like a whole 15-minute, covered on a number of topics, but one of the things she covered \u2013 anyway, [] would intensify this, and wrote a post about how George Zimmerman should put her down like he did Trayvon Martin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Oh gee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: And then he posted this to the \u2013 a professional association for science fiction writers; anyone who\u2019s a member of the association can promote their blog posts on the official rss feed and (inaudible at 0:06:39). So there\u2019s a process where you register an rss feed of your blog with the promotion <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">tool, and then if you tag your blog posts, it will automatically appear of the blog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">So he had disagreed about how she should be put down like a dog up here on the blog, which is against policy, so they kicked him out. It\u2019s the first time anyone has been kicked out of this association in like 35 years. And a lot of people were horrified by that, because free speech, oh my gosh, free <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">speech. (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">Anyway, another man, who is also a misogynist homophobic asshole, who like refuses to use correct pronouns for trans people and communicate that; like refuses to call by their name; just like, this female author. [0:07:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">He organized a voting blog on his blog to get him and like seven other people, who are similarly horrifying on the award ballot. Now this is not against the rules for the award; like anyone who ponies up their $40 can nominate whoever they want to be on the award ballot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: And this an award; I thought it was an award for science fiction writing? It is, okay. Has he written stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes. But they have written science fiction \u2013 I hesitate to call them books, because they are (sigh), they have spewed forth the words that are science fiction, that are bound in book form; I hesitate to call them novel, because they don\u2019t have anything resembling characterization of or plots.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562372\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: (chuckle) So they got themselves and their friends on the ballot, and again, not against the rules, but tacky as hell, especially if go read their book, they say they\u2019re doing this explicitly to offend women and people of color in the field, and the pinko common liberals, and blah, blah, blah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">blah, blah, blah, blah. [0:09:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">And they weren\u2019t promoting each other\u2019s books on the merits of the books; they were promoting them on the merits of like this will piss off women and people of color in the field. So a bunch of women and people of color in the field unsurprisingly, went on Twitter, or social media or wrote on their <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">blogs about how this was offensive, and insulting and like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Why are there so many terrible people in our field? (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">So all lead up to all of the things that are upsetting, because as horrible they and them are, their clearly in the minority; clearly apart from their tiny fan base, no one cares about them. It only requires like 100 votes to get on the ballot, because not that many people nominate, so whatever. There <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">are 100 (spitabonal) (ph), racist, misogynist assholes in the world; I knew that already. [0:10:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">So someone makes a post, poking fun of these guys and talking about how this is ridiculous. Then he gets a lot of people stirred up in the summit, then he makes another post about how ladies, let\u2019s not get hystNealal, what they did was not against the rules, blah, blah, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right, he could have done it a bit quicker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, then he went on about how last year, he organized his fans to nominate his book for the award, and that\u2019s totally legit, and blah, blah, blah. And it\u2019s just (sigh) (pause) it\u2019s insulting to the people who are annoyed about the ballot, to say \u2013 to imply that we don\u2019t understand how the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">rules work and all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">So last year when a female was on the ballot, a bunch of people, mostly white men, attacked her for having promoted her work on her blog. There were vicious, vicious, not just blog posts, but she had received rape threats and death threats in her physical mailbox at her house. So people got her address; <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">knew where she lived, and were writing her death threats, because she dared to post on her blog that, \u201cHey, these are the works I\u2019ve written that are eligible for the award this year. If you like them, consider nominating them. [0:11:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">Which is so much milder than like, let\u2019s organize a voting blog, and here\u2019s a plate of like 12 people you should nominate, because it will piss off the liberals. And also when people bitched about Shawn being on the ballot, that\u2019s a time-honored commission; everyone gripes about the Hugo ballot, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">suddenly when it\u2019s women complaining about an advertent misogynist being on the ballot, like \u201cOh no, we don\u2019t understand how award nominating works.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">The double standard is so infuriating coming from someone who has positioned himself as an ally, and who has made money off of being an ally; like he edits anthologies of essays written by women and people of color, and promotes the man. Yes, I\u2019m glad he\u2019d putting our voices out there, and using his <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">platform for that, but he\u2019s also making money; he\u2019s also establishing a reputation, and generating goodwill. Then he turns around and (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562372\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">So anyway, there was a response, but I am \u2013 (sigh) I have a personal grudge against one of them, ever since the time he told me how I should feel about being a rape survivor. So (pause) although in this particular instance, he was not as terrible as the other; I hate him more. [0:12:50] (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">Then a bunch of people wrote about how what they were doing was not okay. But this was contributing to the problem; contributing to the marginalization of women some people call those voices. Then he collected six links to post criticizing him; posts them on his log, after he had just finished writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">on Twitter about he has 16,000 Twitter followers, and his blog has like 500,000 views this month. Which, just rub it in that you\u2019re platform is bigger than any of ours, why don\u2019t you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">He posted links to blogs of a bunch of friends of mine, including Vanessa and Kiki who I\u2019m very close to, and some other women who criticized his position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: What was the second name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Kiki.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: And was like, \u201cHey fans, some people disagree with me; you should go read their blog posts.\u201d Now all of my friends\u2019 blogs are being overrun by his fans who are trolls, and telling them that they are wrong in how there they criticized him, and don\u2019t they know that he\u2019s the best ally they\u2019ve ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">had, and blah, blah, blah. It\u2019s just \u2013 (sigh) it\u2019s wearisome. [0:14:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">And while all of this was going on, over Easter weekend, and Monday, and Tuesday, I was also reading submissions; I had something like 70 submissions to go through over the weekend. Most of them were really gross stories about boners basically. There was a whole 5,000 word pornographic rape fantasy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">And in the last 500 words, the thing that made it science fiction was that like some artificial intelligence that was in the camera, that was filming the rape decided that this was okay, and body-swapped the rapist and the victim. Then the rapist got to feel what it\u2019s like to be raped. That makes it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F2\">okay, apparently. I don\u2019t \u2013 [0:15:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">There were like masturbation fantasies, and there were like revenge fantasies, where a husband who feels like he\u2019s not appreciated enough, murders his wife. It was just an unending stream of like dudes and their boners being gross.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">So yeah, (pause). And then a coworker of mine at work decided he needed to regale me with stories about a now deceased coworkers boners. (pause) The guy, Neal, who I only met once,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: The deceased coworker?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. Apparently, he had pulmonary hypertension, which is a condition for which Viagra was originally developed to treat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: So, Josh told me all about how, you know, Neal had to deal with outraging boners at work that wouldn\u2019t go away, because of his hypertension. I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t know why he thought I needed to know that. [0:16:21] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s like men who either are throwing it in your face -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Because of course all the really gross stories were written by men; that kind of goes without saying. (pause) [0:18:00] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And in a way, it\u2019s kind of the same thing with this author and the (pause) like I don\u2019t have a (inaudible at 0:18:40), but the way that (pause) a big part of his sort of (pause) I can see the relation in that (inaudible at 0:19:07), the way he kind of professes to be genuinely kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">altruistically interested in like promoting the work and (inaudible at 0:19:21) as women and people of color in science fiction, is really quite self-evolved and self-serving.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562372\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And (pause) I guess one thing I\u2019m liking about the boner metaphor here is the way that it sort of like condenses both and kind of like self-involvement; like a masturbatory self-involvement, and the possibility of sexual aggression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: That those things kind of go together in the context that you\u2019re talking about.

(pause) [0:21:00] (pause) I\u2019m just so angry, and it\u2019s been so draining. (pause) [0:22:00] (pause) And like I realize I can just, you know, close the browser window and walk away, but friends of mine are getting harassing e-mails, and items, and letters in the mail, and I don\u2019t know, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">feel like it would make me a coward to just walk away; not think about it. Or at least not respond.

(pause) [0:25:00] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well the other thing that\u2019s been going on the last couple of weeks, is I\u2019m still doing the local story with Cricket, and Lucas, and her bullshit claims that he was emotionally abusing her, and then her claims that I abused her and how in a poetry book. I\u2019m like that\u2019s all I know in all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Now was Lucas the one who lives in Illinois, and has the daughter who has health problems?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, (sigh) (pause) the way Cricket has positioned herself as like the expert on sexual assaults in our community; and she actually is a state certified rape and crisis counselor. She\u2019s positioned herself as the expert, like this is how dealing with domestic violence and emotional violence <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">should be handled. [0:26:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">And so she\u2019s been bragging about how she managed to dismantle her PTSD triggers like in a day, and everything\u2019s fine now. When she discovers a trigger, she spindles it, and la, la, la. So (sigh) she has also been with more than one person I know, trying to for example, my friend Vanessa and Otis, have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">a very (sigh) I don\u2019t even know how to describe their relationship. They both have a lot of trauma from immigrating, and being Jews in Eastern Europe, and violent anti-Semitism. So sometimes they end up triggering each other\u2019s memories of bad things that happened in their youth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Are they together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yes. Their relationship has been very difficult, and they\u2019ve had a lot of work to do, and they are seeing a couples counselor there, but individually getting therapy. They are trying to do their best by each other, but it\u2019s hard. [0:27:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">But Cricket has tried to force Vanessa to accept the narrative of Vanessa and Otis\u2019s relationship parallel to narrative of Cricket and Emmett\u2019s and then Cricket and Lucas\u2019s relationship. And has been hinting at Vanessa that like maybe Vanessa should leave Otis, because Otis is abusive and (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">at 0:27:57) isn\u2019t abusive. Although Otis does things that hurts Vanessa, because -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562372\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Sure. That\u2019s clearly all Cricket\u2019s triggers in the example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, but this has Vanessa very upset. Danielle -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Sure; confusing enough without hearing that I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: So my friend Danielle was in a relationship with a violent alcoholic eight years ago, and she has not fully dealt with that. As far as I know, she has never sought therapy for it, and so she\u2019s dating someone new, who\u2019s very important to her. They recently moved in together, and her girlfriend <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">drinks. As far as I know, is not an alcoholic, but does get drunk occasionally. And when Eleanor gets drunk, Danielle has panic attacks. [0:28:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">But because Danielle is British, and stiff upper lip, and all of that, her panic attacks just \u2013 it\u2019s not really visible to people outside, that she\u2019s panicking, it just look like she\u2019s yelling at Eleanor for no reason. Now she is convinced that she is the abuser in that relationship, because \u2013 her trigger <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">should be dismantled, because it\u2019s been eight years. And it\u2019s just like \u2013 (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">I\u2019m so angry at Cricket, because she has at this point, four friends and I who are convinced that they are horrible people, and they\u2019re abusing their partners, because of things Cricket has said to them about her and Lucas, and her and Emmett. Even though, as far as I know, I\u2019m not inside any of these <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">relationships, so what do I know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">But as far as I can tell, maybe not all of these relationships are healthy, but there\u2019re not all \u2013 there\u2019s not abuse going on. There\u2019s a spectrum of like, this relationship is a bad idea, and this [overlapping conversation at 0:29:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Sure, and you have good reasons and you are suspicious of Cricket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. So there\u2019s been \u2013 I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with friends of mine, and they\u2019re all like abuse, and trauma histories, and it\u2019s been a lot to cope with. Anyway, people are talking about Cricket and how we think she\u2019s full of shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">And a bunch of editors have blacklisted her now, because of her whole, \u201cI don\u2019t want my work to be on the Internet anymore, I want it to be pulled down; I want to break all these contracts that I signed, and have you take down my work that you paid for. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to call you an abuser.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">Well, shockingly, editors don\u2019t want to deal with that shit. So her work has started getting rejected in a lot of places. There\u2019re two magazines I know of that have asked her to \u2013 where she had like guest editing gigs lined up over the span of the next year, that have asked her not to do that many. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">But that\u2019s basically taken \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the correct reserve is there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Withdraw their offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, withdraw their offer, to let her guess that it\u2019s an issue. So yesterday she went on Twitter, and accused Lucas of raping her. And I know you should always (inaudible at 0:30:59) the victim; I know that culture says that (sigh) it\u2019s easy to believe men aren\u2019t rapists, when they really are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">And the whole \u2013 I feel really bad about it, but I don\u2019t believe her. I think she\u2019s lying, because she realizes that she is very rapidly losing social and political capital, and she wants to get people to feel sorry for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562372\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: But yeah. (pause) She\u2019s lied about so many things; she\u2019s lied about me. (pause) I went back and I looked at her response to \u2013 she e-mailed her response when I asked her out last winter. So all this time, I had been remembering it as, she said maybe, maybe not, ask me later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I remember, yeah. [0:32:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: But when I looked at the actual e-mail, and sent it to a trusted friend of mine, and said \u201cAm I crazy? Was this an outright no? Like should I have just dropped it immediately?\u201d Kiki\u2019s response was like, \u201cNo, that actually sounds like a yes to me. If I had received that e-mail, I would have assumed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">that she wanted to date me, and would have pursued actually meeting up in person to talk about it like very aggressively.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">I was like, \u201cOh, well.\u201d But apparently, Cricket\u2019s been telling people that I have a crush on her, and she feels nothing for me. So, I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t trust her; she\u2019s a liar. And I feel bad, because, you know, there\u2019s a tendency in our culture to believe women are lying when they say they\u2019re raped. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">That\u2019s a serious problem. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">I want to always believe someone who says that they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted, but I don\u2019t believe Cricket, and that\u2019s really upsetting to me. [0:33:26]-[0:34:26] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) all right, let me be clear about this. So, I think in telling Cricket in both of the incidents that you have, (pause) the one with the author?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And then with Cricket. I think there are things about coping it all; like about what\u2019s going on that feel to you, or that kind of (inaudible at 0:35:59) sort of abusive; you\u2019re not saying they\u2019re abusing you, and I\u2019m not talking about like in some sense what\u2019s going on in like external reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">But the extent of your helplessness; the sense of your being kind of helpless, maybe even bound, and like, you know, [treats you] (ph) aggressively, intrusively, hurtfully, the way you feel silenced. Or very mixed about taking care of yourself, or speaking up in a way, remind me of abuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">I\u2019m not sure what to make of that, or what the ramifications of that are; like what that \u2013 why? But I\u2019m struck by it. And again, I hope I\u2019m being clear in sort of differentiating like your internal experience of those things from -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: (pause) Like the kind of external situations that you\u2019re describing. (pause) [0:37:59] (pause) And I suppose, as I think more about it, (pause) rather they feel abusive in somewhat different ways; one is the more sort of stereotypically male boner in your face, self-involved and aggressive <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F51\">at the same time, sort of. Then the other is, more the (pause) I guess in a way, you could say like, again I wouldn\u2019t say abusing female, I would just say more like a stereotypically borderline; not you, but the other person; kind of (pause) gas lighting, crazy-making, aghhh; sort of play the victim <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F52\">in this really aggressive way; sort of perform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:39:22] (pause) It\u2019s been really frustrating and upsetting.
