None of those people would let you make a left turn. If you\u2019re going like this, the people coming this way just refused to leave a gap for that left turn, even though <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">they couldn\u2019t go anywhere because they had gridlocked. Just because, I guess, people enjoy being dicks and making everyone else suffer as much as they do. (sighs) But I\u2019m here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Glad you made it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: (sighs) Yesterday was a work-from-home day, obviously, because of the snow and I got almost nothing done. I tried; I really tried. (sighs) My boss, Chris, has Brian and me working on the same task: Come up with a spreadsheet to detail in minute, fine-grained detail how much area we\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">to need.  Brian fucking refuses to store the spreadsheet on a network file drive, network file system or SharePoint, or any of the places where I can access it. So he sends me copies to work with infrequently, and so then I work with a copy and then we do work in parallel and then I send him my work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">and he is like, \u201cWell this is out of date because I was working while you were working.\u201d It\u2019s really frustrating. I can\u2019t get any traction. It\u2019s really demoralizing and unmotivating. And then then Brian complains that he feels overwhelmed and has too much work. I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, you\u2019re the one who is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">refusing to fucking delegate to your junior engineer on this. If you shit on my work and whenever I give you work you tell me that it\u2019s out of date, even though I was working at the exact same hour that you were, what the fuck can I do?\u201d (sighs) So it\u2019s demoralizing. The other thing I need to work on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">is just the tool-set issue and I can\u2019t get any traction on it. I needed help from someone more senior than me yesterday because I couldn\u2019t figure out the error messages I was seeing or why I was getting them or how to fix them and I kind of flailed with it. (sighs) And then I fell asleep at like 3:30 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">and didn\u2019t wake up until 8:00, so there is the day \u2013 gone. I just wanted to cook because today is the International Festival which the [AMB] (ph?) Women\u2019s Forum runs. Have I bitched about this yet? No? AMB Women\u2019s Forum runs the International Festival and I really, really resent the fact that the women <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">are explicitly expected to run the social events that cater to the emotional and social needs of our male colleagues. Our site director is the one \u2013 who is a guy \u2013 who told the AMB Women\u2019s Forum to run the International Festival five years ago, and we\u2019ve been in charge of it ever since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: So are you wearing aprons or something? It\u2019s ridiculous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Most of the women are responsible for decorating a table for a country and there is also gross [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:09) cultural preparation going on there. Yeah. We have to organize teams and I couldn\u2019t get anyone from my team, except this one dude in the cubicle next to me, and that\u2019s only <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">because my team is Tunisia because the Indians decided that their team was big enough and that having an Thai on the Malaysian team would be ridiculous \u2013 so Tunisia because being married to someone from Tunisia is just like being from Tunisia yourself. Anyway, the guy sitting next to me overheard me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">talking about this and was like, \u201cMy wife is Tunisian. I can totally have her cook and bring stuff in.\u201d So my plan yesterday was to go to the grocery store at 6:30, get food, cook from 7:30 to 10:00, be done, go to sleep. I slept until 8:00 and finally made it to the grocery store at 9:00, started cooking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">at 10:30, was done at 1:00.  I\u2019m exhausted. I have three trays of Baklava and four eggplants [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:08) and a big stack of pita bread from the store. I did not make pita bread. I kind of resent this whole exercise. It\u2019s really shitty. And then after work I get to go hang out with Yvonne <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">and her screaming child. (pause) I hate [decorating.] (ph?) (pause) I am not convinced that my complaining was particularly useful, but I seem to be out of steam now.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562172\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:48). (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really tired of feeling unproductive at work and like I can\u2019t get anything done. (pause) Yesterday, while I was completely failing to get traction on work, I looked at Ravelry, which is a social-networking site for knitters. I don\u2019t know if I have described it to you before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Ravelry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yes, Ravelry. It has lots of databases of hundreds of thousands of knitting patterns and types of yarn so you can look up specs for almost anything that\u2019s been published in like the last 40 years. People have put in a massive effort to digitize and upload patterns that are out of copyright and, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">at least, get information about publisher and where to buy patterns that are still under copyright.  There is a database of all the stuff out there in the world and then each user can keep their own journal of patterns they want to knit, patterns they are in the midst of knitting, projects that they\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">already made, what yarn you own. And then there are discussion groups and forums and joined-interest groups. There is a group for knitters who live in Cheshire and a group for knitters who are Harvard alumni and there is a group for knitters who use such-and-such online games and so on and so forth. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">Then there are competitions and prizes and, of course, there is advertising; it\u2019s the Internet. I was browsing Ravelry and realized that sign-ups were open for Sock Madness, which is a ridiculous competition that I used to participate in before grad school ate my life. I haven\u2019t really been on Ravelry <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D4\">at all since before grad school, really. I had no time in grad school and then didn\u2019t go back to it. I don\u2019t know what prompted me to go back.  That is a lie; someone on Twitter posted a link to one of their projects on Ravelry and I followed the link and I wasn\u2019t getting anything at work and wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D5\">distractions. I started browsing. So I signed up for Sock Madness, which is probably a mistake. The idea is it\u2019s a speed knitting competition over the span of three months. You are given eight patterns at regular intervals and there are eliminations. In the first round, the first hundred people who <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D6\">finish move onto the next round; and in the second round, the first 80 people who finish go onto the next. The patterns are a surprise. They\u2019re generally incredibly technically challenging. When I was unemployed this was great fun. It gave me something to do. I\u2019m afraid it might drive me a little neurotic <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D7\">trying to finish all of the patterns in time, but I signed up anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562172\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">THERAPIST: When does it start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">CLIENT: In March. After I finished cooking last night . . . I have a lot of \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say manic energy because I feel like manic is actually a term that has critical definitions and I\u2019m not sure if it meets it or not \u2013 unpleasant, nervous energy; and I couldn\u2019t sleep, even though I was exhausted. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">I went and dumped out all of the yarn in my big bucket, like a half-gallon tub of yarn, and sorted through it and compared it to the list of materials for Sock Madness and created a spreadsheet of Sock Madness. They give you a list of materials for each pattern, but not the pattern. There is enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200212\">information about the patterns that you can make guesses about what sorts of things will be going on. So I created a big spreadsheet of what I have versus what I need and tried to match up, instead of just going to bed like a reasonable person because, by that point, it was 2:00 in the morning.  (long <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200213\">pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: I guess what I\u2019m thinking about is the way that I think when you get shut down around doing your work or, at least, yesterday and at some other times, you sort of veer into something that feels like a better compromise of an activity that is enjoyment or fulfilling, in a way \u2013 like the cooking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">and the knitting stuff.  I was imagining that there is a parallel process that happens, like kind of how you\u2019re talking in here and there is something about the talking about the trouble at work that I think you also feel shut down around; like hard to know what to do next or what to say, feelings are <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">so [compacted] (ph?) or something.  Then I imagine one of the things that feels easier to talk about, but not necessarily feels to you \u2013 I want to be very clear that I\u2019m saying to you and not to me \u2013 like the right thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: And I imagine that there is that sense of demand like we were talking about yesterday where you feel this demand, I imagine partly in the air more than from me to be like you should be talking about work and you should be making progress on it and you should be da-da-da.  That\u2019s part of what gets overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Pretty sure that\u2019s coming from me and not from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I guess what I have in mind is not whether you think it\u2019s coming from me, but whether it\u2019s projected somewhere and, if so, where. That\u2019s what I have in mind. We\u2019re going to have to stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry I was so late. I should have predicted that with the snow traffic it would be stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
