[0:01:04] I think\u2014[we even talked about it] (ph) a little bit. I\u2019ve been really, really angry about (pause)\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s really functionally\u2014the series of interactions that we\u2019ve had about time hasn\u2019t had too profound <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">an impact on time that I have or don\u2019t have. But it\u2019s been very profound as a matter of legitimacy, [I mean] (ph) the legitimacy of working on this or that. [0:01:55] And this (pause) interaction we had on Monday, she sent me a really obnoxious e-mail while she was in the kitchen and I was in my office, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">asking me why I wasn\u2019t working better and making more productive use of her parents, that I was being\u2014I mean, there were a number of things that were upsetting. And I think I mentioned them on Tuesday. I think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: You mentioned\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I mentioned that we\u2019d had a fight. Well, I just (pause) (exhaling)\u2014I\u2019ve been really angry. I\u2019ve been really angry about the delegitimation of this thing that we agreed on in September, would be half of what I was thinking of myself as doing. [0:02:58] (Pause) (Exhaling) I haven\u2019t been able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">sleep. I\u2019ve been going to bed angry. Yeah, it\u2019s been very difficult for me to fall asleep. And at one point I woke her up, and I just said, I\u2019m mad. It\u2019s not very passive-aggressive (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: And this morning she was like\u2014I don\u2019t know, Grayson went down for a nap for 20 minutes or so. And I said, well, I (ph) really should take a nap. And (pause) then he woke up after 20 minutes. And she said, hey, can you take this? And (pause) I feel like we\u2019ve been in a very mutually supportive <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">mode. [0:04:00] And she just kind of disassembled it. She said very explicitly, okay, well\u2014in a way that was really deeply upsetting and painful given how moved and (pause) hopeful I\u2019d been at her having taken the opposite approach previously. I just felt so betrayed by this. And I felt like, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">feel mutually supportive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">Under normal circumstances and for all of our relationship really, I have felt like we\u2019re in this together. These things are not zero sum. When you need something, it\u2019s not as if it diminishes me and my sleep. But I didn\u2019t\u2014it felt very zero sum all of a sudden. [0:04:59] (Exhaling) (Pause) And I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">said, alright, I\u2019m doing this, but I\u2019m not okay with it. And then I brought him in our bedroom, and I said, we\u2019re going to have to entertain him together. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to handle being angry in this way, and I don\u2019t know how to handle (pause)\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And I thought to myself, among other things, over the course of kind of examining my (pause)\u2014I don\u2019t know, both, I guess, my feelings and my behavior, trying to find something, a way of relating that didn\u2019t feel too extreme and yet succeeded in expressing the\u2014honestly and with some integrity the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">that our interactions are impressing themselves on me. [0:06:24] I thought to myself, well, Marshall really kind of was off the mark, I guess, about the sense of resentment with regard to him. But I feel deeply resentful in a way that I think is\u2014goes well beyond what I\u2019m talking about now toward Jennie <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">for having a place. And I feel deep resentment against all of my friends and acquaintances and colleagues who share their professional development with me in whatever way. [0:06:59] I do feel real enmity (ph) in that respect.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562356\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">And so it occurred to me that, to the extent that we\u2019re engaging in transference (chuckling), that might be a plausible\u2014that might be a model that I can really get behind. This is something that\u2019s very active and powerful for me right now, this sense of resentment, in this interaction more than all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">others, I would imagine. And so to the extent that that may have seeped through somehow in our exchange, that seems like something that\u2019s plausible and worth talking about. (Pause) And I\u2019m angry at Jennie in this regard on reflection only insofar as, in this series of exchanges, she has either been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">(pause) blithely uncomprehending or kind of actively (pause)\u2014we\u2019ll go with blithely uncomprehending of how difficult this is for me. [0:08:19] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">And what she keeps on saying, she says, I\u2019m working full time, so you need to support all of these things that I\u2019m doing. (Pause) I\u2019m not going to support these non-remunerative activities that you\u2019re engaged in. (Pause) [0:08:54] And then it\u2019s kind of a mind fuck because she denies that remuneration <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">was the criterion for whether some\u2014she keeps on saying, well, how can I take care of the baby? I\u2019ve got time and a half. And I say, listen, A, whatever. I mean, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m litigating it with you. But (pause) the thrust or implication of what she says about time and a half and the thrust or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">implication of what she says about, well, this is my job and this is your job, is to say that you don\u2019t have a job. You don\u2019t have a vocation. You don\u2019t have this. And when I say that this is painful she just completely doesn\u2019t comprehend it or won\u2019t comprehend it or won\u2019t discuss this. Anyway, we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">going to see Elizabeth on Tuesday. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Yeah, I was\u2014yeah. I had in mind as you were talking, I wonder if it would be helpful to see Elizabeth again. (Pause) [0:10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: But I feel this deep resentment and this very (pause) painful intersection between that intervention\u2014well, between that resentment and the inevitable negotiation around Grayson\u2019s care. (Pause) Even if we\u2019re doing great, even if we really are feeling very mutually supportive, it\u2019s a negotiation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">It\u2019s like, I\u2019m tired. Can you take him, right? Just at the most sort of practical, pragmatic, non-conceptual level, that\u2019s a kind of negotiation. [0:10:53] And the way in which she has dealt with the stress of navigating all of these things has really made my sense of (pause) upheaval and disruption <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">much more profound. I mean, that would be my gloss on the resentment, is that I know I feel completely at loose ends. I feel in real distress. And it\u2019s really exacerbated my distress in this particular area to a considerable degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m losing you a little bit. What I get is that of course there\u2019s inevitably negotiation around Grayson\u2019s care, and of course you feel quite betrayed because she\u2019s singing a very different tune about (crosstalk)\u2026 [0:12:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: She set me up. She totally set me up. She said, okay, great, do this. And then when I did this she formulated it in a way that completely delegitimizes half of what I wanted to do. (Pause) But I mean, my understanding of what\u2019s going on on her end, to the extent that I have the capacity for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">empathy as I still do, is that she\u2019s very worried. She\u2019s very worried about whether she\u2019ll be able to get work done. She has trouble writing in general. [0:12:58] And the one thing that she wrote in the last few months was this book review that she\u2019d been supposed to do for three years, ever since I\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">known her. And the only way she got it done was by me very mutually supportively pushing her. This was right before my mother came, right around the time that she did a turnabout. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562356\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">At any rate, she feels stressed about that. She feels burdened by the presumably temporary prospect of being the sole breadwinner, of having her professional success, having the viability of our household dependent on her professional success. [0:13:58] And so in response to the stress she has made <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">this intervention. But it was a completely self-defeating one. (Pause) [0:15:00] (Exhaling) So (pause) here I feel a little bit of righteous anger, I guess. With regard to this resentment, I do not feel righteous anger. I feel conflicted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">On the one hand it seems unfair to me in a cosmic sense that I don\u2019t have a place. [0:15:55] On the other hand I\u2019m aware that the way that I\u2019m engaging has really been substantially responsible for that fact. I mean, I take\u2014for that ultimately I have to look at myself in the face every morning, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">it\u2019s clear to me that I have been largely responsible for the difficulty that I\u2019m having, finding a place now. There are some things that I don\u2019t have very good executive control over that I think are embroiled in this process. So it\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve made a conscious decision to alienate or feel alienated, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">I guess more precisely, from all these kinds of social interactions. [0:16:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">But ultimately the proximal cause of this sense that I have with being at loose ends is me. That\u2019s why I come here, because I feel like I don\u2019t have good control over this thing that I\u2019m doing. So in that sense the resentment\u2014in some cosmic sense I feel unfairness. In a more rational sense I feel (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">a sense of responsibility. And that makes me\u2014the sort of incommensurability of those two ways of understanding fairness really\u2014I mean, it\u2019s two completely different criteria for judging what\u2019s fair and what\u2019s not. The difficulty reconciling them, I guess, is kind of confusing. [0:18:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">So at the end of the day I just\u2014my resentment confuses me and makes me feel uncomfortable and conflicted. And that sense of confusion or conflict also makes the interaction with Jennie much more difficult, because she\u2019s really hit me exactly where it hurts. And then I think\u2014a moment ago when I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">well, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s blithely uncomprehending or whatever, I do wonder whether the fact that she\u2019s hitting me exactly where it hurts is completely accidental. (Pause) I don\u2019t know what to make of that. That sounds like something for tomorrow (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) (Pause) [0:19:00] [0:20:00] I guess I\u2019m struck by a few things. (Pause) One of them is, again\u2014[I guess this came up a few weeks ago] (ph), in spite of all of this, you don\u2019t sound or seem particularly Jeffreyish. You\u2019re\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Tuesday at the end I was Jeffreyish. But yeah. (Pause) Now I\u2019m not. Now I feel very\u2014I feel some clarity about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562356\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you sound clear-headed. (Pause) [0:21:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Anger is very deranging for me. And combined with additional sleep deprivation you can imagine what it\u2019s like at 3:00 AM. But I don\u2019t feel very Jeffreyish. I feel there\u2019s a clarity in anger (pause), I guess, although I guess I just contradict myself in the space of two sentences. No, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">very clear-headed. I guess that\u2019s curious or interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: I mean, I guess the one thing that seems Jeffreyish in all of this really is your difficulty getting to the applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: I got to them yesterday. I mean, I haven\u2019t actually sent any? But I got to them. We can talk about that. [0:21:56] (Pause) The very beginning stages of them, but nonetheless (pause)\u2026 I mean, the fucked up thing\u2014and I\u2019m just sort of a little circular\u2014indulging in a little circular thinking here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">I mean, the fucked up thing is that I feel like, rightly or wrongly, I was really ready to get to them in January when I sat down with Jennie and we had this conversation. And I said, I need 15 hours a week, etcetera. I was there. I was ready to do it. I felt very full-hearted (ph) about it. It felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">like a mutually supportive activity. It felt like it was in keeping with the timetable. It all felt good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">And she kind of blew it up. And my read, which is probably a little bit skewed toward, I don\u2019t know (chuckling), self-validation, but not entirely, is that I got so angry at this betrayal that I just couldn\u2019t do it. [0:23:10] And the way that I am, as we\u2019ve had ample opportunity to see (chuckling), <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">is that I\u2019m not totally aware of what\u2014the anger kind of comes out of nowhere for me. (Pause) In other words it deranges my process, but it makes me feel as if there\u2019s something wrong with me. It\u2019s like Isaac\u2014 Isaac. I haven\u2019t done that\u2014 Grayson had a little fever yesterday, last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Who is Isaac?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Theo is my nephew. We did not think about this when we came up with Grayson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:23:53).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). [0:23:59] Oh right, I mean, he has a fever. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But he\u2019s just kind of deranged. He\u2019s all crying, and (pause) that\u2019s the way it is for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: With the anger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: With the anger. I feel like something\u2019s wrong with me. It feels\u2014it strikes me as an illness, the anger. And I don\u2019t really know where it\u2019s coming from. (Pause) But anyway, that seems to me the most plausible explanation for this latest bout of\u2014and maybe for all the bouts. Maybe the only thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">that\u2019s different here is the object of my anger. Maybe all along my difficulty applying for things and my difficulty with this or that has been about this anger, with different objects. [0:25:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: It seems that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: I could probably identify the object in each case. But it\u2019s weird that there\u2019s this continuity in the impact on me most of all, though all of the referents change (pause), obviously because the anger is (inaudible at 0:25:29) each time (chuckling). The referent of the anger, the object of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">anger is\u2014but I don\u2019t know, that (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) one could imagine saying (ph) sometimes it\u2019s anger or sometimes it\u2019s sadness or\u2014but it\u2019s anger.

And I\u2019m able to sustain that affinity even in the midst of\u2014that\u2019s another way of saying that I have clarity of thought.

And you sound grounded and not abstract at all in talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">about all of that.

[0:31:09] I don\u2019t know, is that a viable proposition?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562356\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: Right, I mean, sort of in\u2014in theory that\u2019s plausible. I\u2019m just saying in practice, the way I always see it and think about it, is that if there\u2019s something that remains\u2014assuming that is yet unintegrated, that could be, and that in a sense the symptom always has something very important to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: That\u2014(chuckling) we\u2019re very much as one on that.

So that is significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Maybe partly because I\u2019m standing up for the importance and communicative\u2026 [0:32:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Maybe. What I was responding to was your sense that the symptom\u2014I mean, this model of the universe that you have is very persuasive and appealing to me (chuckling). I think that makes very good sense. And I guess it\u2019s moving because it\u2019s explanatory. It\u2019s helpful. I mean, it makes sense of something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">that, for me as I say, is an expression of completely irrational, very compulsive irrational things that I don\u2019t have much control over, and it makes sense of them. So I think that that\u2014being in consensus on that point is important at a very profound level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">At any rate, I don\u2019t know. I mean, the part about assuming\u2014I don\u2019t want to get into an abstract discussion. [0:33:01] But a part about assuming that, basically if I understand you correctly, when there is such an unintegrated feeling it necessarily has to be in the same dimension as the other feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">or in the same personality matrix. That I\u2019m not so sure. I just\u2014I don\u2019t know. I mean, there are things that are difficult to imagine that happen in this space I imagine (chuckling). And I would guess that it happens in many different ways. But maybe you\u2019re right. I just don\u2019t know what it would\u2014if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200852\">are right, and as I say, this was just speculation and is not a train of thought. It\u2019s just something that popped randomly into my head. I don\u2019t know what it would be. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s left. [0:33:55] I don\u2019t know what\u2019s not uncovered, what\u2019s left uncovered at this point\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even know what manner of thing we\u2019re talking about here. I do know that there was so much disruption and chaos in the earliest part of my life, that not really having a very good model in my head of how personalities become integrated, I can\u2019t really say. But it seems, just kind of in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200891\">the most speculative possible sense, plausible that there may have been some interference in the process of integrating infantile feelings and experiences into this unitary consciousness. Again, I\u2019m just really kind of whistling in the dark here. [0:34:59] I don\u2019t know whether that helps at all. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200892\">the\u2014what I do remember\u2014let me put it this way, just getting back to more concrete things. When Isaac was born, I was seeing shrink #1.

So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay, sure, obviously. (Pause) And to some degree it\u2019s a confidence game.

In other words the sense of confidence was an expression of our relation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I haven\u2019t seen the thing about which I think we\u2019re going to be confident yet.

I\u2019m probably being\u2014so (pause) I guess it seems\u2014okay, my sense of what moved you a few minutes ago was my articulating a model in which your derangement makes sense and also has an important value. [0:39:14] It\u2019s not just some random reaction you have, but that there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">are important things that you feel and that have happened to you and that are sort of going on with people in the present that are part of that reaction.

But maybe I (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right. I mean, that thought is something that\u2019s just a kind of basic premise that we\u2019ve had all along. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly new. There was just something about the terms\u2014I mean, you expressed this cosmologically\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Yes, I did.

Thirty months, we have not yet touched on. Something is still there under the surface. [0:41:59] And the symptom is getting at it. And I desperately want to get at it.

(Pause) [0:42:57] And I guess when I say that I feel (pause), I don\u2019t know\u2014(laughing) it\u2019s funny to say that I feel a strategic alliance between <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C51\">us because I guess that\u2019s kind of the premise of psychotherapy in some sense. But I feel like we\u2019re on the same page there, yeah. I guess that might be one further implication. I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I just had this sense that there\u2019s something else.
