AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: Well, what\u2019s happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know where to begin. So probably best place is present moment, which is just trying to figure out where I\u2019m at present moment-wise, which is probably going to the course or the session. Where I\u2019m at this morning is Lieutenant Dans (ph) strapped to the mast of the boat raging against the storm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: [Laughs] Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: That\u2019s where I\u2019m at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a good thing that I get the movie reference because whenever, I find whenever I use movie reference in classes all of mine are from the 90s and the 80s so that\u2019s pretty I got that one. That\u2019s my genre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s like there\u2019s nothing more raw than Lieutenant Dans (ph) screaming at the storm, so. Yes, and I\u2019m remembering a sentence from a few sessions back, how would I know you\u2019re angry? Well I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m in this place physically showing it but it\u2019s palpable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I can see it. What\u2019s been happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Why don\u2019t you take me, if you can, can you take me back to where we last, our last session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yes. Well we were talking a lot, I mean you kind of surprisingly told me that you had a discussion with your wife and you talked a bit about being unhappy. And she acknowledged that but then it was kind of dropped. I also remember that she had an opportunity to continue the conversation when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">you went to go see your kid at Indiana University, right? And she chose to drive with a friend instead and so I think that\u2019s where we were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yes. Okay. Yes, so that weekend, that weekend I went to see the kids, so I had an opportunity to see my son Harry in Maroa. And he had a conference; I stayed over with him. Lovely, lovely evening. Went out to dinner or went out to breakfast. Went out to dinner when my daughter came over. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">we, I had an opportunity to connect with all the kids. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: And was it just you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: It was just me because my wife was at this conference with her friend and then we all converged at Indiana University Sunday afternoon. My son was in a show. I didn\u2019t know the show. The show was A Little Night Music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay, I\u2019m not familiar and I\u2019m a musical I love musicals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes, me too, and I said here\u2019s a Steven Sondheim I\u2019ve never seen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Interesting. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s where the song \u201cSend In the Clowns\u201d comes from. Okay, and it\u2019s all about these love triangles of people in unhappy marriages and mistresses and here\u2019s my son playing me on stage. And I said, oh God, this is really oh the irony here is too thick for me to even sit in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Tell me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: [Laughs] Yes, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s much more to tell other than that but hearing \u201cSend In the Clowns\u201d will never sound the same again. So it\u2019s just like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like a punch to the gut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. And then yes. So then it\u2019s recognizing the lid is just coming off of the pressure cooker. Another image that I have is I am, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s terribly unpleasant, but just vomiting up emotion and it\u2019s so the best that I can be is restrained but I\u2019ve recognized that I\u2019ve been having <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">these physical reactions. I can feel it. It\u2019s like being with the sensations of the body and <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: What physical reactions are you having?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Just a lot of tension. I recognize the closer I drive to going home it\u2019s just this buildup of tension. It\u2019s just such a, yes, a visceral feeling. So give me a second to try to pull it together but I\u2019m trying to remember a series of events. So that was that weekend. I think that, I\u2019m just going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">to throw stuff out there. At this point it just feels like [laughing] no movie reference but just this visual of I got these puzzle pieces and I\u2019m just throwing them on the table like I don\u2019t know what. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">So there\u2019s this sense of okay, it\u2019s not unreasonable to want to have a relationship with emotional and physical intimacy. This is crazy, and there\u2019s just all this anger just kind of building up and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s all the anger you\u2019ve been holding back for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Oh my God, decades. And it\u2019s probably anger that predates my marriage. I don\u2019t know. And then, yes I don\u2019t know if I can really remember if there were other significant events of that week. But the weekend for Christmas this year we\u2019ve decided not to buy gifts. We ended up buying a season subscription <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">to Broadway on Detroit. So we got tickets and we ended up going to the first one of those shows on Sunday night. And we ended up going to dinner ahead of time and I was just in this place of kind of now, kind of this, but we\u2019re in this public place and it doesn\u2019t take a brain surgeon to know that there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">something wrong. So she\u2019s asking me so what\u2019s going on. And I say, recognizing that I\u2019m trying to jump back into those old patterns of, I\u2019m not saying the words but they\u2019re right there, nothing\u2019s wrong; I\u2019m fine. But I\u2019m not going there so I\u2019m just sitting with it and there\u2019s maybe some awkward silence <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">but I was finally, and again I\u2019m not going to be able to give this verbatim or anything like that, but I was able in probably choppy sentences and language able to get out expressing just all this anger that I\u2019m feeling about <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">And again I wish I had my recorder so that I could\u2019ve gone back and replayed what was it that you were really able to say. But I know that words, probably like the bullet point that you could\u2019ve used for the 6:00 news, was that I was able to say I\u2019m in a three-person relationship and I\u2019m the odd man <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">out. And I did say seven or eight years ago you hauled down the flag from the flagship and you transferred it to Lisa\u2019s house and you\u2019ve left me here with nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s amazing and very powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: And, so I know that that was kind of like where, I may recall other things that I was able to say, but for me it was like okay. And at the point that I was saying it, there was I don\u2019t remember this sense of being out of control. It was more a sense of there was almost just calm determination. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I\u2019m saying this. I just kind of leaned into it a little bit and it was okay and as a matter of fact it was like wow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Wow is right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: You know, the anticipation of saying that was far worse than saying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: So what not only enabled you to do that but what enabled you to do that and then what reaction did you get?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: What enabled me I think just the work that we\u2019ve been doing, pushing the canoe (ph), sitting with this, I think coming to some kind of resolve but I don\u2019t know when that happened. But I got to this point and I remember saying it out loud, dammit, I\u2019m going to get intimacy back into my life. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">And this is not an unreasonable thing for me to want. And so I\u2019ve got to do something; I\u2019ve got to take some action to make this happen. And recognizing that sitting on my emotions and being dishonest with myself is not going to get me there. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What reaction did you get?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I think initially there was the sense of, because there was some talk about kind of where this is coming from but it\u2019s kind of like the process I\u2019m talking about, that through work that I\u2019m doing with individual counseling and stuff like that. There was this sense of like oh I\u2019m really so happy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">for you that you\u2019re doing this and it\u2019ll be not that those were the words but the essence was it\u2019ll be so great when you finally get all fixed and come back and everything will be hunky-dory. And it was just like, that was like throwing gasoline on the fire. And I said -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Oh yes, sure. That made it much worse; I can see that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Oh my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yes, well it\u2019s patronizing. You go do your job and you just get that fixed with your little counseling program over there and when you\u2019re all fixed come back and we\u2019ll go back to the way we were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Right. And it\u2019s just, I recognize that just kind of enflamed the torch or the fire. And then I also recognized that the other kicker in that was that whenever we talk about intimacy -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: You and she?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s like we\u2019re not talking the same language. And she\u2019s says, she\u2019s starting to get a little defensive and the tears are welling up and that kind of thing and she says but all of the things that I do for you to show you how much I care; my love and affection for you and all of the intimacy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">that I give you, you\u2019re just not there for that. I said well tell me what that looks like because I believe that that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do but I don\u2019t know what that looks like. And she says well I give you a kiss in the morning on my way out the door and I tell you I love you. And it just came <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">out of my mouth and I said yes, but you know what that looks like to me? That\u2019s just a reminder of all the things that I don\u2019t have in my life. It\u2019s just like, well that was probably not the most sensitive thing to say at moment but it was <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It was deeply honest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: I get a peck on the cheek and that\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right. And Lisa gets the emotional intimacy that you\u2019re missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes. And then it was kind of I recognized that that was as far as she could go at that moment and she kind of went into this place of and it was also time for us to move to the show. But then it became mindless conversation about this and that and she was fiddling on the phone and looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">at Facebook and telling me about this and that. I was just like before that though, I was saying that we were talking about physical intimacy. So that conversation then spilled into whenever we\u2019re talking about intimacy it\u2019s automatically it\u2019s about sexual intimacy. And I said you\u2019re not hearing me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">you\u2019re not hearing me. And I get it, I get that her fear of sexual intimacy is so deep that that\u2019s but she started talking about our sexual intimacy in terms of past tense, as in completely past tense. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Give me some verbiage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: We had a really wonderful sexual intimacy in our life; we have three wonderful kids. Not necessarily that she said these words but that\u2019s over now and I can\u2019t go there anymore. And it\u2019s kind of like, it sort of happened at that moment but the stone that kind of got pushed over there it took <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">a while before that started to roll into an avalanche and it just like wow, okay that\u2019s been my experience for the last seven years but that\u2019s never been stated. That\u2019s never been stated like yes, this is completely over. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: And how did you react to her sentence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: I had this image that I\u2019m the guy that\u2019s been sitting at the railway station for the last seven years waiting for the train to show up. And I said dude, what a dumb ass. This train is not even coming back and you\u2019re still sitting at the chain, at the station.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You sat at the station for some very good reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes, I get that but I mean that\u2019s where the anger is at. And this morning it was, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m just trying to decide if that\u2019s the chain of events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Even out of sequence, it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: So I get the fact that all of this emotion is out there and I know it\u2019s got to be scaring the living bejesus out of her because I\u2019m shifting paradigms in a pretty big way and I recognize that that may not have been my intention. I didn\u2019t want to hit the plunger but there you go. I put the nuclear <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">option on the table. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">And again, where did this conversation fit into it? I\u2019m not 100% sure but I was able to say you know what, I need physical and emotional intimacy in my life and I\u2019m no longer willing to live without it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: And that was a conversation that happened around the kitchen table maybe yesterday or the day before, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know. It all started to, and I recognized it this emotional rage or whatever that I\u2019m in right now, I\u2019m just puking up junk and I\u2019m sorry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Emotional honesty, it\u2019s not junk Seamus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not junk. It\u2019s the truth that\u2019s always been there that she has ignored because it was convenient and you\u2019ve been trying to ignore so you didn\u2019t have to have the conversation. So although I imagine it\u2019s a deeply painful space, it\u2019s a cathartic space because this is all the stuff that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">you\u2019ve been holding in. And it\u2019s in some ways it\u2019s unfair that you\u2019re the one who has to hold it and she lives from the benefits of your holding it. And you shouldn\u2019t have to hold it anymore because you\u2019re not asking for anything unreasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Well I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t and it\u2019s coming out. And I get that that\u2019s painful for me and her and everybody else. It\u2019s just like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: But it needed to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: but I\u2019m done. At some point, I don\u2019t know why, but it was just and I have kind of shut out music a lot in my life over the past seven years and I don\u2019t know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: No, you know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Well, I shut down everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well not only that but you guys met around music, music is what sometimes pulls her away from you. I mean I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Okay. You know what? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yes, I mean, and so, and whenever you are forced to connect, it\u2019s forced to connect instead of wanting it\u2019s around music or her concerts or her deciding what you\u2019re going to do. So I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: And music is of course touches the emotional cores, so why the hell put yourself there? Whether it\u2019s classical music or country music or whatever. I fired up an old Johnny Cash the last Johnny Cash album. He did a cover of Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down.\u201d And I just like playing that. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">it bumps up against his cover of Nine Inch Nails \u201cHurt,\u201d which is just so incredibly raw that I\u2019m like okay I\u2019m not sure even I can go here today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: So you said to her I\u2019m not going to put up with this anymore and how, what did she, how did she respond to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Oh, yes, and again whether this is all out of and it doesn\u2019t matter. I mean this is how memory works. This is why you can ask nine different people what happened at the scene of an accident and you going to get nine different explanations. But at some point something well you know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">you\u2019re asking me. You\u2019re asking me to choose to go someplace where I can\u2019t go or you\u2019re leaving. And I didn\u2019t all I said were those words and that was her interpretation of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Did you take any of that kind of guilt-inducing statement into yourself because that\u2019s not actually what I\u2019m hearing that you said. That may be what she heard. You\u2019re stating your own needs and she\u2019s received it, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: You know, I think that was the really amazing part in all of this. All I can feel is anger; I\u2019m not feeling the guilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Good, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yes, I get that you\u2019re hurting and I know what that would\u2019ve done to me in the past and I\u2019m not backing down. And I know that there\u2019s going to be the onslaught. I mean this is a fucking fireswamp. I mean this is just going to be, this is just going to be and I get it. This is karma; this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">the path that you set up a long time ago. Intentionally, unintentionally it doesn\u2019t make any difference. It\u2019s all the damn dominoes that you\u2019ve set up. You can\u2019t talk about your feelings; you can\u2019t do this. It\u2019s 27 years of this so here\u2019s what happens. Here\u2019s what happens after 27 years of setting up <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A12\">those dominoes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, okay but this is a two-person issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Oh I know but I\u2019m going to take responsibility for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Sure, but you\u2019re not yes and my guess is there were times in the marriage you did try to talk about your feelings and you were shut down and maybe her as well. That\u2019s usually what happens. Somebody teaches you how receptive they are to what you think and feel but you\u2019re not able to do that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">anymore and you\u2019re not asking anything unreasonable at all. Physical and emotional intimacy, that\u2019s one of the reasons why people get married and have romantic relationships in the first place, those two things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">So this isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s unreasonable. It\u2019s a game changer, right, because you\u2019re married kind of in name only, and she\u2019s okay with that because she\u2019s getting her emotional needs met elsewhere but you\u2019re not okay with it any more. I mean I\u2019m very proud of you even though I recognize that it\u2019s a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">deeply painful experience. But it almost needed to happen because you\u2019re not good at not being honest with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not good at being honest with me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not good at not being honest with you. You can do it but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yes, but it\u2019s taken its toll. Yes, and what you\u2019re asking the compliment that\u2019s missed is I want to be close to you. That\u2019s not what she heard but in some ways -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t yes, you know what? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Well I, and I hear what you\u2019re saying but the idea that I want intimacy and this is your expectation I don\u2019t know if you guys can do that or have that given all of the damage that\u2019s been done. I don\u2019t know that you can\u2019t have it but I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">from her but stating that expectation there\u2019s still an inherent compliment and it is this is what I\u2019ve been looking for; this is what I need. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes, and if anything the only thing that I can hold onto right now is that I can say that to me. I can say that to me and it\u2019s okay. Another event that happened is, in sharing some of this with a friend, there was this image that came back to me in some work that I have done a long time ago <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">in terms of like the inner child kind of thing. And this is back when I was doing my Masters in Religious Education. I did a pro-golf journaling class. So you\u2019re doing this imagery stuff and you\u2019re going back and revisiting past hurts and that kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">But this image this friend had talked about this dream where she rescued this child from this real seedy hotel. She knew that there was this child in there someplace and that she went in and rescued this child. And that seemed like a really powerful image with me. I just kind of sat with that for a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">while and I kind of envisioned the seedy hotel and I\u2019m walking down this hallway. And at the end of the hallway I opened the door and I\u2019m in the front yard of my childhood home. And I find myself, the five-year-old self who\u2019s kind of hiding in the bushes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">And I remember this scene but it was this hiding from a couple of neighborhood boys who were laughing at me at the time, and I don\u2019t even remember why but that was what was going on. And I had had this vision or have worked with this image before and it was always like you would go and talk to the child <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">and tell the child it was okay, whatever it was, blah, blah, blah. And this time it was no talking. It was just like I grabbed up this five-year-old image of myself and it\u2019s been a hugely powerful thing because he hasn\u2019t left me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Tell me what the image means to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: The image is just this deep sense of giving myself some love, just like cradling those parts of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I can see that it\u2019s painful for you. Can you tell me what you\u2019re feeling right now as you\u2019re telling me about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: That sense of all those years of not being able to do that. All those years of this little child who\u2019s just been alone and hurt or whatever. Whatever that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Having to hide, even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yes, and can\u2019t speak and interestingly enough there\u2019s a mask. I\u2019m wearing The Lone Ranger mask and a little cowboy hat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: The five-year-old?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yes, this five-year-old and I got rid of all that stuff. You don\u2019t need to have this on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: So you saved you, comforted you, hugged you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yes. So I do meditation in the morning and I got this meditation bench. So the posture that I have is you\u2019re kneeling on the floor on this bench and this little five-year-old is just right from me and it\u2019s just, it\u2019s a really powerful imagery right now so that\u2019s really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like, and pardon my interpretation if it\u2019s not correct, but it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m kind of walking with you through this image but I imagine for the first time in being honest about your feelings not only do you validate them but you comforted yourself. So in some ways you provided <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">the intimacy that you needed because you believe that your feelings are true, honest and valid. And before you had been dismissing them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yes. And I really do feel like there\u2019s a sense of commitment to that, there\u2019s a sense of power to that, there\u2019s a sense of I know there\u2019s been no way that I can go back to whatever that was. So that\u2019s been a powerful game changer for me. Sitting in on Matt Englar-Carlson\u2019s workshop <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: How did that go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: It was good. The thing that I brought out of that was working with men is working with that deep sense of shame. And some pieces started to fall together there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Tell me about the pieces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: My issue of having this mild deformity in my penis or my penis is this huge shame that has been the major definitive kind of thing that\u2019s going on in my life and recognizing the power of that shame. My God. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s almost like you\u2019ve been multiply shamed in multiple areas. So the penis is the symbol of manhood; that for you is a source of shame. Men, I was just having this conversation with my husband and this is what makes me crazy about our society, how we tell boys don\u2019t feel, man up, be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">a man, which I think are the most destructive messages you can give another human. Don\u2019t feel and if you feel you\u2019re weak or vulnerable. And on so many levels you\u2019ve been told don\u2019t be. Don\u2019t be, don\u2019t be you, don\u2019t feel. And in some ways that\u2019s not even who you are. And so undoing all those damaging <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD2\">messages takes a long time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yes, so I\u2019m really trying to be patient with myself because, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Well damn, I mean you\u2019ve some amazing work in a short amount of time. It\u2019s painful work but for -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019m not running away from it, I\u2019m not backing down from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: No you\u2019re not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: I get it, this is really hugely watershed stuff and it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: It can either be painful ending or a new beginning or both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yes. It is already both and I just don\u2019t know what that new beginning is. But whatever was ended a long time ago and it\u2019s just a recognition that that was over. Now, whatever comes out of that I don\u2019t know. At this point today, I\u2019m still lashed to the mast and I\u2019m screaming. There ain\u2019t no love <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">and there ain\u2019t no compassion. And until that tempest dies down, there\u2019s going to be no reasoning with this right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s it go ahead, sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: No, I was just going to say, yes it was yesterday because we had the snow yesterday, that I was in this place. And she was home from school, I was trying to get some work done and then it was so we had this conversation talking about trying to go down that road of talking about intimacy and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">recognizing that we are talking two complete different languages. And I recognized in just sitting there just trying to not get into counselor mode but really just trying to deeply listen to what she was saying I feel and hear that she is so completely petrified of moving down the road of <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Physical intimacy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yes. That there\u2019s just and she\u2019s just screaming against that and yelling at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yelling at you physically?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Oh yes. I can\u2019t go there. And what if I had some other kind of thing like if I was in a car accident and I was a quadriplegic and would you stop loving me then too? And I get, you know, I get that this is a very real thing for her. And she says fine if intimacy is, if that\u2019s so important to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">you then just go find somebody and have yourself a good lay and then so she\u2019s just yelling <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: And then? And then what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yes, I don\u2019t know. And be happy or something. She can\u2019t understand. She can\u2019t hear what I\u2019m saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Sure because she\u2019s coming from her own place of fear. But again it\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s not hearing what you\u2019re saying because for her it\u2019s about you\u2019re going to ask me to do something I don\u2019t want to do. And what? It\u2019s certainly not unreasonable that married people have sex regardless <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD1\">of whatever age across the lifespan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: You would think though it would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yes, but it\u2019s most married couples have sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Well not according to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: Well but research shows differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Her research, however -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yes, but she\u2019s not able to hear the emotional intimate piece. Physical intimacy is an outgrowth of the emotional intimacy typically in a marriage, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: What was it like for you to kind of say these things to her and then get yelled at or not be heard? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: You know, I think again it was just pouring more gasoline on the fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yes, I almost hear that your needs were diminished. Like, if you just want sex you go out and find it\u2019s not just sex and sex is actually pretty important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: She can\u2019t hear that. She\u2019s never been able to hear that and I get that now. I get that probably all the way back to the beginning of our relationship but that\u2019s not the way the relationship started. Which is so completely confusing because she was the one that initiated everything in the beginning <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201131\">and I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Sexually? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yes, and so that was so all the sudden we got this completely upside down relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: How do you think that having sort of the physical deformity and her cutting off sex seven years ago -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Oh that was huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yes, how do you think those things kind of have impacted you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Well it confirmed my worst fears that I wasn\u2019t loveable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: Even though that\u2019s not true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Oh of course. And even though that wasn\u2019t what she was saying. All of that aside, deep down inside the story that I was really listening to was that and that happened prior to seven years ago. That happened -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Sure. Are you familiar with narrative therapy at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve changed your narrative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: Oh I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2012A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re in an alternate story here. You changed the dominant narrative. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Well tell me what you\u2019re hearing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yes. Well the dominant narrative is what we\u2019ve been looking at this whole time, all these messages of inadequacy, these messages about your worth and keeping your feelings. But you as of last week or two weeks ago now just changed the narrative completely. Like I don\u2019t want that any more. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201311\">We have been talking about the old scripts and how they weren\u2019t true and how you\u2019re this kind of really talented man who can pick up and do all three careers and do them well and how you\u2019re sort of a very deeply feeling man even though that has been told, you have been told that\u2019s not okay. And you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201312\">got rid of that negative narrative. It\u2019s brought you to a painful place but a very honest place and a place where so I\u2019m hearing her kind of saying these things and diminishing your needs, but I\u2019m also hearing that you did not take that in and say you know you\u2019re right, maybe I should but you would <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201313\">have. That\u2019s how we know that the narrative has changed. You would have gone okay, you\u2019re right; maybe I shouldn\u2019t want sex, which is insane. It\u2019s insane. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s insane and that\u2019s what I did for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Well the insane part is if your expectations were unreasonable. But they\u2019re not unreasonable; they\u2019re normal healthy expectations for a marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: Yes, I can see if my only expression of sex was sadomasochism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: Sure, exactly. Exactly. And I mean yes, it\u2019s her own terror and things like this. I get that and have a lot of experience working with individuals of sexual abuse. I get that. But the fact that it\u2019s a surprise that you need these things is troubling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not a surprise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: No, she\u2019s surprised that you are saying you need these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Maybe not I mean this has always been an issue and she\u2019s always, it\u2019s always been this kind of thing like you can\u2019t just love me for who I am; you got to have sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: Okay. Can you take me back then before the kind of seven-year absence period, past the beginning part of the relationship. You had three kids; you\u2019ve had to have sex to have three kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: All three times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yes, at least three times. But so how was this what was being conveyed in your marriage let\u2019s say 15 years ago sexually about sex?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Same story. Same story. I\u2019m not sure at what point the honeymoon ended; it didn\u2019t last long. And when I\u2019m sure after the kids. It\u2019s kind of like this sense of okay I got three kids; we\u2019re done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: So sex was always an issue? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yes, I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know it\u2019s difficult to go back but it\u2019s been a very long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: And always the message was you always want sex, you always want sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Can\u2019t you just love me for who I am?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: Wow. That\u2019s a pretty loaded message. You know what it says? You\u2019re not supposed to want this from me. What\u2019s wrong with you that you want me to have sex? You\u2019re depraved or whatever, which is completely not the case. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s the but that was the relationship and just over time, over time it eventually got to the place where we couldn\u2019t have sex at home any more. So sex was relegated to maybe three or four times a year by going away for the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20152-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20152-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">THERAPIST: And then was it awkward or was it always initiated by you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">CLIENT: Oh it was pretty much always initiated by me. And we had gotten to the point that the only way you were going to have sex is if you had two or three drinks beforehand. So you had to get in this self-medicated state before you could go there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: And how was sex after the medicated state?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: Perfunctory probably. Not satisfying. Whatever. Yes, you just kind of recognize that this is, this is just ugly, ugly to pull all of this garbage out. But yes, I think I got to that point that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Well no wonder you stopped having sex. If you get told that something\u2019s wrong with you basically or why can\u2019t you just love me for who I am, pretty soon you\u2019re like it\u2019s not worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Well I think, yes, I think between that and for at least 10 years she\u2019s had these pre-menopausal migraines. So I mean if it\u2019s not a headache, or working or the kids or whatever, A, there\u2019s no time and it\u2019s like wow, there\u2019s just no time, there\u2019s no time. And then <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: You know what I wonder? Sorry to interrupt you. It\u2019s almost like, and obviously I don\u2019t know your wife, but it\u2019s almost like you know what the real fear might be about for her? Finding out there\u2019s something wrong with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: Oh yes, I know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yes, right, and so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Because there\u2019s nothing wrong with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yes. Well so instead I say there\u2019s something wrong with you, there\u2019s something wrong with your expectation, but deep down I wonder because I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s pretty common knowledge or maybe because I teach the human sexuality class but most married couples have sex around once a <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201691\">week. Younger married couples have sex more; middle-aged couples usually have sex about one time a week. This is not anything that\u2019s unexpected, out of the norm. It\u2019s really not. And so I wonder if the fear is you\u2019re asking me to give you something I can\u2019t give you, I\u2019m not capable of. What\u2019s wrong <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201692\">with me? So it\u2019s just a lot easier to say what\u2019s wrong with you that you even want this? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">Well of course you would. I mean it\u2019s a healthy need, absolutely normal, nothing wrong with it. It\u2019s the expectation that you would be having sex with your wife. But this of course sex is the smallest piece of this. This is not about sex. Sex is just a way to communicate emotional intimacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">CLIENT: Right, and this, and the conversation always gets derailed around this. We end up talking about this and it\u2019s like okay, we\u2019re missing the point. Missing the point completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">THERAPIST: And if you could tell her right now what the point is in a sentence, what would be your point? What would you want her to know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: That you got some serious hurts and you\u2019re going to need to get them fixed. And there\u2019s no hope for intimacy until you can fix that. And, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: How would you define intimacy to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: Intimacy is the ability to be completely vulnerable to another person. And right now I know that I can\u2019t go there. I\u2019ve never been able to go there with her because there\u2019s been such a huge part of her that\u2019s been walled off. And I recognize that I can\u2019t bring my vulnerability to that because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201751\">it\u2019s like okay well I\u2019m going to be completely open and vulnerable with you but you don\u2019t have to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20174-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20174-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561980\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20177\">THERAPIST: But in some ways you did by putting your feelings out there and by being honest even through anger, right? So you go from a place of not expressing your feelings to expressing your true feelings, whatever they are, in some ways you did. I mean that\u2019s the amazing part about this. I\u2019m not throwing <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201771\">that word around because I like it. I mean it\u2019s amazing what you did after years of feeling stuck and silenced and not being able to do this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">You were dead honest, unflinchingly, about how you feel and what you want despite the fact that you\u2019ve been told for so long that that\u2019s not okay. Some part of you doesn\u2019t believe that and you put it out there making yourself vulnerable. And then refusing to take in any guilt about it or refusing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201791\">take in and this was not unkind. This is just really honest refusing to kind of continue in this place of being stuck. You\u2019re certainly not stuck any more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">CLIENT: No. No, and it\u2019s like screw it. I\u2019m getting, I\u2019m putting intimacy in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Well what do you think about this idea being thrown in your face of just go find someone if that\u2019s important to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F\">CLIENT: You know what? To a certain degree I feel like I made this commitment to myself whatever a week ago, two weeks ago, and I said you know what I already have friends. I already have friends. I have friends that care about me and I think recognize some things about me. Who the hell says I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F1\">have relationships, friendships? I can just explore that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20181\">THERAPIST: She meant sexually, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20183\">CLIENT: I know she did and I\u2019m not ready to go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">THERAPIST: No and I\u2019m not suggesting or encouraging you to do that. But I\u2019m saying what do you think about her throwing that at you? What did you do with that piece? [0:46:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">CLIENT: It made me feel really cheap. It made me feel really angry, like God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I was concerned about. It was designed, that comment was designed to minimize your sexual needs and make you feel cheap but it shouldn\u2019t. [0:46:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t accept it. I mean I felt that and at the time I was in this place of listening to it but I wasn\u2019t in a place of reacting. I quickly went to this place of you know what, I can sit here and listen and I can just be in the moment and listen and that\u2019s about all I can handle. And I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B1\">like not that I\u2019m tamping down my emotion but I feel like at that point I was just giving her the gift and allowing her to get it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure. So where does all of this leave you? It\u2019s a lot. [0:47:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">CLIENT: \u201cWell this morning, and I recognize that for I don\u2019t know how many years I showed up faithfully to Wednesday night choir practice and she goes out with the girls every Wednesday night. I know that. I go home after choir practice, I go home and whatever, watch whatever series I\u2019m watching on <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F1\">Netflix or whatever. So last night it was screw this. I\u2019m not going to go home any more. I\u2019m tired of sitting in front of the goddammed television and wasting my life. So I just asked one of the guys I don\u2019t want to go to a bar but how about Starbucks? You want to go to grab a Starbucks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">THERAPIST: Sure.

You know, right on kind of stuff. And one of the things, there was a little five-minute segment, when you get to the TED (ph) talk there <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019B1\">was a little five minute segment where she\u2019s talking with Oprah. You know it was just a little segment of six people you shouldn\u2019t share your vulnerability with, people who don\u2019t deserve your vulnerability. And I recognized in the midst of this last night going out with this guy it\u2019s like yeah, we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019B2\">not going there.

I came home after choir practice and you weren\u2019t here and I just, I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A71\">just start to feel it bubbling up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">THERAPIST: It?

I wake up very slowly in the morning and I have a half an hour to 45 minute meditation routine, exercise, and I have to go walk the dog and \u2013 I move. I get up <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF1\">very early in the morning because that\u2019s my time. And she got up this morning at 5:30 and she\u2019s out there making breakfast and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Pissed. [0:50:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B3\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m getting up and I went out and I walked the dog and normally we walk for five minutes. But I just walked and I was so in touch with one other episode where I was that angry and I ended up walking down the country road for about three miles and I wasn\u2019t coming back. It was just like \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201B31\">I\u2019m just \u2013 and I\u2019m still [0:51:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B5\">THERAPIST: And do you know why you\u2019re so pissed? I mean, I think I get it but do you know why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B7\">CLIENT: This is just all too little too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Yes, well it\u2019s faux intimacy. It\u2019s like putting a band-aid over a gunshot wound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BB\">CLIENT: Exactly. So then \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re going to make me breakfast now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BF\">CLIENT: And she\u2019s saying those words to me. So what I feel is I\u2019m putting all this intimacy out here and you\u2019re just pushing me away. And I said I can\u2019t just turn it on like a spigot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure. And it\u2019s still another representation of the fact that she doesn\u2019t even get what you\u2019re asking. [0:51:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C3\">CLIENT: She doesn\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Like if I just come home from choir practice and make you breakfast then we\u2019ll be okay and we can go back to what we were. But you aren\u2019t going back; that\u2019s not possible. And it\u2019s not about breakfast, right? Maybe a decade ago it might have been about breakfast and talking over breakfast <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C51\">but we\u2019re far beyond that point. It\u2019s \u2013in some ways I would imagine it minimizes what you feel.

I don\u2019t think you need to worry about hurting other people but you might think of other people, even people who you might not have known long, maybe even students in the program who you have a connection with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E3\">CLIENT: You know, I do have a connection with some people and I do feel like I\u2019ve got people. I\u2019ve got a network of people here; thank God I\u2019ve got a network of people here. And a little bit here, a little bit there \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Use your network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E7\">CLIENT: Yes.

You can share a piece with this person and a piece with and that\u2019s one of the things I typically find with students in that program. With students who support other students they\u2019re typically really <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E91\">good at doing that but you are processing this so you\u2019re in the middle of it. Like I said I am really proud of you even though I know that this is a really painful place. But I also know, I mean I want you to think about how much this took out of you. I mean I want you, I guess I want you to know how <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E92\">brave you are. This is an act of bravery because if we went back to, and we can because they\u2019re all on tape, earlier sessions even my mentioning the idea of your anger you said I can\u2019t go there. Even the idea of thinking about talking to your wife brought up all this anxiety and you just busted through <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E93\">that in such a short amount of time.

So if you say can you <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201F11\">give me a call I\u2019ll say yes, what time do you have, I\u2019ll definitely give you a call. That\u2019s never a problem.
