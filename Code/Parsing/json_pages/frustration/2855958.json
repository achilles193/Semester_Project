I just got out of the hospital, anyway!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh, you did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: We don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we will.

Boy, did I let out a scream! (therapist affirms) So the following day...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I heard you from here!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yes! I... got up, and slid right down to the floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Oh, no!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Right up against...

Deborah called 911, because she couldn\u2019t get me up, and I couldn\u2019t get up. So, the ambulance people came, the fire engines, you know, the whole works. (pause) They asked what was wrong, and Deborah said, \u201cShe fell out of bed.\u201d Right? (inaudible) down. So, one of the... EMT guys said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">they... my face looked like it was drooping, and that I looked like I was having a stroke. So, they wouldn\u2019t take me to the Amherst Hospital; they took me to the hospital in Cheshire, where I went to the Emergency Room first. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Oh, no. What, did they try to get... what, IVs in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: IVs into me, which they couldn\u2019t, but that, yet they kept sticking away, figuring they were going to get... So they figured, you know, they finally got it, until, you know, the blood was just squirting right back out. I was saying, you know, \u201cIt\u2019s not working!\u201d \u201cOh, but that\u2019s fine.\u201d So I took <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">it out myself and said, \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s bleeding!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: (under breath) Oh, no...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a no-no here in the hospital.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, guess what? If you had gotten it in in the first fucking place, I wouldn\u2019t have taken it out!\u201d I said, \u201cI know what the hell I\u2019m doing!\u201d So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019ve probably applied (ph) more than they have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, well, we\u2019re going to have the IV nurse come in. The IV nurse came in and, you know, she\u2019d go, \u201cWell, let\u2019s try another one.\u201d She couldn\u2019t get it. After five times, she still couldn\u2019t get it. I says, \u201cIs there anybody else? The janitor? You know, the housekeeper? Maybe they know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">the hell they\u2019re doing, because you people certainly don\u2019t!\u201d Next thing I know, I\u2019m up in a room on the second floor! They admitted me! For a urinary tract infection, I had E coli in my bloodstream, and I had pneumonia. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: You had pneumonia? Oh, my gosh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: So, I got admitted into...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: This was what, this was the day... Wow! When was this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: The Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Just two days after we met last.

Then I get up to the second floor, and the secretary up there recognized me, because I trained her to be a secretary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: And the Pediatric Department now it\u2019s all separate, private rooms; so that\u2019s where they had me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: In the Pediatric?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, there are no more Pedi (ph), though. So what they did was they made all of those rooms private ones. (therapist affirms) Well, this floor, the second floor is humongous. They took out all the offices on the other side, and they made all rooms out of there. So, I don\u2019t know how many rooms, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">but there are quite a few. There is this one fucking doctor, 47 years old, he is. He has every patient on that fucking second floor. He comes in the room... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s in charge of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Every single patient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Oh, my God!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Right? Well, he comes in my room, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not Mr. and it\u2019s not Dr. I like to be called Ivan (later corrected as Evan).\u201d I says, \u201cYeah? It\u2019s not Mrs., it\u2019s not Miss, it\u2019s not Miss Sawyer (ph), it\u2019s not Ashley, it\u2019s Louise.

I said, \u201cGood, we won\u2019t have any conversations, will we?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: (pause) What... what the heck was that about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What a guy! Well, he\u2019s... he must...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Oh (chuckles), you don\u2019t know how many times I clashed with him the whole time I was there! I went up to the front desk and he\u2019s standing there. I says,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">\u201cYou discharging me now?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">\u201cNo.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">I said, \u201cWhat do you mean, no?\u201d I says, \u201cThat, since I\u2019m not having a stroke,\u201d I says, \u201cI want to go home!\u201d I said, \u201cI want to go to my own hospital, Amherst Hospital.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll call up the ambulance and have them come and get me, and switch over to, Amherst Hospital.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">\u201cNo, I\u2019m not discharging you!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">I says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to discharge me!\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t have to be here if I don\u2019t want to be here!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">\u201cYou\u2019re too sick!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">(pause) This is his fucking excuse. I was lucky if I saw a nurse. The only time a nurse came in was to change the IV bag, and to change the antibiotic, and to give me a shot of Heparin (which my whole stomach is so black and blue and purple, it\u2019s unreal).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: From the shot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. You would think I only had one side of a stomach, because that\u2019s all they stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Oh, boy!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: (pause) Finally, it got to the point on... what was it? The following Tuesday... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the Heparin for, again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Because you\u2019re not moving, and they don\u2019t want clots to form...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Oh, right, yeah. It\u2019s an anti-coagulant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: ...so they give you the Heparin shot, yeah. So they said, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not on any blood thinners?\u201d I says, \u201cYou have my fucking list of meds. No, I\u2019m not on any blood thinners.\u201d They decreased... some of my medication. If I was taking... 10 mg, they would give me 2.5 mg. So with this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B1\">lovely UTI, I had no control of my bladder, so the moment I got up to head into the bathroom, I would pee the whole way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Oh, boy!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: So then I\u2019d have to get changed, and of course, the nurse\u2019s aide, she just really loved that. I says, \u201cWell, don\u2019t look at me! This is, it\u2019s your doctor\u2019s God-damn fault. You know, Eeeeevan!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855958\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">(pause) (whispering) They did not like me at all up there for some strange reason! They did bring me up my breakfast, and I refused to eat it. So the girl finally came up, she says, \u201cWhat can I get you, Louise, because you have to eat.\u201d I says, \u201cAll I want is a bowl of Cheerios every morning,\u201d I says, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">\u201cand a piece of, and a fresh fruit cup.\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t see how they can go wrong with that. I don\u2019t want tea, I don\u2019t want coffee. Give me apple juice, give me orange juice. That\u2019s that.\u201d So they did that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">Then finally, she got it correct on lunch. I had chicken salad sandwich, fresh fruit cup, diet Pepsi, and diet ginger ale, diet Coke. Same thing, I had it for lunch and for supper, the whole four days I was there. It\u2019s the only thing that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: You were there four days? (client affirms) Oh, my gosh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, until I finally called Dr. Winchester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And you were, this was just to recover from the pneumonia?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the UTI, and the E coli in the blood system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: So, I finally called Dr. Winchester\u2019s office. I explained everything to his nurse, Daneen (sp), and she Dr. Winchester call up Dr. Evan and I was discharged immediately! (pause) Good boy, Dr. Benny!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Benny boy came through?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes! Dr. Evan was in the room and he says, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ll be leaving us, because I just heard from a Dr. Winchester, and he wants you discharged.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: That\u2019s from the good old hospital. (sound of paper rustling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Carlos Ivan? (client affirms) (corrects) Evan. Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Look him up on... on Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s his nationality?

Asshole!\u201d I says, \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what I said, too!\u201d (chuckles) I says, \u201cHe kept telling me, \u2018It\u2019s not going to hurt!\u2019 And then he kept saying, \u2018I\u2019m using a little needle.\u2019 It\u2019s a needle looks like this!\u201d (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Why was the skin off? Was it...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">CLIENT: It\u2019s... it\u2019s just not healing, since when I fractured it a year ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">THERAPIST: It just still hasn\u2019t healed, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: And, of course, all of the falls I take. I don\u2019t land on my knees or over on my stomach or on my side; I land straight on my ass. My two legs are out straight... it\u2019s my ass that\u2019s taking the impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: That, and when you hit your coccyx, that is terrible. It is really, really painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah! So now I have this DuoDERM thing on it that\u2019s supposed to be like another piece of skin. She\u2019s got that on it. If it falls off, I have spare ones at home that I can put on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">THERAPIST: And what do you do, just tape it on the back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">CLIENT: No, it just sticks. (therapist affirms) It\u2019s like silly putty, almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s called DuoDERM.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: And it does stick pretty well? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. So... we got that on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Okay. Gosh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">CLIENT: Then I go back and see Dr. Winchester next week, if everything is fine this week. I still have to go back next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll go back on Tuesday, as usual?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2018A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855958\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: So he can check me out.

Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: (pause) Um, yeah, so... What\u2019s with the UTIs? Did they tell you what it was from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve had it since April! (pause) Since April!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Nope, no. I mean, I\u2019ve been with Mark, but you know, there is nothing there for me to have a UTI. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: No, okay. Not from intercourse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: No. (pause) Can\u2019t blame Mark for that one. But I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like I said, I\u2019ve had it since April! Dr. Winchester gave me medication, he gave it to me for two days. After two days, it... it was back! Then the next doctor gave it to me for three days, then the doctor after that gave it to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201991\">me for seven days. I\u2019ve been on antibiotics the whole time, and I still had a UTI! (pause) So... Now, I\u2019m still back on the antibiotic. I think I have two more days, a few more days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: To take it? (client affirms) But you\u2019ve been taking it since April, on and off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: Since April! Almost the whole time!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Almost the whole time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah! And, of course, the more you take antibiotics... the more you wind up having to take another antibiotic, so... And then, as I said, I had two different types hanging, one for the UTI and one for the E coli. I don\u2019t know what the hell they were giving me for the pneumonia. They certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A11\">weren\u2019t giving me breathing treatments, even though I was wheezing like a son of a bitch. Oh, I had oxygen on. How easily we forget! Now that we\u2019ve gotten a year older! (pause) So my lovely granddaughter will be here for the whole summer!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">THERAPIST: She is coming for the whole summer. You had told me last time what had happened, that she had gotten admitted, right? To the hospital for overnight? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Peer pressure is what it was, from school. She\u2019s now living with her other grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Oh, she is!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yup. She loves it. She has a queen-sized bed, her own room, you know, everything. Her Uncle Bobby drives her to school every day, her Uncle Bobby either picks her up, or her Grandpa Joe or Nana Margie picks her up from school. Today was her last day of school for the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Same school. (client affirms) Well, you know, what do you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">CLIENT: She had finals. Well, she\u2019s been, as I said, she\u2019s been with the grandmother. Her phone was taken away from her, so she\u2019s had no contact with any of her so-called friends. She did talk to my Riley and she told Riley that a lot of it was peer pressure, and the other kids, you know... saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD1\">\u201cCome on! Come on! Stop being a pussy! Come on, have a smoke! Have a smoke!\u201d And she\u2019s not a drinker. She doesn\u2019t like booze, just like Deborah. Deborah doesn\u2019t like booze either. But she did like her marijuana, and she, you know, did try a head of acid... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: She did, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: ...which is, you know, Deborah has, Deborah\u2019s done coke. You know, you name it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: You name it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: That must scare you a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (therapist sighs) So the two of them (noise like crinkling cellophane), that, you know, fun city. So Deborah\u2019s totally been, they\u2019ve been talking on the phone for about an hour at a time, which is very unusual for Deidre. She\u2019s generally the \u201cyes, no,\u201d you know? (therapist affirms) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B91\">But now she\u2019s been, you know, talking to her mother quite a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855958\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: How has that been for you to see?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s good for me, you know, I mean when I think it\u2019s fine that they\u2019re talking. Deborah says, you know... she\u2019s going to straighten her out when she comes here. I says, \u201cWell, no matter what, when she comes here...\u201d Are you involved, can you take her on a tour of Cambridge? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Can I take her on a tour of Cambridge?

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: I wouldn\u2019t be able to get her in anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: All right. Because she wants to see Cambridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Oh, she should go, she shouldn\u2019t go to... They have like a, Visitor Information Center right in the center. (client affirms) Right in the center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: All right.

(pause) I guess her work, according to Riley, Riley and I talked yesterday for about an hour. (pause) Riley said, \u201cHer work has kind of slipped,\u201d she says, \u201cbut not as bad as she\u2019s expected.\u201d So, I says, \u201cWell, that\u2019s, she went from an A to a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD1\">B?\u201d And she says, \u201cYeah.\u201d I says, \u201cWell... we\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d But she\u2019s in all advanced classes anyway.

The kid was like 16, doing advanced classes; 15, doing advanced classes; 14, doing advanced classes.

The other stuff...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: Heath works all night long, so he sleeps all day long. Then Riley works days, so she\u2019s not home either. So, it made it easy for Darla to just drop, drift off into her room. (therapist affirms) You know, she\u2019d make herself macaroni and cheese, and take the whole pan and bring it into her room <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D91\">to eat it, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and she... but, yeah, what you were describing to me, too, was this, I think last week, is that she\u2019s been really withdrawn (client affirms), something is really happening for her emotionally (client affirms), she\u2019s going through a real... change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: Riley says she wants her mother. This is what she wants: her mother. She wants to know why her mother left her, and all this stuff, you know? She did find out where Heath hides his stash of pot, so Heath must still smoke, and Riley doesn\u2019t know it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) Oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: Because Riley\u2019s not into that.

Papa Joe cooks her whatever she wants, Darla gets cooked for supper. If Papa Joe don\u2019t cook it, Nana Margie cooks it, and since Nana Margie is home all the time... Darla has to, you know... she has 24-hour watch <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E91\">on her. (chuckles) Which is good! And she likes it! She wants to stay there. I guess she finally went and got all of the rest of her clothes from her father\u2019s house, and she wants to stay at Nana Margie\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, huh. Something about being at that house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED\">CLIENT: There is more discipline at Nana Margie\u2019s house for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah! Okay! Well, maybe she needs a little more TLC, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. She gets that there, too. Oh, Papa Joe will get her anything she wants!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you know, I think, you know, the way you described Heath and Riley; you know, they\u2019re busy, they have two kids who have a lot of their own needs. Of course, Darla is Heath\u2019s kid and Riley is taking ownership in a lot of ways about that, but... I guess what I hear is, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F31\">she misses a mother. She misses an, you know, having somebody who puts her first, who really cares about her. You know like, you how you\u2019re describing being one of 47 rooms. Well, you know just how it feels! (client affirms) I think Darla is speaking from that place, too. I don\u2019t want to be, I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F32\">to be somebody\u2019s special girl. (client affirms) She\u2019s really hurting over it. (client affirms) I mean not to say that\u2019s the whole story, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s like what, they have the... Okay, there are four kids all together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s right. There is a fourth kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s Heath and Riley\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">THERAPIST: Yes. Oh, then the two are Riley\u2019s kids. That\u2019s right, not Heath\u2019s, yeah. Mindy and what is it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">CLIENT: Evelyn. So, it\u2019s like, you know, okay fine. But... with Nana Margie and Papa Joe want to buy her her school pictures, she gets them, where if she\u2019s at Riley\u2019s, she can\u2019t get them because they can\u2019t afford to get all four school pictures of the kids. I says, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t, they don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD1\">to take the best package! They can take, you know, a small package and you know, do it that way.\u201d (therapist affirms) You know? I mean, because that\u2019s what Heath used to do to begin with, instead of sending me the good pictures, he would... (pause) not fax... Yeah, he\u2019d fax me over a picture. Or, um... <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD2\">(inaudible) faxed copies... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Photo... scan it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">CLIENT: Scan.

So I said, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re getting your senior school pictures done?\u201d I says, \u201cI will pay for the package, Darla.\u201d I said, \u201cI want the biggest package they have.\u201d I said, \u201cI want one of those, you know, size there, the 8x10s, 11x12s,\u201d I says, \u201cI want the small ones, the big <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202051\">ones, the wallet ones.\u201d I said, \u201cKey chains!
