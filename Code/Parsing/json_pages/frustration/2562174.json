[Is something wrong?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I totally failed to get out the door this morning. I was awake at 7:00, but I picked up a book and started reading and then didn\u2019t actually get out of bed until ten \u2018til 8:00, which is entirely too late to start getting ready if I want to be here on time. Then I don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">get up and get dressed. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m wondering if, although I think you\u2019ve (inaudible at 00:00:58) this, but it also kind of sucks first thing in the morning \u2013 I mean any time \u2013 but especially compared to lying in bed when you\u2019re tired and reading something you want to read.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I think you often talk about things that you\u2019re pretty upset about and that make you feel pretty helpless and bad. You also sort of focus on or pay attention to feeling them in a way that I think you often don\u2019t know how to describe, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re looking at them as directly, if <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Right.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure there are many other things, but I guess I was imagining that\u2019s some of what can make it hard to get out of bed for this. I know it can be hard to get out of bed, in general, (inaudible at [0:02:43] and I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t other factors, but those are factors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: There actually was something that I wanted to explicitly dissect in here. I ordered paper for my book.  I think I said I had paper that I ordered last fall. I never looked at it and I discovered it was the wrong stock; so I ordered paper and I was very careful both on the phone and in my online <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">order to say I want the text-weight paper. (laughs) And they sent me127 pounds of cover stock. What I had done was I had ordered 80-pound text, but there is both a metric and an imperial system for specifying paper weight, so 80-pound text is 118 grams per square meter. They sent me the 118-pound cover <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">stock. You can see how that might have happened in their fulfillment department. That was stressful and I wasn\u2019t able to print over the weekend. I was very stressed and upset about that, but I called them and I said, \u201cYou sent me the wrong paper. Give me a shipping label so I can send it back to you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">You need to send me the right paper.\u201d  They were very responsive about saying, \u201cWe will ship your paper. The paper has shipped already.\u201d I would have it in time to print this weekend. They said they didn\u2019t want the cover stock back because what the hell are they going to do with 128 pounds of cover <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B4\">stock cut to A4? No one buys A4 except, apparently, me. They actually sell paper in parent-sized sheets. Parent is 24\u201d x 36\u201d or sometimes 26\u201d x 34\u201d; sometimes 27\u201d x 29\u201d or some large size. Then you can ask to have it cut to whatever size you specify, which doesn\u2019t have to be a standard size. You can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B5\">make whatever cuts you want.  They were like we can\u2019t sell this; just keep it. Then I felt remarkably guilty, like I had somehow cheated them or was stealing from them or like I owed them money now for this cover stock. I didn\u2019t want it and didn\u2019t order it and it was entirely their fault that I ended <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B6\">up with it. But I still feel guilty about it, like I\u2019m somehow getting away with something that I shouldn\u2019t be. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562174\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What comes to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s really weird. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: I guess I have two thoughts. The first one is I wonder if there is something about being treated well and, in a way, kind of generously, not so much with letting you keep the cover stock because I don\u2019t have the impression it\u2019s of much use \u2013 and you\u2019ve probably had enough of it already \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">but more that they acknowledge their fault; they seem to have apologized; they shipped the other stuff out right away; they didn\u2019t make you go through the hassle of trying to send the cover stock back. They said so clearly \u201cthis is on us; we\u2019ll do the best we can to remedy it.\u201d And did. That makes you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">feel guilty and uncomfortable.  Maybe that\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to go. The second thought is I wonder if that\u2019s also something that makes it hard to get out of bed and come here. If I\u2019m nice and I listen or I am (inaudible at 00:08:39) what\u2019s going on with you and you feel guilty and it\u2019s hard to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">endure 45 minutes of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Sometimes it is hard to endure 45 minutes. I don\u2019t know; maybe it\u2019s the guilt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Like if you come in late, then you kind of beat yourself up a little and you\u2019ve lost some of your time and so it\u2019s a little easier to just (inaudible at 00:09:14) or something. That\u2019s what I have in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Okay. (long pause)  It\u2019s also I\u2019m kind of extra sleepy right now because yesterday was my birthday. Dave and I went out and stayed out late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible at 00:12:48) making you extra sleepy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: We went to this new-ish restaurant in Lexington called Sarma. It\u2019s owned by the same person who owns Oleana and Sophra. Sarma is mostly small plates and craft cocktails. I had too much to drink last night. (inaudible at 00:13:38)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:40).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Sarma has a lot of the same flavor, but much more casual; and, of course, small plates.  (long pause) My parents insisted that I give them a list of things that I wanted for my birthday; and they insisted on specific titles or links to places where they could buy things online. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">It\u2019s one thing to ask for suggestions, although I feel like once you\u2019ve known someone for 32 years, you shouldn\u2019t need specific suggestions. It\u2019s one thing to ask for suggestions; it\u2019s another to say \u201cjust give us a link that we can click on and put in our credit card number. It\u2019s very annoying. I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">gave them the names of books that friends of mine had published, especially ones that I thought, if my parents knew or understood anything about anything or even managed to read the back of the book cover blurb, they would disapprove.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Do you think it\u2019s the effect of being tired or something else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I was thinking about the book and there is one author who has not signed her contract yet and sent it back with edits to the contract, saying that she wants to be paid twice \u2013 once for the paper edition and once for the e-book edition \u2013 and I don\u2019t know to deal with that. First, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I don\u2019t understand what she means by the change she made to the contract. If I\u2019m interpreting that correctly, I don\u2019t understand why she thinks she should get paid twice when none of the other authors are getting paid twice. I kind of feel like I can\u2019t ask my lawyer \u201cwhat the hell does this mean?\u201d because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">I didn\u2019t use the contract template he drew up for me. I went and grabbed one off the Internet, largely because I kind of avoided and couldn\u2019t deal with calling and telling him I didn\u2019t like his contract template and could he please redraft it; and it got to the point where I had to get contracts out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">to the authors or the book wasn\u2019t going to happen and I hadn\u2019t dealt with my lawyer\u2019s contract draft.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562174\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Right. I think I remember that. Your problem with his draft, if I remember correctly, was that . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: I had lots of problems with it. It was too aggressive. The language style was really formal, even for legal contracts. I had sent him sample contracts that I have signed with magazines that have published my work and said, \u201cI want something that looks like this in form and style,\u201d and he just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">ignored that.  And there were a lot of mechanical things to it that I felt were confusing and unnecessary, like \u201cauthor will return a clean and legitimate manuscript within 60 days of signing this contract and this will be done within blah-blah-blah days and blah-blah-blah\u201d when really the way this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">particular niche of the publishing market works, is you accept works as-is. You might do a couple of line edits, but you don\u2019t send out a contract until the thing is edited to the point where you are happy with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s silly to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: A lot of excess confusing language, like a page-and-a-half of legalese over getting drafts in. It\u2019s completely unnecessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Right. I would imagine the people sending you stuff aren\u2019t people who hire lawyers, necessarily, to read contracts and all that, so they just want something that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I need to e-mail this author so I can ask her \u201cwhat do you mean by this clause?\u201d (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess some of this stuff with the lawyer reminded me a little of what you were wondering about with the paper company. You were, I think, feeling guilty, insisting on the kind of contract that you wanted and then kind of getting back something different from the one you drew up and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">kind of stuff. (pause) But I guess it seemed to me it was a situation where you kind of feel in the wrong, even though you probably know you\u2019re not.  (long pause) We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
