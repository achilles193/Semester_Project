What did you hear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT 1: He said... it's how he said it. He was like, what do you think the problem is?

We shouldn't be in therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT 2: I said that because you and me should be able to talk, we should be able to talk, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT 1: Okay, and we're not able to talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT 2: Well, we used to be able, we used to be able to talk to each other all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT 2: You remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT 1: Not about important stuff.

(Pause) All right, never mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: So were you...? This isn't... because... yeah, there's a lot of... there's something going on here about what you feel you guys are saying to each other. Did you say...?

[0:03:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, I'm just... I'm frustrated that we haven't made any improvement at all since we started going here.

Huh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT 2: That's the way I feel, at least. I mean, we've tried things, but we haven't gotten anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT 1: Because you haven't tried.

Clearly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT 2: Yeah. So we can't get over it. It's... it would have happened by now, and it hasn't., so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT 1: What would've?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT 2: If we could have gotten over this whole either disagreement or whatever it is, we can't get past this point. Otherwise we'd be able to fix things. We can't. Otherwise we would've already fixed a lot of things. Do you not agree with me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT 1: No, I don't agree with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT 2: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Because I feel like you have to put effort into fixing things, not just it happening.

[0:04:56] But I will say I've heard from both of you feeling like things have gotten better. I'm not saying that everything's great, but I've definitely heard that from both of you. So something has shifted this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">morning or today or over the week that's making you feel differently, which is fine. I want to talk about how you're feeling. But it does feel different. Especially you guys came in here last week, said... both of you said things feel a lot better. So something got lost. What do you think happened? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT 2: I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT 1: This whole week we haven't spent any time with each other.

Like, she's blowing... she's making it out to be a bigger issue than it really was. If anything ever happened this morning... she said she had a hard time getting me out of bed. She went downstairs, she said we have to be going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">to the therapist. I said, yeah, I know, because I was already awake.

[0:09:57] (Chuckling) I'm just frustrated, that's all.

No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT 2: No, no, that doesn't have anything to do with it. It's just I always get from her... she points out negative things that I do. [0:10:56] And it just bothers me that she doesn't try to talk or work with me. She'll just state the obvious all the time and then restate the obvious a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD1\">way. And then she'll ask a stupid question. She'll say, do you see how... do you see what you're doing? Do you...? Why are you...? You know?

She's going in circles, and I don't, I don't' know how else to explain it.

I wish I could give you an example, but I don't even know where to start. [0:16:57] (Pause) Rather than her just saying it, she has to go about making it really difficult for no reason. I don't... it happens all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F1\">time, though. I say that a lot, don't I? (Sniffing, clearing throat) (Pause) Do you think I'm just saying that to say it?

I'm like, well, I'm interested <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201211\">in who your friends are, and you're like, didn't you...? I already had this conversation with you. I told you all about him.

She'll drill me with questions like, how old are they? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">What do they look like? Are they a boy, or are they a girl?

You haven't done it with the Portland one yet. But you've done it with the other two stores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, and I gave the... and I haven't done that with...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT 2: The Portland store, you haven't, right, I know.

Who do you work with? Are they your age? Do you know anything about them? What have you talked to about them with? Just questions you just wouldn't ask <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201431\">a person one after the next after the next after the next.

I'm not... I don't want to be hard on you, and I know you're feeling like... I don't want either of you to feel like you're under attack or on the defensive. But, if Marlene's doing something differently that she should have done <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201751\">it before, there's not much she can do about before. But she can do something about now.

And when I asked you about it you were like, I recognize that Marlene's trying. This reminds me of the first session you guys came in when you were just, like, both crying the whole time. And I feel like I'm attending <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201831\">a funeral, it's like something really... and I... people's emotions are real, so when people are really upset I believe there's something to be upset about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">CLIENT 2: (Sniffing) Yeah. [0:23:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">THERAPIST: And so there's something that's deeply upsetting you guys.

(Pause) Not that this has anything to do with what we're talking about, but now that we have a day off we both have stuff to do. One way that I can temporarily put everything off to the side is if I get some alone time by myself. I know Marlene doesn't like when I do that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201891\">because she wants to be with me. But... and it's been a problem in the past, like, a big problem.

I hope you realize that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT 1: Steve, you go to work for 2:30 PM. Like, you have time in the day to do stuff. [0:25:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT 2: 2:30 PM? What are you talking about? The one day that I close?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT 1: You only (ph) work in the... no. You go to work in the afternoon, or you get out at 3:00, or you have shorter shifts than I do. You have a lot more time than you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT 2: I'm not trying to compare jobs. It sounds like that's the direction you're going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT 1: But I feel like you're able to work, and you're able to do you. But you're not able to do us or help out at the house. You can do work, and you can do you. That's not fair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">CLIENT 2: (Sniffing) That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT 1: But that's how it is. Like, I have all the responsibilities, and I don't have any choice. Like, I don't get to spend any time with you at all (crying). And that's a problem. [0:26:55] And then you want your free time. How is that a relationship? It's almost, like, not worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT 2: You can see how this is a problem (sniffing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and it's a problem in part because I think you're talking about two different things there (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, we are talking about two different things. I was trying to talk about time that I can use to put my stress and feelings to the side. And all of a sudden we're talking about something different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT 1: How is that something different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like... right, because where Steve was going with this, it sounded like you... that you felt Steve was saying, look, I need... like, somehow that you were excluded. Like, he needs time for himself but not for the two of you, that somehow you're being excluded from something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">CLIENT 1: But he takes the time for himself all the time. (Crying) And he hasn't spent any time on the relationship, so I don't get it. I really don't get it. [0:28:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT 2: I could understand if things were a little different. Like, if, say, I did go out and do stuff when I wasn't at work and then we [came back] (ph) to work on our relationship, I could understand that's what you're talking about. But I don't even go out and do anything, Marlene, I go to work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B11\">and I come home. That's it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559542\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT 1: That's... that's not my problem, that's not my fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT 2: I don't hang out with friends, I don't do... I'm not saying it, I'm not saying it is. I didn't say it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT 1: Like, I really feel the problem is you don't know how to manage your time, and you're selfish. Like, it's all about you and how you can have time to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT 2: Marlene, I'm trying to tell you how I can help us work on things. You need to let me have a little bit of time by myself. [0:28:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT 1: You have time by yourself all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">THERAPIST: What...? Let me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">CLIENT 2: Never mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">THERAPIST: No, no, no, no, no...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">CLIENT 2: I can't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">THERAPIST: I will... I'm going to help you guys. Let's not... I don't want to do the never mind. I mind, and I want to help you guys talk about this more. So what do you... when you say time by yourself, what time are you... would you life more of or differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">CLIENT 2: (Chuckling) It's not something I can specify like, I like 3:30s in the afternoon. That's not what I'm saying. Just it comes to my day off... I mean, yeah, I'm not trying to make a big deal about it, but I don't feel I am... I still feel like I'm living at my mother's house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">THERAPIST: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">CLIENT 2: I don't feel like I have the freedom to be able to do anything. It sucks, it's my only day off (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT 1: It's like you can't do both, Steve. You can't work, have free time to yourself, and be in a relationship. [0:30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Well, then I want to stop and ask each of you what you mean on (inaudible at 0:30:05). So how... are there particular things that Marlene does that makes you feel like you don't ... is it what she says or what she does that makes you feel you don't have that freedom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT 2: She just (sighing)... I don't know. I just don't get the feeling that she'll let me do whatever I want, you know what I mean? I just... I don't... I just feel so tied down (crying, sniffing). I don't know how else to explain it. I can't point anything out, you know, this is the reason. I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D11\">feel super tied down. I don't feel like it's my... I don't feel like it's my day off. [0:30:58] (Pause) It's a horrible feeling because I only get one day off. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">CLIENT 1: I think that's how we're going to differ throughout this relationship.

You're talking about a feeling. And when you're talking about feelings, you're talking about the feeling, it might be tied to things that are going on in the day... [0:31:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">CLIENT 1: I... what my problem is... and I can just tell you straight off the bat, you do not take time to have a relationship with me (crying). So you're talking about time to yourself, which annoys me because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT 2: I know it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">CLIENT 1: We're by... we're not with each other ever.

And I was just saying hi, that's it, like he does when he's at work, and I don't... if you don't answer me, it's not a big deal. I'm just texting you. And yes, in the past I have been like that, and I am sorry. But I am actually trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB1\">be a different person in this relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">CLIENT 2: How am I supposed to know that, Marlene?

I'll talk to you about it later if you're really that curious. You don't need to call me back 35 times (sniffing). Like, do you see the level that you take this to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021F\">CLIENT 1: Maybe because we don't have time together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20221\">CLIENT 2: But that doesn't mean you need to bring it through my... through the cell phone (chuckling).

That point never happens. It... she just told me... I just told her how I felt about the phone, and then she just brought <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202291\">it to total opposite, said, fine, I'll never call you again.

She'll just give me that response immediately. (Pause) And it just... it just makes me <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202311\">feel like... I don't know. It's just basically like a whatever answer, you know what I mean? [0:37:55] And she used to say all the time, too. Thank God she stopped saying that. (Sighing) I mean, it just... I don't know.

And you, Marlene, feel like Steve isn't making the effort (chuckling) to meet your expectations about <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202371\">the relationship and what you want from him in a lot of different ways. So you're pushing against each other very strongly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">CLIENT 2: All the time, all of the time. Even when we're relaxed, even while we're relaxed. Like, lying down next to each other in bed, we still have the same feelings. [0:38:58] They never get... I don't know. Yeah, (inaudible at 0:39:03) that's exactly what's going on. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Okay, a couple thoughts. Where to start (chuckling)? Do you feel that you each understand what the other person is saying? I don't... you don't have to agree with it, but like that, Steve, Marlene's saying that she feels rejected and excluded...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">THERAPIST: She wants you to come... let's say you have to agree with it.

Can you see that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">THERAPIST: I understand, but I think you both do that. I mean, I do think you both do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">CLIENT 2: I do that because of what's happened in the past. I just know... because every time I think that, it happens. It's just the way it's going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">THERAPIST: One thing... I don't want to move away from what you're talking about, but one thing I'm struck... I mean, you... when I made comments today, you were like, well, it's always like this. You both said that. But I've seen you guys in here, and it's not always like this every session. It seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202551\">like sometimes you guys are doing a lot better than other times, like, dramatically different. Last week was a dramatically different session. So I'm not sure what happens that things really feel like they fall apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">CLIENT 1: He doesn't continue. He does the nice things, and then he stops. He tries in the relationship, then he stops. [0:42:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">THERAPIST: And you feel like he was trying before but not this past week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">CLIENT 1: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">THERAPIST: And what did he do differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">CLIENT 1: He did everything. He tried to help out with the house, he tried to be around more. He just was active in this relationship, and this week he just wants to go out and fish and doesn't help me with the house (sniffing), isn't affectionate, isn't there. Like, how do you shut off in one week <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F1\">(crying)? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">CLIENT 2: [I don't think I've been doing] (ph) anything different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">THERAPIST: Well, if you were different this week, say you were very different, it sounds like you feel like you go to the worst-case scenario. [0:42:58] Like, maybe it's an off week, but last week was great. So hopefully next week will be great. I'm not saying you should think that way, but that's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202631\">what comes to your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">CLIENT 1: Actually hearing all this (pause) I don't really feel very positive about this relationship (inaudible at 0:43:21) (crying). I feel like I put in everything, and I don't get anything in return. And that's why I'm always up your butt. Like, I 'm just... I just try, and I feel like I'm doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202651\">everything. And it's like I'm in a relationship by myself. You're not present at all. And that's why I am so critical because my needs are not met in this relationship. [0:43:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">THERAPIST: Each of you when you're feeling very hurt feels like the other person is doing something to you that's negative. I think you're both doing things because you don't know what else to do, and you're feeling like, I'm going to do the one thing I know how to do. But you each interpret the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202671\">person's behavior as you're trying to... the other person's trying to hurt you or make things difficult and so forth. I don't think that's what you're doing with each other. As you were saying, Marlene, you don't know what else to do. What you do might antagonize Steve, or he may feel antagonized by <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202672\">it. But that's not your intent. You do not know what else to do. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20266-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20266-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559542\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20269\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026B\">THERAPIST: And you're reading pretty negative emotion... negative motivations that make it very difficult to start anywhere. [0:44:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026D\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, after somebody just tells you they want to be left alone, how do you...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026F\">THERAPIST: But he's not trying to tell you because he doesn't like you or he... he may be frustrated with you, but I think that this... I mean, what... see, I... well, it's interesting because you started going somewhere with that, Steve, in terms of a way in which you manage how you feel. Now, again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2026F1\">I'm not saying therefore he should be left alone. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying it's in a different context than it feels to you. And this is both ways, it's in a different context. It's not... you're interpreting each other's being against you. What Marlene isn't trying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20271\">CLIENT 2: Oh, all... with everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20273\">THERAPIST: Marlene isn't trying to go against you. She's trying to get you to come toward her, and she doesn't know how to do it. And so you feel like she's riding you, and I'm not saying whether she is or isn't. But she doesn't know what else to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20275\">CLIENT 2: No, I totally understand that 110%, and I wouldn't feel like she was riding me for any reason if she hadn't called me that many times just... she's been on my back for a long time. [0:46:05] And yes, she's tried to let that go about certain things for a certain amount of time. But it just <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202751\">hasn't worked, and it just keeps coming back, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20277\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like she hasn't asked you anything about Portland so far. So she needs some credit for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20279\">CLIENT 2: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B\">THERAPIST: You guys have got to get... Steve may not... may feel ambivalent about being here, but he comes every week. And maybe Marlene's had a quote, unquote, bad track record in the past, whatever that means, but she's trying. And she's making a very concerted effort to do things differently. I can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B1\">stress enough that ultimately it's up to you guys to decide what you want to do with this relationship. It's not me to tell you what to do at these... this is your choice, and it's your life. But I can... I would like to help you sort of see that you're doing... you are... you actually each are trying. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B2\">Showing up is trying. It may not be enough, it may not feel like enough, it may not be enough. But it's something. [0:46:59] And, if you guys are just going to sort of go back and say, see, you see, you see, you see, it doesn't get you anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D\">CLIENT 1: But, if it's trying and then you know that that person's going to give you attitude about coming every day they have to come, it's just uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027F\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like that that happens every week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20281\">CLIENT 1: Yes. And then he throws, this is my only day off in my face. Well, I'm so sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20283\">CLIENT 2: It's not your... I never said one...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20285\">CLIENT 1: But you punish me because you have this huge attitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20287\">CLIENT 2: How do I punish you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20289\">CLIENT 1: You have this attitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028B\">THERAPIST: Well, I actually both... we're going to need to stop. I know this is a really tough place. But you've both... I... if you could carry with you, I mean, really hold on to the fact that neither of you are trying to hurt each other... Marlene isn't trying to hurt you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2028A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559542\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028D\">CLIENT 2: No, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028F\">THERAPIST: Steve isn't trying... Steve is really not trying to hurt you. He does not know what else to do right now, that you're doing what you know how to do, which isn't working. [0:47:59] But that's what you're doing because you don't know what else to do right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20291\">CLIENT 2: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20293\">THERAPIST: And I really would... if you guys could hold on to that, I think that would be great because I think even that will make you feel a little bit calmer, not entirely. But the other thing I want to say... I mean, you guys are clearly both very, very stressed out. And I think that that's making <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202931\">things very hard, too. And, I mean, you have a lot of other feelings besides stress, but you're both really stressed out. And I'd like to talk to you guys about that, too, how you feel and also just practically, maybe what the two of you can do about that. We do need to stop. I could do this... if this <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202932\">time works for you, I have 11:15. Would that work for you? You said that morning is better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20295\">CLIENT 2: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20297\">THERAPIST: Is this a good time?
