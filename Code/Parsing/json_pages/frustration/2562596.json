It\u2019s like no\u2026[pause.]. Had such a hard time getting up this morning. It\u2019s been like really sleepy and fatigued. I don\u2019t know. Not because of any physical exertion. Just like, I think mental. And not even\u2026I\u2019m not even working. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">just kind of like scared. I just want to sleep the whole time. I had hopes to work yesterday, like in the evening, but just like couldn\u2019t\u2026just like all these people make demands on my time and I feel like so burdened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Like I sent like\u2026this is funny, weird, but on Monday, like I just spent the whole time planning; planning my next month because I have a big deadline and yeah. [Pause.] And I sent\u2026my mom an e-mail saying, \u201cI have a big deadline, so I\u2019m not going to be able to be there for you guys as much. I will ignore <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">the following things, and I made a list. And I put down lunch, lunch with mom. It was funny to send, you know, your mom an e-mail that is like, oh you know, maybe that\u2019s what planning looks like. [Laughs.]. I don\u2019t think it got through to her because yesterday she called me for lunch and I was in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">meeting with my boss at school and I called her back and like, \u201cI\u2019m at school.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, then maybe dinner?\u201d So she\u2019s like, and then she brought the dinner over, which is nice. I guess I shouldn\u2019t complain about it, but it\u2019s like it takes away time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">And then my friend from school called and like she can chat for hours and we chatted for over an hour and finally I had to say, \u201cOkay, I have to get back to work. I\u2019m failing this other class.\u201d I just cannot like say no to people or like make time for myself. I don\u2019t know; maybe I can. I\u2019m just like\u2026[inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">\u2013 09:40]. Just feeling burdened like all the things that need to get done and like responsibilities. Sure enough, she\u2019s going to call today as well. Let\u2019s have lunch. I\u2019m so annoyed by it. [Laughs.] [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">Sometimes I do feel like I\u2019m too nice. You know like I just do want to rebel and say I\u2019m not doing anything. I mean for others. Like one time a couple of weeks ago, my sorors roommate was like let\u2019s make a big dinner. I wasn\u2019t able to say no. So, they kept making plans for it asking me what should I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">get, what should I get? And it was mostly his friends. And then I told soror, who was like, \u201cOh, why are you doing this? Just say no. Just say you can\u2019t do 10 people. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d But I just couldn\u2019t. So. Yeah, so I just like got there and he brought all the stuff and he was like, \u201cOh teach me.\u201d I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">like I can\u2019t do everything, you know. So I just told him to step aside and then I cooked like four or five different things. And everyone loved the food and all, but like I was just like [Laughs.] I felt great that, yeah, I accomplished something. People love my food. They\u2019re all so appreciative. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">then I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know. Why do I do that? Why would I do that? I don\u2019t know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I do sometimes just want to like sometimes not go to class, and I am I am like\u2026I missed three classes. And I\u2019m not going to go today, so I\u2019m missing\u2026I\u2019ve missed four classes. And that teacher is like, she e-mailed me and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d And then I realized the syllabus says if you miss three classes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">you fail the course. And she\u2019s like I\u2019m not going to fail you, but your grade is going to be affected. So I\u2019m like I guess so. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562596\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">I do feel like striking and not doing anything for anyone. I guess maybe why do I think I\u2019m doing things for them? I could think all the things I\u2019m doing for me, like, you know, going to class is for me. It\u2019s not for the teacher. I could think that way. Maybe that would make me take more ownership of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">it and feel less burdened about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: How do you do that, though? How does, when it\u2019s changing perspective completely, but how does it work? Like my mom calls me right now about lunch. How is it not a burden? How do I think it\u2019s really about it? How is it like for my benefit? You know, it\u2019s like her expectation instead of, \u201cHey, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">would you like free lunch?\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound a nice little lunch. It sounds like medicine or a sentence; an obligation. As it does to class, as it does I do a lot of things. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing a bad job planning. I don\u2019t know. Maybe that was it. I was like if I feel like, oh, like there\u2019s so much work to be done. It shouldn\u2019t feel like that because I should be able to plan. So why does it seem like a burden, you know. I don\u2019t understand that. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">And I feel like that\u2019s the answer even to like questions from last week. That oh, you know, I\u2019m all frazzled because of hopping from place to place. Perhaps, you know, maybe instead of paying attention to the thing at hand, I\u2019m thinking, oh, where am I going to go [inaudible \u2013 19:18]. Maybe. But think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">like if I think about things as they\u2019re my choice or I\u2019m doing all these things for me, then maybe, you know, I wouldn\u2019t seem as frazzled. It wouldn\u2019t matter, like where I go. Maybe it\u2019s just wishful thinking, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">I feel like earlier, like things have worked, even if I spend the night elsewhere rather than at my own place. Like the next morning, I\u2019m just like I\u2019m in a\u2026yeah, I just want to go to my place and like work. Yeah, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">It\u2019s just like so I\u2019m feeling motivated and driven or not. I think. If I feel that way then things don\u2019t obviously get to me and they don\u2019t seem like such a burden. I\u2019m like, yeah. And I don\u2019t feel frazzled as much. So\u2026[Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Where are you right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Where are you right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019m talking.

[Laughs.] No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: You seem distracted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m not like thinking about this thread and how to connect everything through it. So. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you feel everyone wants a piece of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well I wish that would make me feel flattered. [Laughs.] [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: It would only make you feel flattered if you felt they were interested in you vs. what they need from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] Yeah, I don\u2019t understand. What is the\u2026I mean it sounds like a subtle difference. But what is the difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, the first is valuing you, for you and who you are vs. what you can do for them.

So I feel like bad, I guess. But with my friend, I was like, I really didn\u2019t want to talk, but I felt obligated to talk, you know, even though she did seem interested and like, yeah, you\u2019re a good writer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">Yeah, you look good in that skirt, you know. Yeah, you should do this or you should do that. And she said all of these things to me, like it wasn\u2019t like she just kept talking about herself. But it was just like you know, like I was working on my homework and she called and I shouldn\u2019t have spoken to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">her right then, but I couldn\u2019t not pick her phone. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Why couldn\u2019t you not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know like. So she\u2019d call like Friday night or like text and I just walked in to a bar with my friends so I couldn\u2019t talk to her then. And then I called her over the weekend, and she wasn\u2019t there. We just kept missing each other, but I felt like I should talk with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">Yeah, I just feel like obligated instead of like it\u2019s mutual and I get something out of it or it\u2019s nice to talk to friends, you know. I used to think, oh I don\u2019t ever talk to anyone on the phone and you know, maybe the conversation lasts five minutes and it\u2019s all about logistics. And here I have someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">to talk to for hours that\u2019s really\u2026and then I\u2019m still like why do I have to do this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: But you feel like you don\u2019t have a choice. Like you feel like if you want to pick up, because she\u2019s been trying to reach you. You don\u2019t feel like you can say I would love to talk, but now is not a good time. Maybe we can find a time over the next week. You don\u2019t feel you can do that. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">then you feel like somehow she\u2019s put you in this position that you can\u2019t say no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, it feels that way. But I don\u2019t know how to get out of that. I don\u2019t know how to say those words. Hey, I can\u2019t talk right now. I mean I feel like I have said them. I mean I guess it\u2019s easier to text those words than to say them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: What is it about saying them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I never felt it. It doesn\u2019t feel right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What does it feel like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: You know. Like mean or something selfish. Self-important, which I sometimes don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s earned because I feel, I don\u2019t know, bloated or fat or like stupid or subordinate. You know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">Yeah, I guess when I feel kind of low and slipping through the snow with [inaudible \u2013 27:32], you know, it\u2019s you know, without choice and burdened. But then when I feel kind of okay and I feel kind of good, and not fat or not bloated or like not\u2026I feel active instead of passive. I am able to say those <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">words. I have said them. At least to my mom I\u2019ve said them, you know, like yeah. I\u2019m really busy. I don\u2019t think I can come and have lunch with you. You know. I say those words. Or I say, you know, you come over. I do say them. And I do not pick up sometimes when I\u2019m going somewhere on Monday and my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">friend is calling me and I was talking to him on the phone. I don\u2019t take her call. I don\u2019t call her back because it was my time and I said after, and protected, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">But other times it\u2019s like I\u2019m like a door mat. I just cannot pick myself up off the ground. It feels like having to launch a rocket and there is not enough fuel. I just wish that it would be or that inertia would be just physical instead of mental because the mental inertia is just so like damaging <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">and debilitating or it can be, you know. And it just lasts for days, maybe, you know. Definitely hours and hours. I don\u2019t like that. I\u2019m like a totally different person then.

Why are you like scribbling on the paper? Talk to me. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">like \u2013 I did reply to him \u2013 I said, I did talk.

But.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I think there are times you\u2019re disengaged that you may not realize that that\u2019s what you\u2019re conveying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">I had to see the doctor yesterday and I went and I had to wait 30 minutes and I got so mad. I was about to leave and then she called me in. She\u2019s like what\u2019s up, what\u2019s wrong? And I just had to say I was feeling like a low sugar. So she went and got me a Power Bar. [Laughs.] And it\u2019s like what am I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">like\u2026I can\u2019t convey this to everyone. How am I going to get a job? How am I going to keep that job? How am I going to\u2026if I\u2019m teaching in the future, how are people going to\u2026how are students going to react if I just kind of slip in to like low energy mode, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well that case it sounded like you were really getting annoyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: In that case, yesterday, you were annoyed with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was very pissed. I went and asked the receptionist, how much longer is it going to be? And she just kind of, you know, looked away and I got so mad. I was like, okay, yeah; ignore me. And she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m looking at the chart.\u201d And then she came out and she was like, \u201cI was looking at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">the chart.\u201d And I\u2019m like well you made no show of, you denied [inaudible \u2013 32:16] like you even heard me. That had like a little fire in [inaudible \u2013 32:24]. Sorry. I don\u2019t know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">My friend has \u2013 I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bringing this up \u2013 but she has MS, and I feel like she and I bring each other down at times. Because she has this attitude like, I\u2019m going to die and you know like I\u2019m going to be in a wheelchair and I\u2019m going to not do this and not do that. It\u2019s pathetic. So most <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">of the time I\u2019m like encouraging her, like her saying all that brings out my more active side. But sometimes you think it\u2019s like that maybe the volume needs to be turned down. Which is why I\u2019m like attracted to follow because he\u2019s like active and he\u2019s like\u2026he brings out that side and like, you know; <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">he\u2019s like say yes, you know. Just say yes. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s hard to be engaged when you feel at times you don\u2019t want to be somewhere or you have to be somewhere because you\u2019re obligated to be; you don\u2019t want to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. You can\u2019t change. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">I realize it\u2019s like\u2026I feel physically and mentally very different at different times. I know you\u2019re going to think it sounds so silly. But like it\u2019s like [inaudible \u2013 35:41]. And you know, it was a cold day, right, and I wasn\u2019t out for much, but just you know, from the station and that you know, school. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">But I was physically bored. I don\u2019t think I worked out yesterday. But certain other days, like when I go running, I feel kind of much taller, you know. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s because you know, I spend more time Chris yesterday and he\u2019s kind of tall; much taller than me. [inaudible \u2013 36:24] is kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200952\">short. It\u2019s silly, but maybe it does have an effect. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562596\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">Yeah, just like it\u2019s all around me. Like I feel short and I feel disengaged and unproductive. And then other days it\u2019s just like I spring up and often feel tall and get stuff done. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">Yeah, it\u2019s just weird that tall spaces can have that effect. Like maybe I shouldn\u2019t think about it too much; it may be too damaging. Like I\u2019m at my own place. There is no reference. You know it\u2019s like I am me and I don\u2019t feel short or tall; I just feel\u2026I might feel tall, you know. I like own the space. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">It\u2019s a tiny little\u2026but I feel like I own that much space. I can own it. But then I own this place. It\u2019s like, yeah, you know. Like it definitely feels like [inaudible \u2013 39:20] dwarfs. It\u2019s not just his height. Like he has like high ceilings. But you know it\u2019s like I don\u2019t feel as accomplished there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B2\">And then a taller space, I do feel accomplished because I do all the cooking. Yeah. Different. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">It\u2019s weird. Like yesterday he came back and he said I want to apologize for the summer. And I\u2019m like, why? I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: What was he referring to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Just what happened with that woman and her father. I guess he was talking to a friend and it came up because he was like, the same circle and that friend knows this woman. So, I guess, the friend was asking Chris or talked to Bryce and Chris was just saying I don\u2019t want to see her and then Chris <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">told him what happened and I guess the friend was talking more like or saying something like wrong; it wasn\u2019t right or something. And he came and apologized that he didn\u2019t respond to the e-mail because she accused me and stuff. I\u2019m like as you know, you\u2019re kind and you didn\u2019t do\u2026I don\u2019t expect you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A12\">do anything different, you know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">Just weird. Appearance like, yeah I look. So it\u2019s not that bad. You know like I started seeing other men because of this and I left your circle and found a new circle. So I\u2019m doing okay. I used that as an excuse to be promiscuous or whatever. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">Are we out of time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: No. You brought up on Monday something we haven\u2019t really talked about very much to this point, maternity leave and the logistics of maybe how you feel about it. You might want to make sure we can talk about it today and continue to talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Sure, yeah. When is the leave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So, assuming all goes as planned, I\u2019ll be here through the third week of June, which is I think June 16th is that Monday. I think that\u2019s so\u2026through that week. And then I\u2019ll be out. And what I hope to do is come in a day or so a week starting at the end of July so that I would at least be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">able to see you once a week. But I will e-mail you probably mid-July just to let you know how things are going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">And then the second week in August, I\u2019m away that week. And then the third week I plan on coming back more like a regular schedule. So I\u2019ll certainly be able to see you a couple of times before then. And then you\u2019ll come back regularly the\u2026I think it\u2019s the second full or third full week in August. Something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562596\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019ll also have someone covering for me should anything come up. Or if you wanted to see someone in the interim, you could do that too. We could talk about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, I hope there are no crises. [Laughs.] But, yeah. I was actually thinking we could do once a week in May, just because I feel kind of, as we talked about, burdened about so many things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a terrible idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah? Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I mean I\u2019m seeing the tongue and cheek, and I mean that. And I\u2019m also aware that my saying you should come in more and then you feeling obligated to do so is itself a dynamic. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I think I have two more weeks of classes and maybe once the classes are over I\u2019ll feel less stressed out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: So tell me about, you know, \u201cI hope there\u2019s not a crisis.\u201d Tell me about that feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was just being funny. But like, yeah, I don\u2019t think so. Like everything is stable. Yeah. What would a crisis look like? I think crisis, in my case, would be something really unexpected. Like what happened last summer. And I don\u2019t anticipate something like that happening because I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">think I\u2019m going anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: But even in that circumstance, you didn\u2019t contact me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: [Laughs.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not being like\u2026I mean a very serious\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I didn\u2019t know right. Like I was in India and I didn\u2019t know\u2026I honestly don\u2019t understand like the dynamics between me and you, like as my therapist. I don\u2019t understand like how much we\u2019re supposed to communicate when we\u2019re not actually in session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: We did have Skype the year before though, so we did communicate\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, because we talked about doing that because those were sessions, right. I don\u2019t know\u2026because I\u2019ve told you like I\u2019m going away for two months. How am I supposed to like\u2026? I don\u2019t know like I could like e-mail you in the middle and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m just, you know. Can we Skype?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m your therapist not only in these sessions, but I\u2019m your therapist. And if you need to contact me, you can contact me. You can always contact me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t know that. [Laughs nervously.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Well maybe I should have made that more explicit. But I am always\u2026I mean. It almost\u2026I feel like, I mean, some of it is just your needing to have, obviously, more information than I\u2019m realizing. I wonder if some of it is connected to what we were talking about on Monday. Like are we connected <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">and like are you just present for these sessions, or is there like a connection that\u2019s ongoing throughout whether we\u2019re in each other\u2019s presence or not? And there is certainly a highly\u2026there\u2019s a highly structured format to our relationship and I appreciate that. So there\u2019s not peace, but there\u2019s sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D52\">of like this ongoing like how you feel connected to me or other people outside. And I\u2019m your therapist in here, outside of here. If you need me, you can reach out to me. We\u2019ll figure out a way to be in contact and for us to talk or meet or whatever. And that\u2019s always true.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562596\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Oh okay. I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It is always true. It is\u2026my maternity leave is definitely, you know, a bit of an anomaly in that sense. You can still\u2026certainly after a week or so I\u2019ll be checking e-mail to again. You can certainly feel free to e-mail me. I will also have someone covering for me who will be more consistently <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">present. But like I said, by, hopefully by mid-July I hope to e-mail you and let you know kind of the deal in terms of, okay, I think I can be back third or fourth week and come in for an hour or so here and there. So that\u2019s what I hope to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: But I like to be available as much as possible. And for some reason, like maternity leave, I can\u2019t be, I\u2019ll have someone else who\u2019s available to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Okay. That would be helpful. Yeah. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: You will not be alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t feel alone as much because I\u2019ve like [inaudible \u2013 47;36] to be more self-reliant. So yeah. I don\u2019t like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: But the question\u2026so that\u2019s true, and that\u2019s good. But the question for you is it\u2019s not simply about sort of over-relying, but it\u2019s about feeling reliant, how people rely on each other in ways that feel burdensome, rather than relying on ways in which you feel sort of like people want\u2026like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">they want to take care of you. They want to take care of each other. They don\u2019t feel obligated to. It doesn\u2019t feel shackled. There\u2019s not simply, in my mind for you, just relying less on people. Like that\u2019s the goal per se. But it\u2019s a different kind of reliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I see that. Like last night I was like after my long phone conversation and multiple\u2026I was ridiculously distracted and trying to work on this poem and like it just wasn\u2019t coming together. And I wrote this e-mail to my professor and I wondered about sending it and I wondered if that sending <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">it meant how I turned\u2026how, in here, you say you turn to me when you don\u2019t, you know, when you\u2019re confused or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">So I thought about whether or not to send it, but I did send it. And then in the morning, she replied and kind of made a small suggestion about the poem and then I was like so totally like\u2026like\u2026yeah, I found that so refreshing. Like she didn\u2019t think it was a burden. She didn\u2019t think I was making excuses. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">She didn\u2019t think I was relying on her too much and I wasn\u2019t self-reliant. But that, you know, as a professor, as a poet, she was able to make a suggestion and that\u2026I found that very\u2026that interaction very rewarding, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Well we do need to stop here.
