Nothing to you. I was thinking about it and was like what about my day, after therapy today? What do I need? I think I\u2019ve really seen that as things are getting busier I kind of have less patience or it seems like I need more help. Sometimes I get frustrated because Jeremy, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">instance, as I was painting stuff for the wedding, spray painting and doing all of this stuff, Jeremy was just sort of playing his guitar. Of course, I didn\u2019t tell him anything to do, but he didn\u2019t offer to help. (scoffs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: What did you want him to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. As my finger was getting sore, help me spray paint.  But then again, my problem is that I have a hard time re-delegating jobs to people because I want it done a particular way; so it\u2019s frustrating. I create frustration for myself because I\u2019m not a very good delegator. For instance, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">my bridesmaids were asking all kinds of things like \u201cwhat do you think of jewelry?\u201d or \u201cwhat do you think about hair?\u201d It was like a little buzzer going off in my head because I just wanted to focus on so many things going on like the starting up of the summer school. So finally I sent out an e-mail <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">\u2013 it took about maybe an hour to construct \u2013 of shoes that would work and hair, getting your hair done is not a mandatory thing; nor is it something that I\u2019m going to pay for.  But if you want, we can arrange to get someone. I\u2019m glad I was able to give direction because I can see that people really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">were working on a grass-roots effort that needed an overriding overseer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">I have this problem where I don\u2019t like telling people what to do. I don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m teaching students; then I sort of see it as different. Even then I have a hard time managing a large group of people. Maybe I\u2019m better one-on-one, but students I don\u2019t mind; I guess because I don\u2019t know them as personally. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\"> But with people I know personally, it\u2019s harder to tell them to do this and do that. I did like that we killed (inaudible at 00:03:11) going to my goals and going to the craft store I was having lots of fun and he was overwhelmed. It might have also been because we were walking around on Saturday and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">it was quite hot, so he might have just been overheated. It was on Sunday. Sometimes I get frustrated when I\u2019m doing things that I like to do, like wear a certain dress or my hair a certain way and Jeremy doesn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t know why. I should be happy because I\u2019m doing something that I like, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">I think for some reason looking for acceptance and consideration from others is . . .  I mean, my bridesmaids are actually being very considerate and sweet and they\u2019re handling so much. Then I see Jeremy, who is not doing anything until I tell him, like \u201coh, we need to do this.\u201d \u201cOh, we need to . . <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">.\u201d and I\u2019m taking him to the paper source and he bemoans it, even though it was really important and he actually helped out because he mentioned about table numbers. He went, \u201cOh, shouldn\u2019t we get these cardboard stands for table numbers?\u201d That\u2019s a great idea. \u201cShould we get thank-you cards?\u201d So he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">really good when he\u2019s thinking, and he has a set thing of tasks to do. He is a better correspondent and sometimes I forget about that. I\u2019m not the best correspondent with the organist and the pastor, so I guess we are . . . I think it\u2019s just getting stressful.  The amount of jobs and the amount of little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200176\">things to think about is proliferating, but he did walk the cats with me and I really appreciated that because it\u2019s hard to take both of them out at once. They\u2019re not like dogs; they don\u2019t follow. They sort of go in their own direction. He is normally very embarrassed to take them out because oh, my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200177\">goodness; what will our neighbors think if they see him walking a cat? When in reality, I just tell him that no one really cares. If anything, they think it\u2019s weird or cute, but it\u2019s not going to reflect upon your existence in this world. For the most part, they may give you a little more space if they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200178\">think you\u2019re weird.  So I think he is helping out. I think there is just a lot. I tried making lists and he has a list. He was taking care of his list for the most part.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735420\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re feeling frustrated and resentful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, (chuckling) for the most part; and I don\u2019t know why. Jeremy definitely gives me a lot of credit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve taken on a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It might have been that maybe I bit off more than I could chew because I think it would be fine. Like for instance, I didn\u2019t get resentful and was actually happy doing crafts on Saturday. But then Jeremy on Sunday was like, \u201cOh, can we actually do something today?\u201d and I got insulted because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">I thought yesterday we walked three miles through Coolidge Corner.  We went in little stores. We walked back and I was doing wedding crafts and you went for a run or went to the gym. I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s not something? If you\u2019re going complain about not doing anything, then there are plenty of things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">for you to do. I think that\u2019s where I got resentful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: What did he mean by \u201cdoing something?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Get out of the house, since Thursday we just sort of ate dinner. I didn\u2019t go to dance. I was going to go to dance, but I was really exhausted. We were going to go to Vermont on Thursday night and Friday, but because of the hurricane we decided to stay home. He just wanted to get out of the house <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">and do something special.  For me, I think taking a three-mile walk down the city was something and we went to our friends\u2019 house on Saturday for a party. I guess he wants something special and it seems to me that I get frustrated because there are times when he nags on me about \u201coh, remember that quilt <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">you were making me?\u201d That\u2019s when I tell him, \u201cYou know, I could stay home and finish that quilt on the weekend and you would just have to do something all alone.\u201d Then he sort of gets quiet, but he keeps on bringing it up, nagging about the quilt. I think maybe that\u2019s why I get resentful, because he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">thinks this is so boring or we\u2019re just homebodies. I\u2019m doing some serious crafts \u2013 serious spray-painting and decorating.  When we did the invitation, it was like pulling a mule to do the invitations because he was so . . . And it takes a while. If you have people that are eager and enthusiastic, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200234\">can get through it pretty quick. That\u2019s why I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m having my bridesmaids come over. Two of them, I know, are quite crafty and one of them is just sort of fun to have around. (laughs) I\u2019m looking forward to having them over. That was another thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735420\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">Jeremy was going to try and plan a meeting, because we want to hear the organist play at a church service and talk to him, at least a few weeks before the wedding, which is coming up soon.  He was like, \u201cOkay, what do you think about this Sunday?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, but we have people coming over.\u201d He <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">was like, \u201cOh, no, no. At the latest, we\u2019ll come home at 12:00 or 12:30.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine.\u201d And then he was like, \u201cMaybe we can meet with the pastor, too.\u201d And I\u2019m thinking what are you not getting? I need this time to finish these crafts. It seems like as I\u2019m getting busy and teaching <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">a summer school, it\u2019s exhausting getting up. I get up at 7:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays and I don\u2019t get home until around 7:00, so it\u2019s a long day. Yesterday I came home and I had spent 40 minutes in a jam-packed \u201cT\u201d, standing the whole time; and Jeremy is all frazzled and stressed and grumpy because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200253\">he was really hungry and he was making dinner, but he asked for help and things aren\u2019t working.  (scoffs) I should be grateful that he was trying to make dinner and getting it initiated, but in the same sense I was thinking I\u2019m exhausted and you had a very easy day. You didn\u2019t get to work until about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200254\">11:30 because you were bike-riding. You left work at 5:00 or 5:30 and it was very slow. That\u2019s not to negate that I did take a 15-minute nap in my office after I ate. (chuckles) But I think, again, last night he got that I was exhausted because I fell asleep by 8:30 and I woke up at 11:30 at night. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200255\"> I just sort of collapsed after dinner. It was very strange of me. I just thought, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just not going to do anything. I\u2019m exhausted and I don\u2019t feel very well.\u201d So I got in bed and I started sleeping, but then I woke up and I couldn\u2019t get back to sleep because I was hungry. Then I just practiced <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200256\">tying bows and did little wedding things and I sort of give myself liberty to try and focus Tuesdays, Thursdays and half of Fridays for research and dance days and Monday\/Wednesday to be just your basic work for the summer school. Once you get home you have liberty to think about wedding stuff.  That <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200257\">way I tell myself that once I start, like today I just ordered something for the wedding and I thought okay, this is good. I\u2019m on the \u201cT\u201d and I have no Internet, so I have to be working on my research. It\u2019s nice because I met with my advisor and he\u2019s actually very excited about my research. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200258\">know if I mentioned this last week, but he sold his boat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you said. (inaudible at 00:13:31) for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: It was nice rereading my draft of the paper because there were a lot of things that, now that I wasn\u2019t so familiar with it, I was like what am I talking about here? So it was nice that I had that separation of a few weeks to just really, as I\u2019m thinking about results now, by Thursday I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">want to finish it.  I\u2019m trying to schedule my life better. But in the same sense, all these little things come up \u2013 even like ordering hair extensions. What hair extensions? I\u2019m looking for the right price. I think I\u2019m tired and it\u2019s starting to get very busy and Jeremy seems to be needy. Even when <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">he feels like masculine and starts to hug me and then suggest that he wants some, I don\u2019t mean to turn him down, but it\u2019s just no, I\u2019m sort of busy. I\u2019m wrapping the flower girl basket maybe.  I think actually, in one sense, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be getting in bed at the same time as him and he actually has <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200293\">helped, I still haven\u2019t been able to fully come during intercourse, but I\u2019m actually getting much, much, much closer. That\u2019s because we\u2019re sort of extending the foreplay, things that get me closer to having an orgasm. So I think in that sense, I feel closer to him and it starts off by hugging and maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200294\">he initiates, but he doesn\u2019t say \u201cgive it to me\u201d or \u201cI want some.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735420\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s understanding more of what actually feels good for you \u2013 good emotionally and physically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Slowly, and that has sort of helped as we have gotten into bed at the same time because then we could cuddle and establish that closeness which, for me, I really like. If I\u2019m already in bed and I\u2019m already feeling kind of sleepy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re kind of not feeling interrupted. If you\u2019re busy working on a project and he approaches you, you\u2019re totally not thinking about that. You\u2019re being interrupted in something you\u2019re already doing and I think the idea of kind of putting things away and getting into bed, you at least take <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">away the interruption factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s exactly it. Like during the day I have a lot of things going on and maybe he doesn\u2019t realize it. I guess because his list is maybe about this big and my list is about this big on top of little things.  That\u2019s one thing. I just don\u2019t vocalize it. I feel like I put up with a lot more, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">but then again, I realize that while I\u2019m putting up with these things, he does do a good job of cleaning out the litterbox and doing the dishes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: Are you forgetting some of the things that are actually on his list?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, I am. I think I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re so much more aware of our own lists and sometimes don\u2019t realize that there are things on other people\u2019s lists that we\u2019re not remembering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: I think maybe we\u2019re both feeling sort of that a lot of things are going on at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it would help to have a conversation where you do share that mental list that you both carry around so he\u2019s more aware of the things that are on yours. My guess is he doesn\u2019t realize, perhaps, the baskets and these crafts that you know and all these do-it-yourself projects that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">you know you want to do or are on the list.  He might not even know they are there in the same way that you drop some of the stuff that maybe he carries around, like the litterbox.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think there are some things that I sort of assume that he just does. I think it would be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: If you can both share with each other the things that you\u2019re thinking about and the things that are on your list, then you can acknowledge it for one another. I think there really is a big disparity. Maybe there are some things that you would feel comfortable delegating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s very true and one thing is I think, too, we have slightly different expectations on how to survive during busy months.  For me, I know that when I was a grad student I was surviving on canned soup and cereal. I\u2019m not to that point now. I still like the cereal, but I\u2019m not to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">point where I\u2019m just surviving, but it is kind of crunch time and I think a good talk over what crunch time means and what seems fair and what are the things that need to be accomplished, both on his list and on my mental list and how we can make this work out. So that\u2019s one thing. The other thing I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">noticed that I was doing last week is that during the teaching session, instead of having our own students, there are three of us teaching assistants in a room with 30 students.  We first have problems that they solve and go around and help them. Then each of us go through each of the problems and show <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200413\">the solution. I have this bad habit of intercepting, because sometimes most of the TFs are first time TFs, so they sometimes do things that are a little unorthodox for beginning physics students. They are all very intelligent theorists and writing tangent of theta as TG theta, they get a little confused <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200414\">and I intercept and say, \u201cOh, Liam \u2013 can you write out tangent for the students?\u201d  Or if someone asks a question . . . I\u2019ve been around these students, so I know the questions that don\u2019t make sense, oddly make sense to me. So when a student asks this and one of the TFs was like \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200415\">or \u201cdo you mean this and this?\u201d They were still confused and Liam, the TF was confused. That\u2019s where I intercepted and explained what the student was trying to think. Then I realized that me, being at the back of the room and the TF being at the front of the room, me correcting him was sort of not looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200416\">good in front of the students for either of us. I don\u2019t know why I was correcting him. I guess for me I sort of felt like I have had more experience. I talked to him and he was like, \u201cThanks for explaining. I didn\u2019t understand what the student was trying to ask.\u201d  I said, \u201cI apologize for intercepting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200417\">In a sense, it\u2019s partially to save the wavering time so that you understand. I tried to make things easier, but instead it just makes it a confusing control of power, like who is in power? Who has the con when they\u2019re speaking?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735420\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: Is the teaching position equally shared among the three of you, or are you considered like the head TF since you have experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: No. The first week and second week, like the first week I actually had to lecture because the professor was gone. Then I was the first one to create problems and I had the ability to change the structure of the sections.  In one sense, if I were the true TF I would probably have more organizational <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">duties; but instead I\u2019m just the one with the most experience. I was a little pushy in the beginning, but the students like the new structure. Even the professor hasn\u2019t worked with these students before very much, and he\u2019s doing a good job. But I think what his idea was for this section is to present <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200452\">three problems and then do a tutorial style. At the time, no one was learning anything, so my suggestion turned out to be very good.  I think I took it that I was the head TF, but in another sense I sort of realized that at the very worst, some of the TFs just aren\u2019t the best at explaining things. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200453\">straightforward, but they can\u2019t break things down to such a beginner level, which for me, I\u2019ve had quite a bit of experience to do. I guess because I can understand their questions. I didn\u2019t do it this time and I decided to be more supportive, like \u201cthese are really good questions that Liam came up <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200454\">with,\u201d because he was the one coming up with questions for this week. They were actually very trick and too advanced, but I tried to put a positive spin on it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735420\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20047\">THERAPIST: Is there a form for you to be able to have these discussions with the other TFs without the presence of the students? Because it sounds like there is actually really important information that you can share with them to help them get on the right page with regard to the level that the students <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200471\">are at and those conversations might not be appropriate to have in the context of the class where the students are witnessing it. But it doesn\u2019t seem fair to let the students be getting problems that are too hard for their level because they\u2019re not going to benefit from that or not be able to get their <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200472\">questions answered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20049\">CLIENT: After each section I talk to the TFs. There is a 45-minute time lag between the sections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good time for you guys to come together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">CLIENT: It is a good time.  It\u2019s kind of silly. Liam, one of the TFs, has most of the layover time with me because there are permutations of six different TFs, but for some reason, I see a lot of Liam. I\u2019ve grouped a lot of times with him. I have a silly little academic crush on him. It\u2019s not a serious <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D1\">crush. It\u2019s not like a true interest, but I do think he\u2019s very cute in a Russian way and I realize that I just have this thing \u2013 I don\u2019t know why it is \u2013 for Eastern Europeans. He\u2019s Ukraine, technically. I don\u2019t know why I have a thing for very smart, Russian Ukrainians. Of course, this is all sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D2\">of in the background. It started as an innocent little attraction for me.  Then I sort of feel guilty. I feel like why do I have this? I\u2019m about to get married and then I start to have this slight sort of \u201che\u2019s really cute and adorable\u201d feeling. I feel kind of guilty. And in the other sense, I sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D3\">of feel like oh, you know. Then I was like well, do I have my dad in me, who acts upon these impulses of x, y and z. Then I just realize it\u2019s fine to enjoy working with someone and thinking that they are cute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You just have to put the appropriate boundaries on it. You\u2019re going to notice other people and meet other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s a good thing to realize.  Just realize that there are certain boundaries. Whenever I\u2019m talking with a guy, in terms of whenever it\u2019s a colleague, I always try to do it in an open space, just because for me that seems like a better way to make sure boundaries are maintained on <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">both sides. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know why. My sister has a thing for Japanese guys and says, \u201cThis singer is really cute.\u201d I get frustrated at Jeremy when he says, \u201cThat girl is cute,\u201d in Walmart even. And then in the car, driving, like, \u201cLook at that girl, hottie,\u201d or something.  I told him I don\u2019t like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200512\">it when he does that. I asked, \u201cHow would you feel if I saw a guy and said, \u2018Look at that cutie. Oh. I wonder if he\u2019s single. He\u2019s hot with the ladies.\u2019\u201d And he said, \u201cWell that\u2019s different.\u201d I said, \u201cHow is it different?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause women are just aesthetically beautiful.\u201d I said, \u201cJeremy. No. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200513\">You know it doesn\u2019t make me feel good, so don\u2019t say it if you don\u2019t want me to feel bad.\u201d He was like, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d And he\u2019ll probably still say it and it\u2019s frustrating because I don\u2019t say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735420\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20053\">THERAPIST: You want the standard to be the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20055\">CLIENT: Of course, when I go with Ginger and Delia and they\u2019re talking about male dancers, how well-formed their jeans are, and when I\u2019m with other women, I say that.

It\u2019s a way of being respectful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20059\">CLIENT: I think there are a lot of little things I need to talk with Jeremy about, just because little things happen and they sort of accumulate and nothing happens, and then I get frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Resentful. That\u2019s a feeling you were have as you were sitting there doing those crafts. The combination of feeling like he\u2019s not noticing how hard you\u2019re working and maybe not paying attention to how his words make you feel, not giving credit to some of that.
