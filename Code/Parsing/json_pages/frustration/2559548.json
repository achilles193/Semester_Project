That's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh, did he...? It wasn't...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT 1: Yeah. He was yelling at him because he wouldn't move up, and then he rear-ended him, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT 2: Yeah. We had cars in front of us, and I was moving forward. I was... because everybody was stopped, I was slowly moving up to the car in front of me. And the guy's just leaning on the horn, he beeps three times. And I pull forward, and then I stop like anybody else would moving forward, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">the guy just cracked (ph) right back into the back of the car. [0:01:00] I don't know. Anyway... (Pause) Just another day. Thankfully that police officer was nice. The guy jumped out, and he was like, what are doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT 1: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT 2: I'm like, are you kidding me? You hit a parked car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT 1: And he was like, there's no damage is there? There's no damage, huh? And I'm like, well, I don't know if there's damage or not (chuckling). People are crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT 1: So I have the paperwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay, great. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT 1: Do you want to take...? We left off at pretty much, we had a horrible fight in session. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT 1: We want to learn how to deal with our frustrations better than taking it out on each other. But we're not sure how to do that. [0:02:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Is that what you guys talked about after you left?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT 1: I don't think we really talked. (Chuckling) You did your thing. He like... I was upset, so he comforted me. And then I was upset the next day, but we just kind of went on from there. And the rest of the week's been fine. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Is that...? When did that shift? Because you guys were fight... when did it shift to you comforting Marlene?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT 1: That day (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT 2: I don't know, yeah, later on in the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: What changed in you from being upset to going to comfort her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT 2: To be honest with you, I don't even remember any more. I don't even really remember much (chuckling). It's been such a crazy week. [0:02:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT 1: I think I just told him, I need to be comforted. And (inaudible at 0:03:03) we need to stop arguing. And then I told him that we need to put more effort into this. It's been... it was a very busy week for us, and we didn't spend any time together. And then he talked... it upset me that he <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">said he wanted even less time with me. And then he spent... like, this week... we have time together this week. We needed that time (inaudible at 0:03:37).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: And that made a big difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What...? [Something else] (ph)... what do you think...? Oh, are you done with this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT 2: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: That's your... I'll take the forms, and this is yours. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT 2: Oh, okay. I didn't know whose was what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, do you feel, Steve, you're making more of an effort to spend time with Marlene? [0:03:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT 2: Well, it's not all of a sudden like a light went on. I mean, I'm consciously trying to be there for her. We're in a relationship, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559548\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, do you feel...? Because it sounds like, Marlene, you felt there was a difference between this past week and the week before. Do you feel there was as big a difference, or do you feel that... in terms of how much time you spent together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT 2: It's so difficult because it's like, every day is different it seems. It really just depends on the day (chuckling). It's... we go day by day. At least, that's how I feel. I mean, things can change in a heartbeat. So, I mean, I still feel the same way. I still... I'm still going to approach <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">everything the same way when we're together. [0:04:59] And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I guess what I'm trying to understand is, it's... from Marlene's vantage point it seemed like you made a different kind of effort. So I was wondering whether it just felt like it was just a change in the week or you felt that it was something different on your part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT 2: (Chuckling) Just did my thing. I just opened up, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, he... I've noticed a lot of changes. Even yesterday, you sat down, and you talked about people at work and friends, and you never do that with me. I was like, oh, well, that's interesting. It was nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, well, I felt like I could talk to you, just talk to you, talk to you, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT 2: I never get that feeling, but I just felt like I could just... you know, whatever. [0:05:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You felt you could talk to her versus what? What is not feeling like you can talk to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT 2: Well, as opposed to me not watching what I say and how I say it and... (Pause) As it is opposed to that (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, and I feel like because I've done that to him, he feels that way. It's like I can't redeem myself even if I try my hardest. He still has... I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT 2: Hesitation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT 1: Oh, she needs this, and then I'm just being honest. And there's nothing... I'm not trying to pull anything on him. I'm just being straightforward, and he thinks there's something behind it still. So that's frustrating. [0:06:56] (Pause) But I feel like I'm trying to start anew. And I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">you to try to forgive me and see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT 2: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can do that. (Pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad this week was a better week for you guys. And I want to take up with what you were saying in terms of arguing with... arguing better or arguing less or both?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT 1: I think we still had our arguments. I just feel like it wasn't all week. I mean, we had one night of an argument, and then it was, like, he recognized my feelings, and he had some remorse? And that made me respond to him better. And he normally doesn't have any remorse, or under... like, if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">I'm upset, he gets angry instead of like, oh, why are you upset? [0:07:57] He gets angry and wants to go away. The fight or flight. He wants to leave (chuckling), so (inaudible at 0:08:05)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT 2: Well, yeah, I do that because of usually how you act when you're doing it, when you're upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT 2: That's all. That's why I do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT 1: And I normally need you there when I'm upset instead of taking off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT 2: Well, [I ask you then] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT 1: And he did better with that, and if he was wrong he would say, I'm sorry for this. And that makes it better.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559548\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. The acknowledging part...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: It seems like was a big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, absolutely. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT 2: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Did it feel different for you, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT 2: It felt like a normal week (chuckling). (inaudible at 0:08:53) I didn't change anything. It just felt like a normal week to me for the most part. [0:08:59] Just felt like we... just things were easier, and it was more of a flow. It was just less butting heads and stepping on each other's toes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">Or at least that's kind of what I got out of it because usually we're butting heads. (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT 1: We had more time with each other this week, too. We weren't just going to bed and going to sleep. We spent time with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT 2: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT 1: So I think that's part of it. If you're not in a good situation, you never see that person, you're just running about, everything's an annoyance. And you just don't feel like you're in a relationship or you're connecting with that person if you never see them. [0:09:56] So I think that's some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">of our difficulties. Well, I feel that way. That's how I feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well, it also sounds like... I guess I'm wondering... it seems like for you, Steve, sometimes when Marlene is upset...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT 2: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You feel like, oh my God, I can't say anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT 2: No, no, it's not like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, it's not... I mean, sometimes, I didn't mean all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, he's like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT 2: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: When you feel you can't talk freely is when Marlene's just... you feel Marlene's reacting. I guess... well, let me finish the second part of my question, then you could maybe say that the way I'm thinking about it isn't right. But it seems like sometimes when Marlene's upset, you feel like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">oh, I have to watch everything I say. I can't sort of speak freely. And then sometimes... like, it sounds like last week when she was upset you comforted her. I mean, that's a very different reaction to... so I don't know if you just... like, it was something you thought about or you just felt it differently? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A92\">Do you have a thought about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT 2: No, I mean, I felt normal. It felt right, you know? [0:10:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT 1: You said you felt bad. You felt bad that we fought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT 2: Well, yeah, I always feel bad when we fight. I never like fighting. That's nothing new. (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT 1: Yeah. I don't know. I guess him acknowledging it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT 1: He didn't feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT 2: I've always told you I can't stand fighting and argument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, but it was different this time. It seemed different. It seemed like you were really genuine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT 2: That's good (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT 1: Yeah. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: So I have a couple of thoughts. I'm glad to hear that you were able to work through something because you left here really in a bad place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT 1: Oh, I know. But that's, like, our fights. And then the next day it's... we're fine. But it's like, when we're in a battle or a fight over something stupid, that's how brutal it gets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT 1: And it's hard to forget that, how we talk to each other. [0:11:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, my one thought about watching you guys last weekend was very... or it certainly impacted... made an impact on me, is that I feel like you guys are tapping into a wound or hurt so deep.

I was giving the example for you. Like, it's just... that's what really stayed with me. And I don't know what these wounds are and why they go so deep? I'm not sure, but that's sort of the impression it made on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT 2: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT 1: Yeah. Well, it feels like that when we fight, for me anyways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, yeah. It's just stuff from last three, four years. It just all adds up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like it's more than just the last three or four years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT 2: No. No. I mean, I know Marlene has (chuckling)... she's got a different opinion, but...

And I'd be like, oh, maybe I'll meet up with you, and then I just went off and did my thing. [What was different when we were younger?] (ph) It's just completely different, completely different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT 1: I don't know, I just... when we fight, it's like we hate each other. There's such passion and hate. So it's dramatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Where do you feel like that's coming from in you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT 1: That's how my family members fight. I would say that's how I would fight with my parents, but... [0:13:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Hmm. And what's that hate about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT 1: I don't know that there's any hate there. We've just always been dramatic people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: I see. I was just... you were saying there's such hate, and then you were saying, my parents (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT 1: No, it just feels like we talk to each other like we're enemies when we fight, instead of in a loving way, like a disagreement. It's like, I don't know... just really seems like he is disgusted with me, and I with him. It's just... I don't know how we can fight in a better way or have a better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F91\">disagreement? How do you control that emotion, I guess, where it's not such a big deal? It's not like tearing apart our relationship. [0:14:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: With your parents, what similarity were you drawing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT 1: Well, my mother was... or my father was always, like, everything was a big deal. And it was, like, we'd have a fight, but the next day it's like it never happened. But it was still wicked dramatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT 1: So with us we... that... our fights go on, like that damage, or those feelings, those hurt feelings are still there, where with my parents it's like we never would talk about it again (chuckling). So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Did it stay with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: But you had a sense it didn't stay with them? Or it just didn't... wasn't acknowledged?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT 1: Wasn't acknowledged. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: I see. And what were the fights about? Anything in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT 1: Just school, what I wanted to do with my life, or anything they didn't agree with, because they always had a tight hold, like, everything they were afraid of (chuckling). [0:16:01] It seems like they didn't know... if they didn't know something, then they didn't want me to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2010C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559548\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT 1: It was the same with college and even relationships. Like, before I moved out, I didn't have my parents' permission. They still think I should be living at home, which makes no sense. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Do they think you should be living at home forever?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT 1: No, but until I'm married or financially stable, they think that. Yeah. So my mom's definitely against living with somebody before marriage?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Does she give you a hard time about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT 1: Well, any time we fight and I talk to her about it, she'll be like, well, it's not good to live outside of marriage. But she did it with my father, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT 1: But it's just, like, how she's religious, and she blames it on that. [0:17:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Even though she did it herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT 1: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT 1: Very young.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT 1: It's do what I say not as I do kind of thing in our house.

[0:17:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">CLIENT 1: My mom... my dad more so than my mom. Like, my mom would like to do a lot more, but my father's, like, never had a vacation in his life. You have to force him to do stuff like that. He's very routine and old school. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">THERAPIST: To just... I'm sorry, I have allergies. To answer your question about sort of how do you fight less intensely or how do you sort of not feel like you're fighting to the end or something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">THERAPIST: And there's a couple of answers to that. I mean, one is to understand what is getting stirred up...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">THERAPIST: What this immediate fight over the garbage is stirring up, right? Because it's probably... I'm giving... I guess you guys do sort of fight about chores, but I'm sort of just giving it as a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">CLIENT 2: No, yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I understand what you're saying. [0:18:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Right. So it's, like, what's at stake with...? What does this mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">CLIENT 2: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">THERAPIST: This clearly... there's the... there's a text and then there's a subtext. It's, like, what's really going on, the subtitles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">CLIENT 2: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">THERAPIST: So that's one way to handle it. We have been, I think, starting to talk about that. Like, what's at stake in this fight? What are you guys really fighting about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">CLIENT 2: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">THERAPIST: And sort of understanding that I think really can help diffuse the immediate topics, that's one way. The other way, and it sounds like... these are... they're not... they can all happen at once. And this is really hard at the moment, but it sounds like you guys did it after, is try to put <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D1\">your hurt aside for a moment and, what is the other person trying to say to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2015C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559548\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT 2: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">THERAPIST: Like, just... and it's so hard in the heat of the moment. It's like, you're hurt is everything. It takes up your entire field of vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">THERAPIST: There's nothing else you can see. And, if there's any way to even just move it slightly... so even if your left eye, out of the corner of your left eye you can see something else, it really makes things very, very different...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">CLIENT 2: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Because you guys... I mean, some couples really are going out to hurt each other. [0:20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">THERAPIST: I mean, they are. I don't see that in you. I see that you're hearing things in a way that feels so wounding, and then maybe you can try to wound the other person out of reaction or defense at that but not because you want to be mean to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">CLIENT 2: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">THERAPIST: You guys don't want to be mean to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">CLIENT 2: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">THERAPIST: You love each other, and you want to get along better. And so it seems like when that consumes you, like it did last week, it's very hard to think outside of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">CLIENT 2: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017F\">THERAPIST: And then around that, I mean, there's often strategies to just how you stop yourself in the moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">CLIENT 1: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: There's sort of very basic... sort of around slowing that down rather than just reacting and being kind of consumed with your own hurt. And they're (ph) easier said and done. But some couples really find that, if they try to actually practice it, they get better when they're practicing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">THERAPIST: So that's more of a kind of a practical approach to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">CLIENT 2: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">THERAPIST: I think both are important because what's at stake in these fights I think is very important. To see the pain that each of you express, I mean, it's just... I mean, it really made a deep impact on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018D\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F\">CLIENT 2: Hmm. [0:21:03] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20191\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20193\">CLIENT 2: So those are both very good ways of trying to break down an argument or a disagreement about something, come to, I guess, a resolution. Yeah. Those both run through my mind every time we get into an argument about something, like, is this...? One, is it really worth it? And two, all right, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201931\">let's try to focus on what she's telling but what she's not... what she's telling me, but what she's not saying telling me, you know what I mean? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20195\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20197\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, if I'm emotional, I have a hard time expressing what the issue is (chuckling), so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20199\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, but both of those things went through my head, especially when we get into arguments about stupid stuff. [0:22:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B\">CLIENT 1: Everything's so silly, too, after you look at it. Like, it wasn't worth it. So... and then we get it later on, like, you understand what the other person was saying. So... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">THERAPIST: I mean, in these moments, it seems like it boils down to you, Marlene, feeling so profoundly rejected...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">CLIENT 1: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Rejected.

[0:22:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">CLIENT 2: No. I like being unique (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Well, it's about... there's something about freedom. Like, you kept saying your free time, like, Marlene's trying to interfere with your free time and your space. And there's something about that. I mean, it was just very poignant. It was something that was just heartbreaking to you about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, I just... no, that's just when I was talking about it. I think we were talking about when I get time to do stuff and whether I'm able to just go to the mall or... I don't know (chuckling). It's a bad example, I guess. Just in the moment just go do something. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, I can get better at that (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, we can work on that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT 1: But most of the time we're not around each other, and it's not a problem. [0:23:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">CLIENT 2: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">CLIENT 1: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT 2: Well, we (chuckling)... obviously it's not a problem if you're not around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT 1: Yeah. It's just more, like, he used to want to take me places like that. Now it's about getting his free time. So I was getting hurt by that. I understand. I mean, I get a lot of free time, and, if I didn't have that, I'd probably go crazy, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">CLIENT 2: Hmm, well, not that I don't think you ever thought about this, but being an only child, living by myself, I was always trying to get out the door. And you know this, when I was living at my parents' house? My mother and my mother's boyfriend? Always trying to get out, just to get out to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB1\">something. So just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Were they... did they like to kind of take your...? What...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">CLIENT 2: No, I just... I never got along with my mother's boyfriend when I was younger. We get along fine now. [0:24:58] But just I was always just trying to get out to go hang out with my friends because there was nothing to do my... my mother's house is very small, there's a loft upstairs, two bedrooms <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF1\">and a bathroom downstairs, there's a kitchen, a living room, and that's it (chuckling). And it drives me crazy. I used to live in a bigger house, and, when you do live in a bigger house, you get that sense of, all right, well, I'll spend some time over here. And then, if I want, I can go over here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF2\">or I can go over there, rather than taking off and going down the road to do something. It's different when... at least for me. I know it's different for everybody, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">CLIENT 1: Like, [so you can get your privacy] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, right now we can only go upstairs or downstairs. Sometimes I like to go down the road to do something, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">THERAPIST: So this was... you moved into a smaller house when your parents divorced?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">CLIENT 2: Well, yeah, my father got transferred. We were living in Virginia. He was working for a big machining company. [0:25:59] And yeah, we... he got transferred to the Maryland location, so we had to relocate from Virginia to Maryland. And yeah, we had to get a smaller... I went from being in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201D71\">pretty... a fairly good sized house to a... I don't know, I can't... I don't know the name of it, but like a split-up...

And there's two double doors, there's two doors right in the middle of the front of the house? We went to that and then went from that to the house that we were waiting to be built. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF1\">Anyway, [I'm going on] (ph). But, I don't know, just something about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">CLIENT 2: Yeah, yeah. When I don't hang out with friends and I'm not hanging out with Marlene, sometimes it's just good for me to get out and have time to myself so I can feel like I can move around. [0:27:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT 1: Which you've been doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">CLIENT 2: Hmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT 1: He's been biking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: You guys like biking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT 2: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, we're right by a trail, so we can just go outside.

I need to charge you a little bit more for the sessions before that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">CLIENT 1: Okay, yeah. I'm going to go through the insurance and everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, okay. You can look it over, we'll figure...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">CLIENT 1: Is that...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine.

[0:27:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Okay, all right, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">CLIENT 1: And hopefully if I send this other statement [I'll make my deductible] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20213\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, that first statement, so did you send that in yet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20215\">CLIENT 1: Yeah, I called.

I'm... my Tuesdays keep shifting.
