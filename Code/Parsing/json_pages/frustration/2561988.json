Just, you know, the thing that ignited\u2026 or touched on it, maybe that third rail is that constant that\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s like needing, that deep needing to be liked.

And I think one of the great things about my dad is I knew him kind of as a little girl and my daddy, but then I knew him as a man, and his faults, and all his impatience, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20436\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20437\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20438\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20439\">THERAPIST: And we had a really close relationship. A friendship as well as, you know, he was my dad, right. And despite my knowing a lot of his flaws, and him definitely knowing mine, right, that just allowed me to see him as a human being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2043A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2043B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2043C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2043D\">THERAPIST: Not a perfect human being, but a human being.

Knowing that he, you know, got angry at times, or, you know, got sad\u2014I remember the first time he ever cried, my mother\u2019s father had passed away, I\u2019d never seen that before, I was ten\u2014and sort of knowing him as a human being really sort of allows me, even as a middle-aged woman, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N204411\">have internalized the relationship. And it\u2019s just with me all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20442\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20443\">CLIENT: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20444\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20445\">THERAPIST: Right.

Why are you not embracing that? That\u2019s something to be proud of. I mean, in some ways that\u2019s who you are. You didn\u2019t come from that. My dad didn\u2019t either. His parents were crazy, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2044E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2044F\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20450\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20451\">THERAPIST: You know, and abusive people.

And I remember you telling me <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N204611\">you actively tried to be more physically affectionate with your kids than you got, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20462\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20463\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20464\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20465\">THERAPIST: Ain\u2019t no parent in the world perfect.
