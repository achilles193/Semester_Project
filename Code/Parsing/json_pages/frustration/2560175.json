Just busy working. Me and Steve really didn\u2019t fight. And I\u2019ve just been positive. No like drastic emotions or anything like that, so \u2013 just overwhelmed by school. And I started school and like all my schedule has kind of flip-flopped from days to nights so that\u2019s challenging. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">Which I wanted to talk to you about because I won\u2019t be able to come next week but if you have anything on Friday in the morning I might be able to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I might have something \u2013 let me check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(Pause): [00:03:09 00:03:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I have 11:45.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: On Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Can you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Actually, 11:50. So, 11:50?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019ll put you in for then. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve just been feeling like panicky lately, just like right now coming here makes me a little anxious. But at work like when I have to go to my shift I feel like talking myself down because my heart starts racing with everything happening it\u2019s randomly and nothing like seems to trigger it. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">just feel real anxious and I just like take deep breaths and ignore it pretty much. Then in like an hour or so I seem more relaxed but it take me that long to relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Did you get my e-mail about Dr. Levin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I called her today to see if I can make an appointment next week but the week after that for a four-hour session. We\u2019ll see when she gets back. I don\u2019t know what the fuck to talk about today. Is there anything that like we should talk about from like last week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: What feels important to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I mean I\u2019m happy about getting help. I feel I\u2019m very positive about that. This week was normal, you know. Like I functioned well. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve just been really tired which is understandable with my job. That\u2019s why I question why am I so tired? Is it my job or something else going on? I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">feel like I could go to sleep all day and like wake up and still feel tired. But my manager has me on days and then straight to nights for like four days. Like I\u2019ll work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday like day shift and then Thursday I\u2019ll come in at like 11:30 or 7:30 and then work nights for three days. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">It\u2019s miserable. So that could be it. I just wish I had more energy pretty much. There is so much more I\u2019d like to do other than just like work and sleep. But I don\u2019t know. The floor is very busy. I\u2019m not the only one. I like ask all the nurses just like do you ever just like you have a good stress but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200333\">it\u2019s like so stressful you just hold everything in and then you go home and you just fall apart? And they\u2019re like, oh yeah, we do that once a week. I think that\u2019s hard on my relationship because I\u2019m always so preoccupied. Like yesterday I got home from work. I was fine and was outside and we live on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200334\">a lake right by the water and the outside just felt relaxing. And he called on his way home and I was just like, hi. And he was like, I just said, hi, and he was like, is something wrong? And I\u2019m like, that kind of \u2013 I was like why would there be anything wrong and then he got upset. Like, isn\u2019t that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200335\">a weird way to start a conversation?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560175\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure how to answer that (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Like you say hi and the other person says, \u2018is something wrong?\u2019 I mean that\u2019s weird. The question is how do you think something\u2019s wrong if the person just said, hi. So I think after all this and like telling Steve that like emotionally something\u2019s wrong he always thinks something\u2019s wrong now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">He\u2019s always like concerned about me kind of. You\u2019d think that would be nice but it\u2019s kind of like aggravating. I mean I have bad days and good days but to feel like it\u2019s going to be a bad day for me kind of like sets you up for failure. And then when he asks is something wrong? I\u2019ll like read into it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">I\u2019ll think why would there be anything wrong? Like, do you have a guilty conscience? Like I feel, I like read into stuff like that way too much. But when we got off the phone we were like (unclear) with each other and it\u2019s just like something like that, then he just said he can\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200373\">we\u2019ve (unclear) to talk about it. I guess I don\u2019t make good first impressions. So that\u2019s like really aggravating. And then this week (unclear) said they were going to a wedding and I feel like it\u2019s just like a burden, not something to look forward to for some reason. I wish I could get excited about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200374\">social events and not just trying to like get through it. And I always think like whenever we go to anything social we\u2019re going to fight. So I worry about that. It seems like it\u2019s more like a pain in the ass than something happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You just said, \u2018we\u2019re going to fight,\u2019 and that upset you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Every time we go out we always like have some \u2013 we clash. Like someone always feels left out. He\u2019s not very social so he\u2019ll like sit down and he feels ignored like \u2018you didn\u2019t even sit next to me or something like that. You didn\u2019t spend time with me. So it usually escalates. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">at this wedding I only know the bride so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s very social and he doesn\u2019t like to dance. I don\u2019t know. Any time we go out anywhere we always have some misunderstanding and we get in a fight. And it\u2019s like either I\u2019m setting myself up to fight with him like I\u2019m not going into it positively <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">or it\u2019s just like us clashing anytime at stressful events or (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">So would go to these weddings and like parties and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to get into a fight and we always did after like (unclear). So I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m just like setting myself up to fail pretty much, by thinking negatively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: By setting yourself up, developing your theme and you\u2019re acting on it somehow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. Subconsciously. Like I guess if you have negative thoughts and that stresses you out if you think negatively and you\u2019re like a tense person and then somebody just like is being tough with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: He knows me. He knows how I react to things. And that sets him off. Like we\u2019re just like reacting to each other. So I\u2019m kind of stressed out about that. The whole wedding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">(Pause): [00:13:18 00:13:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Is there like any advice you could give me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: About what to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Like what would kind of \u2013 what would you want to do differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Like just think. Think more positively like I\u2019m not so stressed out before I go to a social event.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560175\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019d like to change your thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see. And how would you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Instead of like being stressed out I\u2019d be excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I see. So you\u2019d just have different thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how to control one\u2019s thoughts. It sounds great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, like just being more positive. Have you ever been in a situation where you\u2019re like just nervous and how to like self-talk yourself through it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I see. What would that self-talk look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Just like you\u2019re going to have a good time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Nothing\u2019s going to go wrong. Like, just relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019d say reassuring things to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right. And moods. I think I go like overboard or like I\u2019ll start planning like the wedding or whatever, and getting everything together so like I\u2019m not stressed out. But if I don\u2019t have enough time to prepare myself I just feel like I\u2019m stressed going to the wedding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s particularly because you\u2019ll be going with Steve and you\u2019re worried about fighting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s part of it.

Everything? It\u2019s different if I don\u2019t know anybody there and have a good time. If I know people I feel like, I don\u2019t know, somehow I have to impress them. Like dress really nice and be perfect. I\u2019m like I\u2019m a perfectionist when I go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So you have to be perfect for them or for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: For them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Because that\u2019s what other people expect of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what they expect of me.

We don\u2019t really know anybody so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: What is it about knowing someone that makes you \u2013 or knowing the people there that makes you more anxious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess like judgment. I think it\u2019s more I get anxious and then when I\u2019m there I realize like it\u2019s not the worst situation and I usually have a good time. It\u2019s just like I get stressed like on the way there. Like are we going to be late? We\u2019re always like feeling we don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">enough time and then we\u2019re running late and I feel bad about that.

Like Steve has situations, like Steve worries about money. Of course he worries about dressing up and everything but it\u2019s like he always just feels bad (unclear) like not being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">able to like pay for a drink or whatever. He worries about that.

He finally relaxes and understands like I\u2019ll give him some money to pay for the drinks, whatever. And like in the beginning he doesn\u2019t really make me feel bad but I feel bad because what he says is like, I feel really bad about not having any money <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">to pay for things. It\u2019s like I feel horrible. And that like makes me feel horrible.

Just very intense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Well, it also seems important to you to be able to determine what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not. You use those terms a lot \u2013 that\u2019s normal, that\u2019s weird. Trying to kind of organize things somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: I guess, categorize them. Well, because I always over-react about things so it\u2019s like, for me it\u2019s like how everybody acts and what am I over-reacting about and what needs to be an extreme case and how should I behave in a situation in a like positive way? That\u2019s like with my relationship, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">like I feel when like something happens it\u2019s like the worst, the end of the world. But I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, what I should be upset about and like how to react. Do you know what I mean? Like, is it just me making things up in my head or is it something I should pay attention to? Like a judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And that feels confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Um hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">(Pause): [00:23:32 00:23:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Nowadays, it\u2019s kind of like I can\u2019t say that, probably like for this whole week like if me and Steve act like (unclear) I wouldn\u2019t carry it out I was kind of quiet or like going to bed and ignoring it. But it\u2019s just like it\u2019s still there. Instead of being aggressive about it and trying to analyze <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">everything and trying to talk about it with him. I can\u2019t \u2013 I really don\u2019t know how to talk things out with him. He like tunes me out. Sometimes it\u2019s like easier to avoid things, which works for our relationship I guess, because we\u2019re not fighting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: But something else is missing or not working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: We don\u2019t have an intimacy at all and like I\u2019ve brought this up before and he blames it on me because I said he had a problem and now he has like performance anxiety and then I take that as he doesn\u2019t find me attractive. So it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s a mess. So we both don\u2019t know where to get through that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">wall to get to where we were before. Because we were always like so into each other, very, very attracted to each other and now I don\u2019t know how to react.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">(Pause): [00:25:42 00:25:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Which is what? It\u2019s dysfunctional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Because it feels like coming together can be \u2013 go badly, sexually and otherwise it sounds like which is why you feel anxious being with him at a wedding and what would happen. Well on sort of a practical level I\u2019ve thought about this for the past couple of weeks and it seems like for a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">reasons we decided the two of us to meet individually versus couples and I enjoy meeting with you and I think that this \u2013 we should keep doing this. I do. And I do wonder whether you guys could also see someone separately and see someone other than me, the two of you, and maybe closer to home so that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C52\">some of the logistical problems you were having could be kind of cut down, be minimized. What do you think about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560175\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d go for that. And Tuesdays are his only day off and that\u2019s the problem that he can\u2019t fit anything else in. He likes just to do his own thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">(Pause): [00:27:05 00:27:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll talk to him about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: He came here. He did. Unless that was an illusion. Do you have any reservations on your part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Well, he tells me that there\u2019s nothing we need to do in therapy that we can\u2019t fix on our own. He says that it\u2019s our responsibility to fix it and not to see somebody. He doesn\u2019t believe like that\u2019s necessary. So I\u2019m like, okay. And it\u2019s like pick and choose your battles, you know. He\u2019s so dead <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">set on not seeing somebody, I can\u2019t force him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: But he came here. He did come here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: I think it was just an extreme case of like I don\u2019t know. I think I like forced him to come here. And I don\u2019t want to do that. I want him to feel like, okay. You know. I\u2019d said to him, if you want to work on our relationship I have a therapist and it\u2019s either that or we might break up. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">I gave him an ultimatum or I threatened him and I mean he came here but he wasn\u2019t happy about it. And like getting him here was the most stressful thing. And the car ride was horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Because he was complaining?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Because he was just being quiet and he wouldn\u2019t talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s when I know like something\u2019s wrong with him because he\u2019ll just get quiet and ignore me. He\u2019s in his own \u2013 I take it that he\u2019s ignoring me. He\u2019s not ignoring me. You just can feel the tension in the car, you know? That\u2019s stressful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s why you\u2019d be going to a couple\u2019s therapist, because there\u2019s tension in your relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to make you do something you don\u2019t want to do, for sure. It was an idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: If there\u2019s something (unclear) we can do I want to talk to you about your role in it and your distress in it, too, but \u2013 You guys talked when you were here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Did we?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Um hmm. You did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s hard to remember it. Only therapists had afternoon sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Only therapists have afternoon sessions, like evening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Some therapists do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: They do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Oh, okay. That would help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: That would be your concern logistically?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: Um hmm. I would have a time getting him like to go get his GED like after work or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: When is he done with work usually?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s different every day. If he gets a day shift he\u2019ll be home at like 4, but usually he has evenings or nights so sometimes he goes into work at like 12. Yeah, maybe we could do a morning session if I was working nights. But he sleeps like until he has to go to work, he\u2019ll sleep and he wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB1\">get up. And he\u2019s like a monster in the morning. You can\u2019t even talk to him for like a couple of hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200FA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560175\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Just one woman\u2019s experience, but he didn\u2019t seem like a monster to me when he came here in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. He\u2019s good at putting on a show. No. He\u2019s good at like in front of people being very charismatic and friendly, but like in the morning he\u2019s \u2013 you can\u2019t even talk to him and he tells me that. I\u2019m just not awake, just please give me time, I\u2019m not awake yet. A very different person to live <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF1\">with. Like I see the good side of him like you saw, like I know that\u2019s there. It\u2019s just living with each other. I didn\u2019t expect it to be like \u2013 I expected him to like me as his girlfriend and like to be not so comfortable all the time like you are with your family. And I feel like he moved in and he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF2\">acted like the same way he acted at his house, like his mother took care of the cleaning, and like made him lunch and like mothered him. So like he doesn\u2019t do anything \u2013 he doesn\u2019t do anything for himself, you know. So it\u2019s aggravating. And he very much likes me to do stuff for him, like make his lunch <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF3\">or do his laundry and clean up, but I don\u2019t look at a relationship that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">Like either I look at it as you\u2019re a partnership, you\u2019ll clean together, you\u2019ll help each other, you do this chore and I\u2019ll do that chore or you clean up after yourself you know. And he\u2019ll do silly things like he\u2019ll put his trash in a plastic bag and he\u2019ll like hold onto it for a little while and he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">won\u2019t put it in the main trash because, you know, he doesn\u2019t want me to take out the trash like that\u2019s his trash and this is my trash. Okay, like this is my corner where I put all my stuff and the rest \u2013 he doesn\u2019t walk on the floors. It\u2019s funny \u2013 he just thinks that\u2019s his corner and that\u2019s what he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201012\">responsible for. And it\u2019s like, you don\u2019t walk on the floors, you don\u2019t use the bathroom, you know, you don\u2019t use the shower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">I just like think his mother never showed him that kind of responsibility. She just did everything. And I never thought about that. Well, anyway somebody \u2013 because I was responsible for a lot of things when I lived at my house when I started being independent. So I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what we clashed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">on first when we started living with each other. And then we clashed on being responsible to each other like if you\u2019re going to stay out late, if you\u2019re going to do this \u2013 like give me a call, give me a heads up. And he felt like he didn\u2019t have to do that, like he always did. But he felt like if I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201032\">to go out and not come back, like \u2013 that\u2019s why I was like, well, that\u2019s not nice. It\u2019s not going to make me happy. And this is just like stuff he would talk to me about and not that he ever did it \u2013 never did it. He would just tell me this was like \u2013 I\u2019m allowed to do that if I want to. And I\u2019d say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201033\">yeah, of course you are but it\u2019s not nice. So it\u2019s just like \u2013 different living styles. And like he didn\u2019t think of it like you\u2019re living with somebody, you\u2019re a family. Now he does but we battled for like a whole year we battled. What do you think about that? Battle? (Unclear) weird? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Those categories aren\u2019t important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: No, I guess functional \u2013 he wasn\u2019t functional. And I consider functional as like normal for us here. It was chaotic. And he blamed it on working which I didn\u2019t sympathize with because I work a lot of hours, a lot of different hours and I just feel that I have responsibilities that I need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201071\">take care of. And we had a roommate so. That was a different story. Like he had to leave the apartment a mess because there was someone else he had living there, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20106-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20106-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560175\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">(Pause): [00:37:41 00:37:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: In fact, I think that affected our relationship and I feel like now I\u2019m stuck in like this mother role for him and I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t like that either but he\u2019s put me in that weird position. Do you think we can get out of such a habit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: The two of you, or him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: The two of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: I certainly think it\u2019s possible which I think it\u2019s why going back to couple\u2019s therapy would be helpful.

That you can do it on your own versus going to see somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: I think I can change myself, you know. I don\u2019t think I can change him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: When you ask that, are you concerned when you say, \u2018do you think you can change that?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: I would just \u2013 I would hope from a professional\u2019s point of view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Did you find when we met \u2013 the three of us, to be helpful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: I felt like he treated me better. He was nicer. He seems like he really tried, like he was kind of like responsible for something because we met every week and he would make \u2013 he would say held make like a commitment and then he\u2019d (unclear) a commitment, you know. Whereas, if we\u2019re at home he <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">could say these things like I\u2019m going to do this or I\u2019m going to do that but he forgets or he just doesn\u2019t follow through. And I think that\u2019s like what started it the night of the dinner. I was just like really disappointed. And it\u2019s like should I be disappointed? Should I be grateful that he tried? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F2\">Probably. But it\u2019s like he had all day to do that, to think about which (unclear). I pretty much thought it up for him. And he didn\u2019t know what pot to use. He doesn\u2019t know how long to boil something. He had to ask me about everything. Like, my God, how would you ever \u2013 like liver on your own? You know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F3\">So I guess I\u2019m like, judging him, but I just don\u2019t understand I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: Judging him in what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Like do you not feel about not knowing how to boil water kind of thing, you know?

It would be nice if he was a little more independent. Like his, you know, idea of cooking is like having <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B1\">a bowl of ice cream. That\u2019s his dinner and like that\u2019s fine. Like most people, they live together \u2013 a lot of people, they have dinner together and either the boyfriend cooks or the girlfriend cooks. And there\u2019s like function inside of \u2013 like I try maybe if we go grocery shopping to pick up stuff like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B2\">he would want to like cook and stuff but I\u2019d be buying grocery that he would never touch. He like eats at work or he\u2019ll bring home drinks or something that\u2019s a) not healthy, or, b) like it\u2019s expensive to do that as opposed to we\u2019ll just buy groceries, you know, and pack a lunch. But I don\u2019t think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B3\">would ever change it. For one, he doesn\u2019t leave himself enough time, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2012A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560175\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">(Pause): [00:43:32 00:43:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why it just seems like such a big deal for me. I don\u2019t know it just feels like you cook, you have dinner together, you take care of the house together and you do things together, you know, to help make your relationship grow. We do everything separate. And that makes it so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: Does it make you feel alone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. It makes me feel like I have other responsibility that I don\u2019t have if I (unclear) with him. (inaudible) together. It\u2019s like I have a roommate that sleeps next to me. Like today I had to say like, why don\u2019t you take your laundry to your mother\u2019s house, she said she would help <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">you clean it. But if I didn\u2019t say that he wouldn\u2019t do that. He would wait until I came home, you know? And I ended up taking his laundry to my mother\u2019s house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: Because he doesn\u2019t know how to do laundry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Yes. Unless she\u2019s there to help him, he doesn\u2019t. But his mother did his laundry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: So what is your concern in having to do his laundry? I\u2019m not sure I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: I guess that he\u2019s not independent enough to do that stuff on his own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like he would just wear dirty clothes? Like what would happen if you didn\u2019t do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: He does wear dirty clothes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: So you think for months and months he\u2019d wear dirty clothes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Not months and months. No. He\u2019ll eventually won\u2019t, but he will wear some dirty clothes to work. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t take the initiative until it\u2019s too late, until it\u2019s like the last minute and then he\u2019ll say to me, oh my God, I need you to do my laundry. And then I feel like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201431\">guess that\u2019s my fault and I\u2019m like, okay, I\u2019ll do your laundry but I feel bad and I want to help him but like I feel I\u2019m enabling him to do things for himself. Isn\u2019t that silly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re wanting to help him do in those moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: I feel bad that he feels bad that he didn\u2019t get to do his laundry. I don\u2019t want him to feel bad, you know. I want him to be happy so I feel like if I help him with these things, he\u2019ll be happy. And I\u2019m the one that gets burned, not him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: So you feel you\u2019re taking the burden off of him, but then you feel the burden and then you feel angry at him which makes him unhappy and defeats the very purpose that you (unclear) in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: Right. And then he\u2019ll say, well you didn\u2019t have to do it. I didn\u2019t ask you do to it. And then I\u2019m like, and you don\u2019t feel grateful, and adds to the cycle. Like one day I was at work and he was like, oh, I cleaned. I cleaned up a little bit and I was like, oh, wow. He took the initiative to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">clean? And like I told one of my co-workers and I was like, wow, and I was so excited. And when I got home I could not tell what he\u2019d cleaned. I had no idea what he\u2019d cleaned. I was like, oh, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Did you ask him?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2014C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560175\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Nope. I could not tell and I didn\u2019t want to fight with him. You know? So I was like disappointed. I don\u2019t think he knows how to clean. He watches me do it, but \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 if I start cleaning he\u2019ll be like, do you want me to mop that? And he\u2019s like, okay, and then he\u2019ll mop. But it\u2019s like taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">the initiative and doing it like if I come home at night and the living room\u2019s clean and I don\u2019t have to worry about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: (Unclear proper name), we\u2019re going to need to stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: So I\u2019ll see you in a week from Friday at 11:50.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: Okay.

Did you figure that out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: No, my assistant came back at the end of last week and she\u2019ll look into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: Okay. Could you have her to just e-mail me again to see what one\u2019s I should e-mail my insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: Oh, she\u2019s been submitting it the last couple of months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m just not sure that they\u2019re happy about that.

I\u2019ll have her e-mail you July and I guess August, now, since it\u2019s the end of the month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: Okay.
