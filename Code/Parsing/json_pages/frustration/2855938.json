Oh, man. I\u2019m definitely anxious, excited and anxious. I\u2019m not sleeping well. I just want it to be Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Excited and anxious keeping you awake?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. Excited. Like I said, I don\u2019t like traveling until I\u2019m traveling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: The anticipation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. This is a big change, regardless.  It\u2019s a very exciting change, but I\u2019m definitely feeling the kind of physical kind of stuff. Not too bad. I haven\u2019t taken any Ativan or anything. (pause) I just feel antsy. Moneywise, too, this is it. I\u2019m going there with under $2,000. That\u2019s not nothing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to San Diego and trying to live there with $2,000, but without being too hard on myself, I have to definitely try to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Tuck in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m doing it already, but when I meet people face to face and I\u2019m there, I can more easily impart to them that I will have to go back.  Yes, I can stay here or there for a little bit if I really have to. But even that, I just feel excited and like somehow that\u2019s going to work out. So now <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">I just want to pack my shit and go. I\u2019m just ready. (pause) Thank you, though. This has been awesome. This has been so good. I mean, it\u2019s not the end, but this was a big stretch that was really important and I appreciate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re welcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: You bent over backwards, so I appreciate that. Once I\u2019m working I\u2019ll have checks sent electronically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: As you can. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Of course. No, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: It may not be the end, and yet it is also the end of a piece of work for now. It\u2019s been a lot time going and really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: The most important. At least for me it\u2019s been the most important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: [And deeper.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m psyched. I was thinking about it, not as clearly as I\u2019m thinking about it right now, but I\u2019m realizing that part of this antsy-ness and this anxiety, but that I\u2019m feeling in a good way, is because I think I\u2019m doing something that many people in my family have never done, which is just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">being open to good things.  It\u2019s as simple as that. Period. (laughs) Like just being open to good things. And that makes me anxious because that\u2019s not my background. So now that I\u2019m much better at that, there is still a little bit of this component that makes me feel . . . something. I think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">a big part of it, a huge, huge part of it. I\u2019ll give you a little example. Yesterday my mom asked, \u201cHow are you going to get to the airport?\u201d No, two things. First on Tuesday she was like, \u201cOh, there is supposed to be a big storm.\u201d That may be true; it\u2019s been a shitty winter.  But right there it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">a negative spin. That\u2019s one; but even the bigger one, to me, the more telling one that made me think of this is that she was like, \u201cWho is going to take you to the airport?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll figure it out. One of my friends can.\u201d She said, \u201cWell haven\u2019t they offered?\u201d It just annoys me because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200294\">she\u2019s just assuming. I was like, \u201cYou know what? Don\u2019t get involved. Don\u2019t meddle in my friendships.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of stuff I can\u2019t be around anymore. It\u2019s such a little thing, but it\u2019s not. Why is your mind going there? \u201cHaven\u2019t they offered?\u201d That\u2019s the difference here. That\u2019s the difference. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855938\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And that reaction \u2013 it\u2019s negative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I also don\u2019t like the fact at how annoyed I get with her, but over the last year I\u2019ve cut myself so much slack because I live there. Of course I get fucking annoyed. The reason people don\u2019t get as annoyed is because they live separately. That\u2019s the point. That\u2019s why people joke about their <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">parents, like \u201cI went for Thanksgiving and I was . . .\u201d They can joke about it because they went, it drove them crazy, and then they left. Or whatever \u2013 it didn\u2019t drive them crazy, but these little annoyances that become something don\u2019t have to when you know that it\u2019s okay, she\u2019s annoying you, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">don\u2019t have to respond or get worked up because I\u2019m about to leave and go back to Lexington or wherever the fuck it is. Then she took it further. \u201cDon\u2019t get angry. What is this anger?\u201d That\u2019s her big thing with me, that I\u2019m so angry \u2013 which, of course, makes me more annoyed.  \u201cThis anger that you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">is so unhealthy.\u201d And then last night she was like, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Other mothers talk with their sons all the time about everything.\u201d (chuckling) She does that, too, sometimes, and it\u2019s just like dude, okay. I don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t win so you just have to cut your ties, to some extent. Not cut <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">your ties, but your living-in-the-same-house ties, you have to cut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: As you say, \u201cI\u2019m doing something that my family hasn\u2019t done before, being open to something good.\u201d It\u2019s doing something you also haven\u2019t done before for this very reason. You\u2019re a little kid and you open your heart up to hoping for good things and they come and then you get slapped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Or even when they do come, \u201chow many pages is your book?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a consciously-overt kind of thing. That\u2019s still a real, little backhand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, that shit adds up year after year after year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Of course. There is never anything straightforwardly good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: They can\u2019t leave something be. And it\u2019s not just me. They do it to each other, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: \u201cHoney, I want to tell you my girlfriends are coming to pick me up. We\u2019re going to go to the lunch,\u201d or whatever. That sounds all great to me. I\u2019m like, \u201cGood. Awesome, mom. Go. Tell them I said hi.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll go.\u201d It\u2019s like why are you being a little wuss? Go to lunch <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">and have a good time. Is that what you think of yourself? Do you not deserve it? Everything is like this. And they\u2019re all like this. My uncle is like this, to some extent, too. How much money do you need to stop being a constant stress case? They all just can\u2019t just chill. They can\u2019t chill. And that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">why, in retrospect, when I think about it \u2013 I can\u2019t prove anything \u2013 but I wonder if this really drove my dad crazy. I\u2019m not saying it caused anything. Lots of people are stressed their whole lives. It\u2019s not about the fact that he died or not, but when I think back on it, how would you be married and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">raise a child and deal with the whole fucking family? That must have driven him nuts. (pause) Thanks to the work I\u2019ve done, I can cut her slack.  I can give her credit, but those are two separate things. My childhood insanities are now better, but now it\u2019s only better if \u2013 I still can\u2019t live there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855938\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And now you can start to see her as a person who has a lot of deficits. As a kid, you can\u2019t. Kids don\u2019t look at their parents and say, \u201cHow sad for my mother that she can\u2019t just be unconditionally positive about me. What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d You feel it about yourself. That\u2019s all you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">How they treat you is what you end up knowing about yourself, so why would you (inaudible at 00:10:46) to the rest of your life for me to open to good things? Every time you opened up, you got hurt with her. I think there still may be complexities with the relationship with your father that we haven\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">touched upon yet, but I think, at least, at one level it felt like he was good for you and then you lost him. So it\u2019s another having this good thing and then you lose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Followed by all these other losses. Because as much as I have problems with them, I\u2019m close to them so it\u2019s still traumatic to lose. In that way I think it\u2019s adding to the nervousness and excitement, anticipatory that I would be showing \u2013 anybody would be feeling \u2013 when they\u2019re about to go on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">a trip. But this is extra. I\u2019m ready to go. What other errands can I possibly run now? It is what it is. I\u2019m going to pack, throw the cat in the bag and go. It is what it is now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is good. I\u2019ve got my place settled over there. I heard from my friend, so that\u2019s not up in the air or whatever. My other friend, Liam, from here \u2013 this weird Darien crew over there. These are guys who, especially when we were like 17, 18, 19, 20, we hung out together. He just called <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">me and was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to be there two or three weeks after you get there. I\u2019ll be there for 15 days.\u201d It\u2019s good. This is so not like going to London. (laughs) It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s cool. Exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Again, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s not going to be London.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. And the money thing \u2013 that part of me is trying to find something, like \u201cYou\u2019re going to run out of money and it\u2019s going to fucking suck. You\u2019re going to have to ask Diego to borrow.\u201d  And I really doubt that. Anything is possible, but I really doubt that that\u2019s going to be the case. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">But that part of me wants to find something. It can\u2019t just sit still and be like \u2013 cool. And I\u2019ve noticed that in the past, but I\u2019ve never been able to articulate it like this. It\u2019s very hard for me to just fucking chill. I have that demeanor, which I\u2019m grateful for. I have this very calm, even-keel demeanor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: On the outside?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it\u2019s generally been difficult. It\u2019s gotten better and better and better and better, but . . . (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I know this seems really basic to say, but it\u2019s a very anxious voice, too. Not only is it critical, but there is something \u2013 this is what comes out, also, in your mother about how you\u2019re going to get to the airport or there is a bad storm today. It\u2019s really, really ridden with anxiety. Now <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">imagine you\u2019re three and this is how she\u2019s responding to things that are going on with you inside your body, inside your mind. You\u2019re living in a sea of anxiety, so of course you get anxious now or of course you\u2019ve been working on trying not to get anxious about things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855938\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: And what\u2019s even worse, it would be different if it was her, but the rest of her family wasn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Right. Everyone is like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s just like everyone is like that. It\u2019s exhausting, too. It\u2019s very exhausting. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like worst-case scenario kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Exactly. Everything is always worst case. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly what it is.  Everything always goes to the worst-case scenario. So then when good things to happen, it\u2019s like \u2013 ehh. It\u2019s extremes. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to find a good job.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the president of the university.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">Can we just chill out and can I just have some job that\u2019s decent? Both extremes are worked up. It\u2019s fucking brutal. I don\u2019t know. In some ways, I\u2019m going back and forth. Yesterday I was like yes, I\u2019ll see my grandmother; and today I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how this is going to play out. Even <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">that, it\u2019s almost like I just want to remember her . . . I don\u2019t know.  I can\u2019t make up my mind about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: When you say I just want to remember . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: You know. Of all my cousins, I have spent the most time with this woman. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to see her because I haven\u2019t seen her. I\u2019d rather just remember that instead of maybe going there and it being awkward, especially if my fucking aunt is there or something. Then I\u2019m going to leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">and I don\u2019t want that to trigger something with my mom. There are just things that I have to take into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s more complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: It\u2019s more complicated. It would be different if she were somewhere where I could go by myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I was wondering. If she were in a nursing home right now, would that . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah. I would have already gone even before this. Not just to say goodbye, but just to go visit her. I miss my grandma.  But now that this situation has happened, the fact that she\u2019s not going to remember. She\u2019s not going to remember that I came to say hi. Plus with my mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">and with her sister or whatever, I just really . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: So it really is, then, in some ways more about protecting your mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: My mom. Me. I\u2019m happy to leave. I don\u2019t want to go there to this depressing building with a psychotic aunt. I get it. It\u2019s sad. I\u2019ve absorbed all that. I\u2019ve seen the woman every single day at our house. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see what happens by Tuesday. I almost feel like in seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">her again, I would be doing it for others. My grandmother is not going to remember if I saw her or not and I\u2019m not going to do it for my mom.  My conscious is \u2013 I don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019ve seen her every day. I don\u2019t see her \u2013 for what? I can\u2019t have a conversation. She doesn\u2019t understand. Like I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">I just don\u2019t want it to unravel into something else. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done with all this shit. I might write her a note.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Because those are words. Those are things that, at some point when my mom sees her, she can just read her these words. And it still won\u2019t matter. My grandma will be like \u201cHow is the boy? Did he finish school?\u201d or whatever, and then she\u2019ll forget; but I will have said a couple of words, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">is purely selfish. It\u2019s not going to mean anything to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855938\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: It would do something for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: Or no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: It kind of won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: That was the question about going to see her one last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t really thought about it, but no emotions welled up. I wasn\u2019t like, \u201cIf I don\u2019t see her and something happens . . .\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It did when you were here yesterday, remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: It did. But then the more thought I gave it, it\u2019s like that\u2019s just what? I think it\u2019s already welled up because I\u2019ve already said goodbye to her in my mind. So just thinking of it that way, yeah, that\u2019s really sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST:  (inaudible at 00:19:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I just feel like I\u2019ve made my peace. That\u2019s not the grandmother I\u2019ve had. I love her, but \u2013 if it were something where I didn\u2019t see her so often, I would go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: It wouldn\u2019t feel like a missed opportunity, then, if she passes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Not at all. Not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s the question you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Again, because I have taken the brunt of all this shit. So seeing her one last time for some symbolic thing just to make myself feel better . . . (pause) I don\u2019t know. I think in that way, I\u2019m a big fan of this Anglo-Saxon thing. There is a time and place for certain kinds of goodbyes. I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">a big goodbye person. Not that you should be not emotional, but the ritual of making a big goodbye out of things, I don\u2019t like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Do you know why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Because oftentimes I\u2019m not feeling it in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: In that moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I feel like I have to do it. Because I notice it with my Assyrian friends. When George\u2019s brother left the last night, I was one of the only people that hugged him. It was like all right,] (ph?) see you, man.\u201d I thought that was kind of cool because yeah, he\u2019s going to be back four <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">months from now. There is something that I like in that level of \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to describe it. It\u2019s almost comforting. It\u2019s almost confident. Yeah, I\u2019ll see you in four months. We don\u2019t have to make a big thing here. I don\u2019t know. I like that. There is something about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Whereas the big thing feels like being anxious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like it\u2019s just becoming a big deal.  \u201cOh, we\u2019re going . . .\u201d Yes, it\u2019s kind of sad, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: So back to the melodrama?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. I feel like a lot of times it gets a little melodramatic, and that\u2019s not me. I can have those moments by myself maybe, but it just kind of annoys me. Not annoys me, but I just don\u2019t feel it in the moment, so a lot of times I just feel more uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Especially if you\u2019ve been surrounded by emotional melodrama, Brian. [Your experience, then, with emotion is that it comes at you so quickly that it\u2019s intrusive. It doesn\u2019t have to be nice.] (ph?) It\u2019s not joyful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, not like \u201cI\u2019m really going to miss you.\u201d It\u2019s like (mimicking crying). Ugh. Fuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: As though it\u2019s a bad thing. I was thinking about it, the way you enacted it it\u2019s like a bad thing is happening instead of adding to the joy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s about them, right? If it\u2019s about your own neuroses and your own things, then Claire could be winning the Nobel Prize, but (mimicking crying) \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get to Sweden and oh, my God. It\u2019s going to be fucking cold. Be careful. People are going to know you and they\u2019re going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">want things from you because you won a Nobel Prize. You\u2019re going to have 5,000 . . . \u201c They would just take that and just fucking go. \u201cPut that money somewhere. Be very careful. People are very . . .

She even said, not just her, but her sister and a bunch of them have these things now. This is relatively new. \u201cWhere very you go, be careful with your drinks. Don\u2019t put your drink down and take your eye off of it.\u201d What the fuck? What are we, like in medieval England?  I\u2019m worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">about . . . If I was like a 20-year-old girl, I guess maybe, but I think I\u2019ll be okay. My God. Jesus Christ. I can laugh at that when I\u2019m not . . . Just like everybody, right? All my friends, or a lot of my friends, have some kind of something with one or both of their parents that really annoys them <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A52\">and this and that. But they tell me about it and then they can move on because . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, they\u2019re separate. There is a physical separateness. Just like when I was in London, my conversations with my mom are totally different. \u201cI love you, mom. How\u2019s it going?\u201d There were very few moments when it would get annoying because I could just go. I don\u2019t have to get into it with her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom. The water is boiling.\u201d It changes everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Even if I\u2019m chuckling about these examples, when you\u2019re a child and this is all you know, it\u2019s devastating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s fucking brutal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Every positive thing that happens to you immediately has negative aspects to it that get focused on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yep. Yeah. Which then I project. Yeah. Good times. (scoffs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I could feel tears welling up on Wednesday that I was not hesitant to show you too much in our session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: You did? You did! I knew it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I thought you saw. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Oh, come on, man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: It was so much more about pride almost. I was exhilarated for you.

That\u2019s very sweet. I did notice that, but I was like no way. That\u2019s not possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: (chuckling) Why not? Why not possible? Because I\u2019m not allowed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Not possible. Gloss over that. You know what it is, too? I think I\u2019m relishing this feeling of not feeling that way. Finally, I\u2019m being myself. I\u2019m not pretending to be stoic. I\u2019m just psyched to get the fuck out of here; and I\u2019m sad, but I\u2019m going to e-mail you on my way out. Whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">It just feels like this has been \u2013 I won\u2019t say a long time coming, but it\u2019s time.  I\u2019m already kind of checked out. For once that feels good that I\u2019m not like (mimicking crying). Like today I\u2019m going to see all my friends at the club. You\u2019re more than welcome to come if you want to have a cry at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C12\">bar. The last time I did this to go to London, at the end of the night I suddenly got emotional. It\u2019s just not going to happen. I\u2019m not feeling it. (chuckles) I\u2019m going to have a great night and have a blast, have a lot of fun, take pictures, and then I\u2019m going to see these fuckers again in whatever months.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855938\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Even when you say \u201cbecause I\u2019m not feeling that\u201d it didn\u2019t feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It didn\u2019t feel bad, the tears, it felt joyful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: For you? No, I don\u2019t mean you. My normal friends, like you, that\u2019s very sweet.  What I\u2019m saying is that it feels good that I feel that, too. It just feels good that I\u2019m not . . . I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I just feel supremely comfortable in going and I feel no amped-up emotions about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">it. I feel amped-up emotions, but my thoughts are already there, like the people I\u2019m going to meet, things I\u2019m going to do, fucking writing shit and kicking ass \u2013 whatever the fuck. Having days where I\u2019m lonely and whatever. I\u2019m already bracing myself for my daily life there. This all, to me, feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C92\">like it\u2019s about fucking time. (chuckles) I\u2019ve worked my ass off here. My family \u2013 Lord knows I\u2019ve had enough of that shit. I\u2019ve talked about my non-Assyrian friends who I love, but I\u2019ll see them when I see them. It\u2019s great.  And my Assyrian friends, I\u2019m really going to miss, just like I\u2019m going to miss <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C93\">you here, but I\u2019m going to see them pretty soon. They\u2019re going to come there and I\u2019m going to come here which, if I had known this when I went to London, I think a lot of things would have gone differently. I fucking came back six months later or something, so what was that all about? I couldn\u2019t compute <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C94\">that. Yes, it is sad, but it\u2019s really exciting and awesome and I\u2019ll come back and they\u2019ll come visit me. This just feels so supremely healthy for the first time ever that I\u2019m just kind of like coasting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re just ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And that has trumped anything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: It kind of is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: In your eyes it doesn\u2019t touch your being ready and absolutely being the right thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Whereas with your mother, it does. Her focus becomes so anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: She goes back and forth. That\u2019s the part I do give her credit for, but it\u2019s just like a see-saw. One day she\u2019s so excited and joking with the cat. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to go to this place in Assyria and you\u2019re going to go to that place. You\u2019re going to be the prettiest cat in Assyria. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">Too bad you can\u2019t have babies. You\u2019d have Assyria cat babies.\u201d Other days it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know what to say. May God be with you.\u201d (both chuckle) It\u2019s just fucking . . . whew. And I\u2019m like, \u201cMom, I\u2019ll be back soon. You\u2019ll come and visit this summer.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t have money.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D92\">It\u2019s like well, we\u2019ll figure it out.  It\u2019s not some dark, medieval melodrama or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s nothing dark happening. Nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that part of me is so done with all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: And even if it\u2019s an Assyrian monastery three weeks from now that you get tears in your eyes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to still feel dark.

It\u2019s going to be joyful and I\u2019ll welcome that. I hope that things like that are going to happen. I have no doubt that they will, just like I have no doubt that I can be sitting at the airport waiting for the flight and be like \u201cOh, wow. This is kind of weird. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">kind of sad,\u201d but then I\u2019m not. (laughs) I\u2019m going to order a coffee and look at my little kitty cat. It\u2019s fucking awesome.  It\u2019s just not . . . (long pause) I think, at the end, these things are all about people\u2019s egos. That\u2019s the thing. Whatever flaws my dad had, his side of the family had a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">humility and I think that\u2019s the problem. People don\u2019t have enough humility to just fucking chill the fuck out and just let people be.  That\u2019s a fucking gift. You can\u2019t just make yourself be \u2013 you can. It\u2019s a lot of fucking work that most people \u2013 why would they do that? Look at this. It\u2019s fucking hard. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E13\">But I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s really not rocket science. It\u2019s what it is. People are just so wrapped up in their own . . . and it\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s just hard to think outside of that.

I just fucking cranked and I think it\u2019s going to sound pretty fucking amazing. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m just done. That stuff is coming out now. It\u2019s almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E52\">like there is no time for . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: There is just so much to get to and get cracking on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yes. Exactly. Exactly.  (long pause) It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019ll think about it and I have to double-check. It\u2019s hard to explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Double-check?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: It will be like man, am I fooling myself? It\u2019s just so new and so consistent. It\u2019s like wait a second. (laughs) But it is. No, wait. I should feel sad. I just don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Why should you feel sad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: Not sad; this is all new. I\u2019ve just never felt this way. It\u2019s very simple. I\u2019m just excited to go and do the shit I\u2019m going to do, so it\u2019s the first time there is nothing else around that thought. It\u2019s not wrapped up in a cluster fuck of \u201cI suck; I\u2019m a fake; no one gives a shit.\u201d I don\u2019t feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">any of that. \u201cI\u2019m going to get there and none of those girls are going to like me.\u201d I don\u2019t give a shit. There are things I\u2019ve got to get done that are going to get fucking done.  I\u2019ve never, ever felt this way. I already know that at the airport, I would like nothing more than to get there at night, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F12\">really early. I\u2019m going to crank up that laptop, put the kitty cat down, and I\u2019m going to write. I\u2019m just going to keep doing what I\u2019ve been doing every day. That\u2019s just pretty awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really exciting. [In some ways, your writing, which should have been all along, instead of the \u201cshould\u201d being that shouldn\u2019t feel anxious.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: In some ways, it\u2019s reconnecting to a much better version of that teenage self, where I was constantly like that, but not because I was shy and there was all this criticism and this or that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Reconnecting the really talented and motivated parts of you, yet in a more confident . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: And like you said, in a real, connected-to-the-world way, not in some weird bubble where I think I\u2019m going to win a Pulitzer prize or something. I\u2019m just a dude doing my thing and I\u2019m pretty good at it, so whatever happens with that, happens. (pause)  Am I allowed to write about this? I am allowed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F91\">to write about this stuff. Is there something about your therapist? I would never use your name, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855938\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not allowed to write about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: At least by name, unless I have permission from you or something. You can say whatever you want to say. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: Oh, really? Cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What were you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s creeping into things I\u2019m writing. I\u2019m realizing this blog, I think, is going to be come partly the seeds of what would be a memoir-type, having to do with PTSD, trauma and that other thing you said \u2013 disassociative . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: Disassociating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like everything I\u2019m writing about, it\u2019s slipping in.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. This has become a part of your experience, your internal world. (inaudible at 00:40:16) That required opening yourself up, being brave enough to be here three times a week. You didn\u2019t know what you were signing up for or what it would do or wouldn\u2019t do. Would it suck you in or <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">make you further enveloped by your mother? Like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m proud of it, for sure. That\u2019s something that I now feel fine saying. In the past it would be like \u201coh, yeah; whatever.\u201d Now I\u2019m like no, not whatever. I worked my fucking ass off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Where you used to even see it as a kind of negative clich\u00e9 like the elite people do or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: You should hear me. I\u2019m such a champion. There are two things. It\u2019s like anything else. It\u2019s like a relationship. Of course, most relationships suck. So yeah, you go from therapist to therapist and they all suck. But if you\u2019re committed to improving yourself or whatever it is about you, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201111\">you just don\u2019t give up. And when you find that right therapist, you\u2019ll just fucking know it. But then you\u2019ve got to work even harder. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re just going to do a rain dance around you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s just the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">CLIENT: I tell people all the time. They\u2019ll be like, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. I gave up trying.\u201d I\u2019m a huge, huge proponent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: And you have worked really, really hard at something that most people don\u2019t ever dare facing. It\u2019s much easier to not do this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the gym.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">THERAPIST: And I think it\u2019s paid off. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: Hell yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">THERAPIST: And you (inaudible at 00:42:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s the thing. One day when I\u2019m back visiting or whatever, it\u2019s a whole new kind of . . . That\u2019s kind of exciting. That\u2019s exciting, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: Well you know I\u2019ll be here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">THERAPIST: Touch base on it. (inaudible at 00:42:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">CLIENT: No, I will. I\u2019ll e-mail you probably the minute I get there. Definitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I would love to hear about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">CLIENT: Of course. I don\u2019t know what the Skype situation is. I think I would rather feel, at first, like I can chip in and make a dent into what I owe, but I think that will be cool. It\u2019s so much easier now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019ll see how you feel once you get there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">THERAPIST: Even if you wanted to touch base once, but not as a regular thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">CLIENT: It might be like that. It might be like that, but I think it would be nice. All right. Claire thank you so much for everything. Thank you very much.
