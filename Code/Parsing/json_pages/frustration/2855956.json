Wasn\u2019t available that day, I think, and (inaudible). The thing gets stuck in your head because it\u2019s all parodies of popular songs. You\u2019ve got Robin Thicke\u2019s date rape song. Forget what it\u2019s called.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Blurred Lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Exactly. It\u2019s called \u201cWord Crimes\u201d, goes through a variety of grammar mistakes, and is pretty much like, you\u2019ve got to stop doing this. It\u2019s great. His first one was Pharrell\u2019s Happy one, (inaudible) Tacky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Tacky?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Tacky, (inaudible), if it\u2019s okay with you, you\u2019d be tacky too. The last one yesterday was Foil, about Lorde\u2019s Royals song. It\u2019s about aluminum foil.  Then it changes direction halfway through. A friend of mine is like, \u201cI almost didn\u2019t watch the whole thing, then hit the middle of it and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">entire thing changed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Can you get them on YouTube?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, it\u2019s all through YouTube, but the first (inaudible) has one, and Vevo has one. He\u2019s spreading them around to various Internet sites and also on YouTube. But it\u2019s sort of a spread around the love sort of thing. Anyway, really funny stuff. Threw in some porn the other day. Not as difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">as I thought it would be, also not as easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: You did what though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Loaded some porn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Loaded some porn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: One of the things that, this woman made $10,000.00 off of one month\u2019s of work. She wrote 100 books, 110,000 page books in a series of erotic literature, self-published on Amazon for probably about $2.99.  She just paid attention to what people were buying, which books were popular, which books <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">weren\u2019t popular. She\u2019s like, these are the formulas. Use the scenarios (inaudible), take those scenarios and write about them repeatedly, and she did. It was good. She was like, \u201cI was trying to write horror novels.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t getting anywhere. She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ll just write porn for a month.\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">it worked out. I fucking love to write porn, and I\u2019m thinking about a semi-sci-fi series, like Firefly was sci-fi. It\u2019s far future enough that there\u2019s space ships and shit, but you know\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a TV show, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like a western in space, the way Star Trek was supposed to be with \u2013 everyone\u2019s got ships, but they\u2019re not amazing ships. People who have weapons are probably firing at the grounds. Some people are firing at revolts, but that\u2019s the military and stuff like that. Anyway, anything in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">low sci-fi setting. If you can gloss over things, you can (inaudible) dropping a line about (inaudible), because there\u2019s aliens in one of the styles. (inaudible). That\u2019s what we\u2019re (inaudible), and a 10,000 page book, I\u2019m not particularly worried about that, but it\u2019s really getting into how long did <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">it take them to get from point A to point B. What they do want to see, the women, are character stories, character arcs. They want to care about the people who are fucking, much like me, actually.  My porn, I want scenario based stuff, or why are they here? I want to know why these people are involved in this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">We joke about \u2013 in college we had this friend of ours named CG, he was a dude, and he had this really shitty porn tape, and they were mostly shitty porn tapes. It was all VHS back then. It was called Six Guys, a Girl, and a Couch, and he was like, Six Guys, a Girl, and CG was like his \u2013 we joked that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">it was more dudes than it was women, because it was. It was a gang bang, one woman, six guys, clearly on a couch. But one time I was like, thanks, I\u2019ll borrow this. I put it in, and it just starts out in a pretty much empty apartment with a couch. It was a place they probably rented for the day, hasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">been painted yet, who knows, and then the man and woman are naked on the couch, fucking.  She\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God. Oh yeah.\u201d That level of intensity, I\u2019m not even doing a parody of her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855956\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">It\u2019s the actual thing. So they\u2019re doing that for a little while, then these other five guys walk in who apparently were like contractors in the other apartment next door that heard some noise or whatever. It was the supposed thing, because a bunch of them had overalls that are coming off in different <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">stages, and one has a paint roller, but he\u2019s naked. Some of the guys are just naked. It\u2019s like, how did this even \u2013 what do you mean? You\u2019re all naked. If you\u2019re working next door, how did this happen? How did any of this \u2013 this sucks.  Six Guys, a Girl, and a Couch. Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">cares? There\u2019s so much porn, so much porn available in the world, for free, from reputable sites, so why not make a good porn, right? This is what I started doing. I\u2019m experimenting with a slash fic, pre-established characters, because those are a good way to get your feet wet. One of the reasons women <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">write slash fic is because they already know the characters from the television shows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: What is it called?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Slash fic is when you take fan fic, and you take usually two male characters and make them a couple. So there\u2019s a lot of slash fic going on with Sherlock. There\u2019s a lot of slash fic about Supernatural, all sorts of shows. Any shows with rugged dudes, there\u2019s slash fic about them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Oh is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wrote\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s John of\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: John Watson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So it won\u2019t be from two different shows, necessarily?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Sometimes, but whatever. So I was like, I\u2019ll just write something funny. I\u2019ll write some basic gay sex stuff, really basic, nothing explicit, get my feet wet essentially, because women prefer men on men sex. It\u2019s the most popular thing in when it comes to the female (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just written word?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: All written.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: All written word and you just\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I took the character, Eric Northman, from True Blood, who is a vampire, very popular vampire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Which guy? I have seen the show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: He\u2019s like \u2013 have you seen the first season?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: He\u2019s the sheriff. He has the long hair. He\u2019s (inaudible) fantasia. He\u2019s the first guy you meet with any vampire authority.  (inaudible). Anyway, very popular character, the kind of guy who shows up in just gym shorts sometimes, just high enough to hide his pubes, but other than that, (inaudible). <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">So it was like, okay, that\u2019s good, but people love Sherlock slash, and people love Dr. Who slash. I was like, I\u2019ve been pissed off for quite a while that Steven Moffat was still running Sherlock, BBC, and Dr. Who. You can\u2019t give \u2013 like Sherlock is amazing, and he\u2019s letting the doctor kind of wander, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">not really trying satisfying story arc stuff, where he\u2019s doing these amazing short films. I was like, I would like him to focus on Sherlock and give Dr. Who a different show runner.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855956\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Oh, he\u2019s the show runner for both?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I started a fic about that, about him waking up in bed next to Sherlock, (inaudible) a bit of erotic movement, and then he gets up to go to \u2013 Steven Moffat gets up to go to the bathroom, and (inaudible), and he gets up to go to the bathroom, and the Doctor surprises him, and they have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">some sex in the hot tub, and then afterwards the Doctor\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d  He\u2019s like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair. You\u2019re splitting your attention between us. He needs you specifically, and you do all these other things. He could very easily be a horrible human being, so we need you working on that.\u201d He\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">like, \u201cI know. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not fair to him. It\u2019s not fair to me, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d So I have them go off, and it\u2019s a tender thing, and that\u2019s what the women tell me, \u201cOh, he\u2019s so tender.\u201d Oh good. Okay. That\u2019s good. You like tender.  You\u2019ll read tender and touch yourself, and that\u2019s all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200513\">I\u2019m into now. But this woman writes porn. So I\u2019m like, okay, I\u2019ll write something more specific. So I wrote Eric Northman having sex with some random woman, but I wrote it all from her perspective as an exercise. I\u2019ve read a number of sex scenes written from a female perspective, and I was like, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200514\">I think I know some themes I can use, some language that seems appealing, and it\u2019s more about how the expression of it \u2013 it\u2019s more about emotional aspects of what\u2019s happening, the intellectual aspects of what\u2019s happening. Yeah, there\u2019s totally sex, and it gets explicit eventually, but not super explicit, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200515\">not like watching XXX rated porn, more like watching NC17, like they made this in Europe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: So I started looking on Amazon to see what sells, and the most popular erotic fiction out there is master\/slave stuff, dom stuff. I could write dom stuff probably. I wouldn\u2019t want to write it pretending that (inaudible). I mean, I (inaudible). It\u2019s been getting a few hits and people are pleased with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Here\u2019s a package. Someone bought GTA for the DS and (inaudible). So (pause) I\u2019m (inaudible).  It\u2019s good. People like a sex scene that I wrote from a woman\u2019s perspective, from a mostly female audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s good. The fantasies that I write is young adult, feminist, female characters. I\u2019ve only really shown it to women, and they all eat it up, and there\u2019s not even any sex in that. I\u2019ve added some illusions to that. It\u2019s young adult, something like we all meet back in my room, blah, blah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">blah, something like that, stuff that\u2019s eluded to people having sexual relations, but we\u2019re not here to be explicit. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s not about who they\u2019re sleeping with, but they\u2019re humans, so they\u2019re sleeping with people. It\u2019s not about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re writing, do you have an audience in mind that you\u2019re writing to? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, young adult women.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855956\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Do you imagine what they might\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: What they\u2019re missing right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: What are you imagining, like how they might read it, or like what the intended effect is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: The effect is (inaudible). There\u2019s violence and violence is graphically depicted, but it\u2019s violence on an equal scale. It\u2019s humans, or monsters and humans fighting, and the gender of the people doesn\u2019t come into play when they\u2019re fighting. In a perfect fantasy world where feminism, where sexism <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">and racism don\u2019t exist. So I don\u2019t have to deal with those issues. I can just write them (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Women are as capable of violence as\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, and because they are. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve fought a woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Of course I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: I mean physically fought a woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: No, but of course they\u2019re (inaudible). It\u2019s like the high school, a lot of girls fighting in high school, a lot of violence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: If there\u2019s a pack, it can be incredible. One on one though, still, they\u2019re like me. They don\u2019t care all of the sudden. As one woman just wrote in an article I read recently, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not going to assume you\u2019re just regular Joe and not a rapist if I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">you. That\u2019s not safe.\u201d It\u2019s assumed (inaudible). She said, so yeah, if I see you, and you\u2019re a man, and I\u2019m by myself, I\u2019m going to be aware of who you are and if you\u2019re watching me, if you\u2019re a rapist. But they don\u2019t care when they\u2019re fighting, (inaudible).  (pause) The worst ones relish it. They want <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">to hurt you. This exists on the male side as well. They want to hurt you when they fight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: But you were sort of saying there\u2019s no sexism when it comes to violence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: And there is. There\u2019s Aaron, a Russian who fucking hates women, doesn\u2019t think they should be in combat as well, so he just gets harder on them. Well no, he goes hard, which is why I love that character. Aaron\u2019s like, \u201cLet\u2019s kill (inaudible). That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I learn so much from you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">how easy it is for you to take out my eye.\u201d Anyway, (inaudible) level of competency they\u2019re at. He doesn\u2019t follow the rule of building partners up. He\u2019s like, you\u2019re standing or you\u2019re not. You can stop me from killing you, or you can\u2019t.  But I like the fighting (inaudible). That\u2019s all I want to play. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200792\">But not everyone does. It\u2019s equalized. I do have one scene where one dude almost kills all three of them, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s a dude, but it\u2019s because he\u2019s better. He\u2019s more experienced, more talented, more trained. They\u2019re not in great shape when he gets to them, so he\u2019s able to take them on one at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">Then the wizard shows up and just destroys them. That\u2019s the first time you see her do what she\u2019s capable of, but it\u2019s great. I have this bit where \u2013 the collective (inaudible), that\u2019s the human, rather than people. Not everyone\u2019s technically human, but the races that meet in the wild that are capable <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">of compassion, empathy, and cooperation to things outside of their own species, can be called a person, essentially.  You\u2019re a person. Now you can be part of the collective. As we expand we won\u2019t wipe out your race. We\u2019ll incorporate you. As the collective goes we\u2019ll all find ways to contribute, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">that\u2019s (inaudible). But there\u2019s a bit there where he\u2019s fighting these people, and one of the characters pauses (inaudible) and gets into discussions because it\u2019s a typical (inaudible) thing. But this official declaration she goes through, like an officer of the military, where she revokes the person <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B3\">under the authority of the collective.  He is now a monster, which the psychopaths are. The psychopaths are monsters. That\u2019s how they deal with psychopaths. They don\u2019t have a word for psychopaths. People just (inaudible) and revoke.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855956\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Is this all the young adult?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: The young adult fantasy stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to talk to this audience about\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: It is. It\u2019s about who you are in relation to your power. That\u2019s what these stories are about. Each woman has a different way of experiencing who they are in relation to their power. This one is born into it, and embraced it, and understood that as a duty. She\u2019s like, I am capable of doing these <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">things, in the service of the collective, and therefore that\u2019s what I do. In fact all of them have that part, but this one was born that way. She\u2019s not technically human. She\u2019s got abilities people don\u2019t.  Taylor took her power. She earned it, but then accepted it and took it, but begrudgingly to a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">degree, like, yeah, yeah, yeah. She has a connection to a divine being which she\u2019s able to act (inaudible). (inaudible). We\u2019re equals, you and I. Kayla stands on equal footing with the source of her power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">Sarah is the most powerful of all three of them, but is the artist, and never wanted to become \u2013 in fact her strength is what stopped her from being able to follow her dreams. Because she was so strong, they\u2019re like, no, sorry. In the service of the collective, we have to give you a weapon. You\u2019re too <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">strong for us to waste you on building enchanted sewer pipes and stuff.  We need you on the front lines, so that\u2019s where you\u2019re going. I have this flashback scene for a while before she meets the other two characters where she is in the weapon trance, which is what I\u2019m describing as the way I go and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200852\">I fight. I no longer think of you as a human, and everything is where is your hands, where are their hands? (inaudible). It\u2019s quick, it\u2019s fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">So that\u2019s what I write her as doing in that state, then there\u2019s this flashback state of where she was just deployed to essentially this war of this race that was discovered, and it\u2019s a scene of her standing on a hilltop, motionless, except for casting horrible, awful spells, and calculating, \u201cIt\u2019s more <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">efficient if I wound or maim them, so I\u2019ll shoot his leg off from here, and burn off half of his face, and that will cause terror in people around him who survive. Maiming is more effective psychologically.\u201d  She\u2019s going through all of that as a machine. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I want to show that it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">a thing she has to do, because she can do it, and of course she has to do it, and she hates it. That\u2019s what the weapon state is for, so she doesn\u2019t have to feel it, but she does afterwards. There\u2019s always afterwards. I don\u2019t know how I deal with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">How do you deal with PTSD of a person who\u2019s never had to experience the ravages of war until after they happen? I don\u2019t know how that looks like. She writes novels. She has novels she\u2019s writing. There\u2019s a (inaudible). Writing a novel.  Also because novels that have stuff that goes on, on a frontier <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">sell really well. People watch (inaudible). She\u2019s writing a book where (inaudible) fantasy fulfillment thing where she\u2019s really popular. This character she makes, Tara, has lots of friends, very popular, (inaudible). She\u2019s very poorly socialized. So it\u2019s almost this kind of na\u00efve idea of this and this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200892\">Then the second part of the series after Kayla moves on to another part of the world, the captain comes to her to replace the (inaudible) and other soldiers. His name is Gavin, looks like the guy in the book, and she\u2019s about to freak out, and blush, and be all sweet when she meets him. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855956\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">She\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t do that, because I\u2019ll look like an idiot.\u201d So she drops into a weapon state immediately. I think I told you this. There\u2019s this part where there\u2019s a conflict between them of \u2013 he\u2019s technically in charge even though she\u2019s far more powerful, but she was deemed unfit for command <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">because of her emotional distress about making these choices. You\u2019re the weapon someone else is aiming, essentially. There was this complication scene where it puts him in front of all these dudes, and he\u2019s trying to get her to stand down, and he wants to send people after (inaudible).  Because they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B2\">not allowed to do that. You\u2019re not allowed to just take off into the wild. There\u2019s power to remain there, and the only reason you would want that is for selfish reasons. So you need to stay here and help us all get it or you\u2019re not one of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">So of course (inaudible) happens and it\u2019s the face off where he eventually orders her to stand down, at which point she raises this (inaudible) to separate the two of them. This is after they\u2019ve been debating for some time. (inaudible). She\u2019s like, \u201cHow dare you? Now I have to do this.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">cannot let you go.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYou try to order me.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t order me. There is no way you can stop me from going.\u201d  So he\u2019s trying to lower these walls, (inaudible) wizard, and you\u2019re going to kneel down. This is over now. For that reason, the whole point of I\u2019ve introduced power <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D2\">into this. (inaudible) we were never equal. We will never be equal. This is not salvaging. I have another one where she first understands the mistakes in training, and the guy who trains her is a total asshole, and he gets her and abuses her, and other wizards let this happen because he has the best <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D3\">weapons. He\u2019s not a good person, but he makes the most effective weapons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">Anyway, he\u2019s been trying to force her into weapons (inaudible).  You take all the emotional parts and compartmentalize them and turn them off for a period of time. (inaudible). Your mind is focused on the math of what\u2019s happening. So she has this bit where she\u2019s running scared, and it\u2019s your final exam, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">and you\u2019re going to pass or I\u2019m going to (inaudible). She knows he\u2019s aiming to cripple her, that if she fails she\u2019s going to be crippled, because he hates her, and she hates him too, and she\u2019s running, and trying to avoid these things and defend herself, and she\u2019s on the defensive, and (inaudible). <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F2\">She\u2019s not as strong as him. She\u2019ll get tired before he does the whole thing. So she\u2019s like, \u201cI have to be smarter somehow.\u201d She\u2019s running, but she\u2019s not afraid anymore. She hasn\u2019t felt clouds of emotions in a long time because there\u2019s been no source for that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855956\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">She\u2019s thinking of how much she hates him, and the only thing she has left right now is this hatred, at which point she\u2019s like, \u201cThe only thing I have left is hatred, and at which point she\u2019s able to (inaudible) and understand it, and put it in a box.\u201d So then she becomes the weapon. She starts kicking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200911\">his ass. It\u2019s completely this dispassionate stuff. She\u2019s like, what\u2019s the most efficient thing to do? Boom. He\u2019s casting fire, so I\u2019ll create a sheet of ice. I bed I could modify it on the fly so that (inaudible) falls back and his hand freezes as ice, solid. This spell shatters metal but it should <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200912\">shatter ice too. Boom. His hand explodes in frozen bloody chunks, drops to the grand, target is (inaudible). She throws a shitload of spells at his chest.  He tries to put a shield up but one of his hands is gone. He gets slammed up against the wall to the point where she\u2019s about to kill him, when another <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200913\">wizard tackles her, and she\u2019s like, okay, snap out of it. You did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">She looks over and sees this guy with a bloody stump, and other guys burning it to cauterize it. She\u2019s like, what do I do? Oh my gosh. I\u2019m so sorry. The wizard\u2019s like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not sorry. You did well. You did the right thing today.\u201d Her heart just fucking breaks at that point. You maimed this person <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">forever. That was the right thing to do and I\u2019m proud of it. It\u2019s just the \u2013 yeah. But from that point in the book, she gets a different teacher, one who is like, \u201cSorry you had to go through all of that.\u201d  But one who understands. He\u2019s like, \u201cI know how horrible it is. I get it. I\u2019ve come out of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200932\">weapon state having done horrible things.\u201d He teaches her how to live with it. But again, there\u2019s a scene where it finally clicks for Kayla. Kayla doesn\u2019t like Sarah because Sarah\u2019s bubbly, and happy, and talkative, and kind of clingy, because she\u2019s like, \u201cOh wow, friends. I have friends for the first <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200933\">time.\u201d Kayla doesn\u2019t really like her that much. So one day she realizes.

I\u2019m paying attention <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF2\">to you right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">THERAPIST: And you wanted that (inaudible). You sought the study of it. You were seeking out the knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: It always mystifies me. The joke is, the man can\u2019t find the clitoris. I\u2019m like, how can you not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Just look it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: (laughter) Exactly. How do you not find the clitoris, even by touch, in the dark, by touch? Once you figure out where you are, and once she\u2019s all turned on, it\u2019s very easy. Then (inaudible) west, straight up from here, ah, there you go, found it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But you looked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, the clitoral hood, and exposing the clitoris, it\u2019s like the whole thing, and just how much motions. Women need repetitive motions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">CLIENT: Men can orgasm from a variety of shifting speeds or whatever, and we tend to benefit from that, more variation, whereas women actually \u2013 giving a woman a handjob or that sort of thing, versus going down, whatever it is, you find the pattern that\u2019s right, and you stick with that pattern and repeat <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF1\">it, and that\u2019s how you make a woman come every single time, and quickly. This, this, this, there we go. Boom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re looking for a woman to respond too, to please her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the only interesting part of it. I\u2019m going to come. Doesn\u2019t fucking matter. That\u2019s easy for me.  I know I\u2019m going to get mine. That\u2019s not difficult, right? Women are the puzzle. It\u2019s different. You have to bring them alive. You really have to turn them on. (inaudible). We\u2019re both here <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D31\">to get laid. We\u2019re both turned on now. Let\u2019s just go and fuck. But so I read about this stuff, and Ginny\u2019s like, that was really good. Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You showed her \u2013 which one did you show her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: Both. They\u2019re published under the (inaudible) archive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: What was it like to show her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I was just thinking I hope it\u2019s not shitty, and I hope it\u2019s not like, \u201cYou went too far in this direction.\u201d  Essentially I\u2019m like how graphic, how explicit am I supposed to be? It\u2019s really borderline. She\u2019s like, \u201cYou see the word cock a few times usually in these stories, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB1\">see pussy, in terms of the words, but there\u2019s more of a key to how she gets wet. That\u2019s the stuff.\u201d I\u2019m like, okay, I can write that sort of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Did she find it erotic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: I believe so. She said it was really hot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Oh, she did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: So yeah, but I pulled the (inaudible) of contacts, which they all dropped, which is (inaudible), salesman, who I worked with on (inaudible), who was my counterpart when I was trying to sell my services, but as a true salesman from the South, he didn\u2019t (inaudible) containing a relationship with <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E71\">me.  He would call me. We would talk for hours at a time. He never talked about (inaudible). His wife, and his dog, and my dog, and my wife, and shooting ranges, and that\u2019s fun, and that other stuff, and experience in the industry. He\u2019s a good guy, I like the guy, and clearly a salesman, but not a skeezy <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E72\">salesman, but quick and bright, and sees opportunity, he\u2019ll seize it, and if he knows what you want to hear, he\u2019ll code shift into that version of a person.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855956\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">So I like him and I respect him, but he\u2019s also a salesman. But he works at (inaudible) as a salesman. He sells services. He knows the QA director because he sells QA services.  He has something to gain if I become a QA manager. This is (inaudible). He\u2019s a salesman who has something to gain from me being <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E91\">hired. He\u2019s like, \u201cSend me your resume today. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to call in 48 hours.\u201d I\u2019m like, I know you\u2019ve got (inaudible). Let\u2019s talk about it. He said, \u201cWhat things?\u201d (inaudible). Have you looked at this? He\u2019s a (inaudible). He\u2019s going to be like, \u201cI\u2019m relocating you from across <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E92\">the country.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, got kids? Great. He doesn\u2019t have kids, just a wife and two dogs. You don\u2019t have to pay him a lot of money to get him out of here. You get a number, he makes you an offer, there\u2019s no state income tax out here. It\u2019s basically a 10 percent increase on whatever he offers.\u201d I\u2019m like, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB1\">thanks. He\u2019s like, \u201cLet\u2019s say for instance, $100,000.00, ballpark figure. $110,000.00, $112,000.00.\u201d  I\u2019m like, okay. Thank you for all that information. He\u2019s setting me up to accept an offer. He\u2019s being like a fucking realtor here. I get what (inaudible). I have a sympathetic ear for my services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I see what you\u2019re saying, because (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">CLIENT: And I can get you in there by letting you know what the range is, what you can be expecting for compensation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure that happens all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s what is known to people, but again, he is the one who has something to gain, so he\u2019s the last one I called. Some people would be like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call that guy first?\u201d Again, why would you move that trunk? Well because this offer is the best kind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. That way the other options would be you don\u2019t owe anybody anything and there\u2019s no kind of quid pro quo. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (crosstalk) It\u2019s not like he owes me, but it\u2019s clearly we worked together in the past and it\u2019s going to be advantageous for you to have me there talking to them about how much data services (inaudible), and that will be easy for me because I think Babel is the best, and a little more expensive, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F71\">but for the best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure people do that all the time.

Usually they want $30.00 to $40.00 for <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F1\">a tester hour, which is wicked expensive. I got them down to $25.00. I got these other offers out there. I said, Ed, here\u2019s the problem. They\u2019re not as good as you are, right? But I can\u2019t sell you guys unless you come down another five percent, whatever it was.
