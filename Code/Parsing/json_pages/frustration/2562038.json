It bothers me.\u201d I don\u2019t know, she was just saying, \u201cOh, I\u2019m just trying to be nice.\u201d And, \u201cBecause I know I can have a,\u201d she said, \u201cBecause I know I can have a harsh tone,\u201d or whatever. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">know. I was just all, \u201cIt seems extremely unnatural. And I feel like you\u2019re trying to manipulate me,\u201d or whatever.

I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Everything she did just annoyed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">me or whatever. And so I\u2019m not really sure why, but . . . I don\u2019t know. I think it was just her trying to . . . avoid or forget things that need to be dealt with or I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t know. She just is going about her business, la-di-da, and\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So, yeah, I mean, and then, so, on the phone, I don\u2019t know, she just\u2014and I told her this when I left Boise. I was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t deal with your problems. There\u2019s something (inaudible at 00:04:43), there\u2019s so much tension and anxiety in this house.\u201d I don\u2019t know.

So, talking on the phone, she\u2019s just like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just trying to better or trying to change.\u201d I don\u2019t know. She just says all these like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not smart,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m not (inaudible at 00:05:22).\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I don\u2019t know. \u201c(inaudible at 00:05:26), my children hate me,\u201d and all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">other things.

I just want, I don\u2019t know, things to get better and I don\u2019t know exactly how or why I\u2019m so angry at you. I just feel like you\u2019re not dealing with these things well.\u201d I don\u2019t know. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">makes me so frustrated, but\u2014I don\u2019t know.  It\u2019s hard to talk you or want to talk to you.\u201d I don\u2019t know, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So, anyway. I don\u2019t know. There was several rounds of . . . about same [kind of] (ph) things. Her saying, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything right.\u201d And then me, being like, \u201cNo,\u201d and\u2014I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I think she eventually got that I wasn\u2019t trying to tear her down. I was just trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">to, I don\u2019t know, make things better, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.

And it shifts, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">as you said, into this victim mode, where it\u2019s changing the subject of the conversation. It\u2019s no longer as though what you\u2019re saying is really what\u2019s on the table.  It\u2019s how victimized she\u2019s feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">I would imagine, instead, you would have wanted to hear from her something more about . . . trying to\u2014her being able to take in that you\u2019re so angry.
