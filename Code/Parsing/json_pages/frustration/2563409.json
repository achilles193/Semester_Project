So number one, my mom\u2019s been having a hard time because they just offered her a full time position at the preschool, but just for the next three months. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">needed to create another classroom, and like parents were up in arms because they don\u2019t like their kids to be shifted to new classrooms in the middle of the school year. A new teacher was going to be called in. She\u2019d be the assistant teacher but it was like a little more money and it\u2019s just for three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">months, so whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">She\u2019s been having a hard time because she doesn\u2019t do well with taking on responsibility or feeling empowered in any way and so I\u2019ve been giving her a lot of advice or just being a sounding board. And then anytime I\u2019ve been doing that she\u2019s been crying because I tell her the truth. Like the other day\u2014what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">did someone say to her? People just disrespect her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">She got assigned with this woman, who\u2019s the head teacher and my mom\u2019s the assistant teacher, and this head woman said something to her. Something that put her down. I can\u2019t even remember what it was, but I basically said to my mom, \u201cThis is yet another opportunity for you to be able to stand up for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">yourself. Like, this happens to you your whole life. Maybe the universe keeps throwing these situations at you so that you can finally just dominate this. You know?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And she starts crying and I have to soothe her. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m crying because you\u2019re right and I have to do this and I don\u2019t know how.\u201d And then last night she told me, \u201cSo I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I\u2019m convinced that you are my mother reincarnated.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">tell me more.\u201d And she said, \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. It\u2019s not that you look like her, but you act like her. Like her mannerisms, her spirit, the way she was, things that she would say, how she would talk to me. It\u2019s amazing. I don\u2019t know how\u2014there\u2019s no way you\u2019ve learned that because she died when I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">six months old, you know? So it\u2019s just amazing. So I\u2019m convinced. Her spirit or something reincarnated in you.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And I mean, it\u2019s cute and everything. Like I thought\u2014because I feel very connected to my grandma even though I didn\u2019t know her, but what does that say about our relationship. I\u2019m your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What was that like to hear \u201cYou\u2019re the mother\u201d? What did that mean to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It was just reaffirming what I already knew. I\u2019ve always known that. It\u2019s just weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I guess some way it communicates to you as well that like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could be your mother.\u201d (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I mean, not all across the board but in certain ways that we\u2019ve been describing. With these particular areas of who you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I mean clearly\u2014like remember the whole Sally Mae mess when I was financially very depressed? She stopped calling! She just disappeared. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah. That\u2019s exactly what I mean. That mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: And sending me little messages like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You weren\u2019t born with an instruction manual. Please forgive me. I did the best I could.\u201d The other thing that just popped into my head, but I thought it was important. The other day, I was talking to my friend Carly, who goes to analysis like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">four times a week or something, she\u2019s been going to the same woman (ph) for 15 years. And I don\u2019t know, I tell her about stuff going on in my life and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, so what does Royce (ph) say?\u201d And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t tell me what to do. Like, we\u2019re not supposed to tell people <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">what to do. I don\u2019t know. I guess I make a point and sometimes he connects it to my past and gives me some insight.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, but what\u2019s it like. Like how does he make his points?\u201d I guess she really wanted to know what it looks like in here and I said to her, \u201cSometimes I even feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">I\u2019m in supervision and we\u2019re supervising a case that\u2019s my life.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Interesting. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: And I really took that in and thought to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s totally how I feel.\u201d Sometimes I feel like we are talking about almost someone else and trying to conceptualize it and understand it together. And I thought to myself in the car just now, \u201cOkay. That could be useful because it could be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">very collaborative. On the other hand, what\u2019s the down side?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">Well, I\u2019m not in the room and I\u2019m neglecting kind of whatever\u2019s going on in between us. The relationship. Because I think that that\u2019s \u2013it\u2019s like connected to the stuff we were talking about last week. Like there\u2019s the distancing. And I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m doing that. It\u2019s just more comfortable for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. But maybe it\u2019s getting into some of that\u2014you know, to kind of connect with what you\u2019re just saying about your mom. There\u2019s something about you feeling like there\u2019s a kind of\u2014you\u2019re (ph) almost like we\u2019re co-mothering you or something. We\u2019re mothering you from a distance. We together <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">collaborating to mother another you that\u2019s\u2026 (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s too uncomfortable to talk about it as if it was me. So there\u2019s a part of me that when we\u2019re in here I just think like, \u201cIt\u2019s a case. It\u2019s a case we\u2019re discussing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like the last time that we were here we were talking about the feeling that\u2019s more\u2014you know, [that kind of hints] (ph) at a more \u201cWhat\u2019s here and now between us.\u201d (inaudible at 00:06:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: It goes back to the whole theme of just integrating certain things together and how I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m not very good at that. I had a horrible weekend and I think it had to do with integrating two different parts, two different sides of people, the whole theme of just integration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">So it started on Saturday. Saturday night I got invited to a masquerade ball. My friend at her house, she lives in Arlington, she\u2019s a co-worker. She invited a bunch of people, including co-workers and the theme was masks. She put out a table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: She was sort of [fitting you] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. She went to this fancy costume store and got these very extravagant, glittery, feathery masks and the whole place was decorated. Very kind of surreal like. These people, they\u2019re very wealthy. They live in a house in Arlington and she\u2019s on the third story and they own the first and second <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">story. They had weird art on the walls. They had just a pink painting of baby dolls, like naked baby dolls, but only the head and the chest. Just like contemporary weird art. And then they had put like Jamestmas lights. It felt like we were at some weird club or something and I was excited about it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">because James was going to come with me and I was going to get to introduce him to all my co-workers. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">This is the GWU (ph) family that, you know, that my co-workers know. They\u2019re not my supervisors. So the associate director was there. My current supervisor was there. Even though it\u2019s more like consulting, he\u2019s supervising me. Penelope was the host, who was my supervisor last year, who I talked about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">her in here. How I was her first supervisee and I feel so close to her. And two other ladies were there and some of their wives were there, or partners. And I was not worried about it at all, and then as the party progressed, I guess it started turning weird the more I drank. Like, I made sure to not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">go overboard because I was driving home. I didn\u2019t want to be a mess in front of co-workers and it was\u2014but there was this like ambiance to it that was just weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">I joked with Penelope in the lunch room before, last week sometime, and I was joking like, \u201cHave you ever seen the movie \u2018Eyes Wide Shut?\u2019 (chuckles) Penelope, am I going to walk into your house and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be like?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, go for it. I mean, we\u2019re going to have plenty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">of champagne. If that\u2019s what it leads to, hey, everyone\u2019s wearing masks.\u201d And I think I had that in my head. Just the weirdness of it. Like the Stanley Kubrik kind of weirdness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">The host of the party was this tall bald man wearing a tuxedo. They were like all dressed up, wearing a really creepy mask with a long nose, and he kept popping bottles of champagne. These people were so wealthy, they had boxes of champagne and beer. So every few minutes you hear like, \u201cpop\u201d of champagne <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">and he\u2019d go around and just excess, you know? It was like a very seductive kind of feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">And then I noticed that downstairs\u2014James is very good at just mingling and he doesn\u2019t need to be by my side. So he was mingling a lot and then I noticed downstairs it started smelling like cigarettes and there was like a basement and I saw like sparkly lights or something coming from down there. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">I work my way down there. There was a few people and I found James down there and James comes up to me and he was like, \u201cDude, your supervisor was just passing around pot.\u201d I was like, \u201cThere\u2019s weed down here?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, don\u2019t you smell it?\u201d And he occasionally smokes pot, so he was all excited <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">about it and I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. She\u2019s smoking pot.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">And I saw Penelope sitting there and I could smell it in the air, and then I guess I started getting self-conscious because I would compliment Penelope a lot. I feel close to her and I was so excited to be at her house and everything. It was like the cool girl at school invited me to her house. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">what I felt like. I met her girlfriend for the first time, who she\u2019s ranted and raved about, and she\u2019d ask me, \u201cDo you like working at GWU?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my God. I love it. Plus, I get to work with Penelope and how cool is that? She\u2019s one of my favorite people.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">And I think we were just like gathered around there and Penelope was there and I said something like, \u201cOh yeah. Penelope\u2019s like a rock star at GWU.\u201d And she made like a face or something and I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s what the post-docs used to always call her. Like she\u2019s a rock star. She\u2019s just so cool <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">and very good plenition, an awesome person. And she said something, like she sounded annoyed. And she was like, \u201cStop. That\u2019s like a lot to live up to.\u201d And James reminded me later, she was really high. And she\u2019s probably paranoid, but then I started getting paranoid. Like, am I throwing myself on her? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">Like praising her too much or something. And it got awkward and weird, but I\u2019m not sure if it was because she was really high.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">So anyways, we went back upstairs and people are still talking and mingling and I\u2019m starting to feel more and more uncomfortable as the night goes on and I don\u2019t know why. And then suddenly there\u2019s this living room and there\u2019s a fireplace and Penelope, I\u2019m later told she was so high, she grabbed two <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">logs and threw them in. And suddenly (inaudible 00:12:16) like all the fire went and the room is dimly lit with sparkly lights and there\u2019s this fire raging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">And then suddenly, Rich, who\u2019s my supervisor, starts dancing with his wife and Lola starts dancing with her partner. Lola\u2019s the associate director. Penelope starts dancing all seductively and Wendy\u2019s over there dancing too. And I\u2019m standing here talking to Penelope\u2019s girlfriend and suddenly I look into <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">the room and there\u2019s my supervisors dancing, wearing masks with the fire blazing in the background, and it just looked like such a weird scene. It freaked me out. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s stupid, but it was just weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">And I was even mentioning to Eva, I was like, \u201cThis is kind of a surreal moment right now.\u201d And she starts laughing and she\u2019s like, \u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d I was like, \u201cThis is just weird. All these people were my supervisors last year and here they are. A little tipsy and dancing and wow, look at Penelope <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">go.\u201d Penelope was like shaking her ass and doing some weird stuff, and I was just like, \u201cOkay. Time to go.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: How was that for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Do you know what was (inaudible at 00:13:29)? What did you find?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Well, I started thinking about like what it felt like with my family, because I see them as a family. I always joke that GWU, my coworkers at GWU, are like a more functional family than my natural family. It\u2019s a family system. I look very much at Bill like a father figure. Like this professional <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">older man, like I want his praises and I want his approval. Lola\u2019s like a mom. Penelope is like a big sister. We communicate about stuff. Stuff that\u2019s uncomfortable to talk about, that in my family we\u2019d never discuss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">Like when I was going for the job, and how awkward it was sitting there and getting interviewed. We\u2019d be able to talk through stuff like that. And here I was seeing them in a different light. And it freaked me out. I didn\u2019t want to join in. James even jokingly came up to me to pull me to dance. He doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">even dance, but he was being a good sport and I was just like, \u201cGet away.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I want to keep a divide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yes. And at the end of the party, well, Penelope had showed me earlier. She took a bunch of us upstairs to show us her apartment. And then we went to the kitchen and there were a bunch of brownies and she\u2019s like, \u201cYes, and these are my pot brownies.\u201d I totally thought she was joking. She was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">serious. And then at the end of the party, James comes up to me. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou getting tired? Yeah. Me too. Hold on, but your friend promised me a brownie.\u201d I was like, \u201cAre you serious? She\u2019s really going to give you one? And they\u2019re really pot brownies?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Penelope was really going to give him one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so we said, \u201cGoodbye. Thank you.\u201d And then that\u2019s when Rich, my current supervisor walked up and James said, \u201cOh, remember that thing?\u201d So Penelope like grabs a Ziploc bag with a brownie and hands it to James like right in front of Rich and that just made me so uncomfortable. But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">So, we left and I remember already being agitated as I\u2019m walking to the car. And I was like, \u201cPenelope was so weird tonight. I feel like she was annoyed or does she feel like I like her too much or I\u2019m coming on too strong?\u201d And James was like, \u201cCalm down. You\u2019re fine. She\u2019s paranoid. She\u2019s probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">smoked a lot. Did you see her throw the logs into the thing?\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess. Whatever.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">And then I\u2019m driving. And as I\u2019m driving, I\u2019m getting more and more irritated. And I\u2019m expressing to James, who\u2019s sitting next to me, like, I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m pissed. And I actually feel like I want to be mean to you. And he started just getting really quiet and out of nowhere I had an association, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">a story I hadn\u2019t thought of in years. I think I might have told you this. That freshman year of college, they were advertising for the volleyball team, and I was like, \u201cHey. I\u2019ve never been in sports. I\u2019m not athletic. You don\u2019t have to try out. You can join. I want to be part of a team. I want to see <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">what that\u2019s like.\u201d And so I joined the volleyball team for like a month, because you didn\u2019t have to try out or anything. And I liked it. We would go to practice together and I was like, \u201cThis is cool. I\u2019ve never had teammates.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">And then suddenly they had a party. And this is like October freshman year, like brand new to college. And the party was out of control. It was in an empty house. I think someone\u2019s dad was trying to sell the house and so they got the keys and we had an empty house to ourselves. I got so wasted. I started <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">stripping with the stripper that they hired. And I know that there was a video camera and I know that I had my eye on some guy\u2014because it was the girls\u2019 team and the boys\u2019 team. So I had my eye on some guy and I said to myself, \u201cBy the end of the night I\u2019m going to end up with him.\u201d And I have flashes <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">of us being in the bathroom. I think I had sex on the counter with him. I don\u2019t remember. I think the guy with the video camera might have come in for a second.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">And then the next thing you know I\u2019m standing naked in the shower calling my friend Ashley to help me. And I said to her, \u201cOh my God. I\u2019m so embarrassed. I\u2019m completely naked.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cMelanie, I think you were in here just having sex.\u201d And she helped me get dressed and I went home. And it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">just like humiliation the day after because I didn\u2019t remember. I was like, \u201cOh my God. I have flashes of me dancing with someone dressed up as a cop.\u201d Who knows what I did? Who knows what I said? And I ended up quitting the volleyball team. It was the worst day. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">The next day my mom called me and said, \u201cWe got a letter saying you\u2019re failing your classes. What\u2019s going on?\u201d So obviously I couldn\u2019t keep up with just social life and practice and academics. So I quit. It was an easy out. Like, \u201cWow. I never want to face those people again. I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d But <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">for some reason, I remembered that story in the car. And somehow, it was just word vomit. I could not stop talking and I could hear myself. I was like, \u201cMelanie, you sound like a crazy person.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: What sounded crazy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: I started rambling and saying stuff like, \u201cYeah. And you know that sexual assault group I run sometimes? Sometimes the girls in there will tell stories about how they were totally trashed and how it wasn\u2019t their fault, and I feel like saying, \u2018You\u2019re the bitch. It was totally your fault. Why <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">would you get yourself in that stupid situation?\u2019\u201c And James was like, \u201cOh, you think it\u2019s because you\u2019re angry at yourself? Because you feel partially responsible?\u201d And I was like, \u201cOf course I do.\u201d Like I was so stupid. Of course something like that was going to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">And then I was just rambling stuff like, \u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t even like myself. Do you ever think about just dying?\u201d I know that people love me. I know that my sister loves me. You care. My mom cares. But really? Life is too hard. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to just shut it off and like, just die. Do you ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D1\">think about that?\u201d And then I go to the next subject, \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. I don\u2019t even want a dog, because dogs are going to die one day. Why would I get married? I\u2019d never get married, because what if my husband dies?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you never want to get married?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D2\">And I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019 know?\u201d I was just being\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Your just [going to stream of consciousness] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes, but it was like my rational self was trying to hold on, saying like, \u201cYou sound nuts. Calm down. This is not you anymore. It reminded me of the person I was when I was with Kevin (sp?) and drinking a lot, and just unstable, not going to therapy. And then we got upstairs to the apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">and I just got more mean. I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off.\u201d I feel like\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Do you know what it was that was pissing you off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: He was just so calm and together and not fighting back. And so healthy. Mentally healthy. It pissed me off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: What about it, him being healthy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: That I was out of control, that I was the crazy one, that I felt crazy with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yes! Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It kind of almost made you feel like there was some comparison going on or something between\u2014I\u2019m this crazy\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And at the moment, I also remembered that he\u2019s told me before, \u2018I\u2019ve been with women before who I thought were normal for a while and then suddenly, here comes their borderline side. And suddenly, here comes their side where they\u2019re trying to push me away, they don\u2019t want a commitment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">It was almost as if I was trying to play into that. Like, \u201cLet me show you. I can be like that.\u201d And we\u2019re in the kitchen, I remember, and he\u2019s like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go to bed?\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, no. I don\u2019t want to go to bed because then you\u2019re going to want to fuck!\u201d I was just so obnoxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">and rough. And he just threw his hands up and went to the room. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">I\u2019m lucky I controlled myself because I could have gotten really mean and I would have started saying stuff like, \u201cI don\u2019t even orgasm with you and it doesn\u2019t even feel good.\u201d If I were more drunk, I think I would have gone there. I\u2019m so glad I wasn\u2019t more drunk. But it wasn\u2019t just the alcohol, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">I\u2019ve gotten a lot more wasted than that with James. Like just on a night that we\u2019re at home watching movies. I was so angry and he said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t change like this.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, well maybe we should just break up. Do you want to break up?\u201d And then he just kept on trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F2\">to avoid. Like, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">And then we got into bed and I\u2019m just laying there angry. And then he said something like, \u201cYou know what I think is happening? I think that you are caring and growing closer and closer to me and that scares you and right now you\u2019re trying to push me away. Can I hug you?\u201d And I let him hug me for a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">minute, but then I said something else that was mean. I can\u2019t remember what it was. Something self-deprecating or something like that. And it pissed him off and he pulled away from me and he looked really serious and he\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d And it really scared me for a moment because I thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200812\">that he was either going to ask me to leave or sleep in the living room. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">But I knew at that moment, \u201cShut it off,\u201d because he\u2019s not going to take more of this. I knew he had reached his limit. And so then he said something to me like, \u201cMelanie, I can\u2019t do this. Please stop or I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d And I knew he\u2019d either kick me out or I didn\u2019t want it to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200831\">get worse and so I said, \u201cSorry\u201d and I let him hug me, and that\u2019s it. And I went to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">I felt so bad the next day and it was still lingering a little bit. It was a weird sensation. I felt crazy because it was still a little bit of that angriness and I guess I was a little hung over, but I didn\u2019t even drink that much. And the weed brownie, he ate it. He gave me like a bite because I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">never had one before, so it wasn\u2019t like intoxication. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: No. I hear it is somehow related to the party.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I kept saying to myself in my head the next day, \u201cI want to be okay again. I just want to be the healthy me again where I go to work, I go to therapy, I have fun on weekends, I can control myself, I\u2019m not crazy, I\u2019m not angry, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s two sides pulling. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200891\">But finally, as the day went on, more and more, I felt more like myself again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">But I haven\u2019t experienced that in a long time. Like just that anger. That anger again? I think the last time I had it was with Brian when I got really drunk and I showed up at his house. And it\u2019s funny because I looked at my text the next day and during the fight, when James went to his room, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">was outside putting on my pajamas and getting ready for bed, I remember typing to Brian. I typed something like, \u201cI\u2019m so fucking pissed off right now. I wish you were here with me. I need you. I love you. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m yours.\u201d Something like that. James can\u2019t tolerate it. James can\u2019t put up with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well there\u2019s a way too that, I was thinking, that Brian would go there. Yeah. He\u2019ll enter that in too and somehow make it feel like, I don\u2019t know, but that another side of you can come out. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">CLIENT: So the next morning I apologized and I was like, \u201cI feel horrible. I feel like such an ass hole. I\u2019m so sorry. I think you\u2019re right. That part of it is that I feel close to you and for some reason, a part of me is trying to push you away. Like I almost want to show you like, \u2018See what you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F1\">getting into? Are you sure you want this? Because this comes with some crazy.\u2019\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">THERAPIST: It sounds to me like it\u2019s a way of you trying to\u2014you know, we were talking about how is he going to know this other side of you? How are you going to bridge these things together? I think this was like some way you went there with him and wanted him to see another side of you, a lot of feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">inside of you that are there. You know? And something about that party, and especially on the heels of us talking about here. About you being here. And I guess the other thing to throw in the mix is, I think there\u2019s something about when you talked about the party and Penelope, it made me think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200912\">the issue that you raised last week about what happens when it\u2019s about you and me. In some way that, I think, well, is that a response to\u2014the night that you just described as a response to that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">Here\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about. What are you going to learn about me? What are you going to learn about\u2014and what I mean by \u201cme\u201d is like is there another side to me? Is there some other side to me\u2014what if I see another side of you? Here, with me, that emerges. You know, some sort of interplay about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200931\">focusing on us?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: But of course there is. You know? Of course you\u2019re a person outside of here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah and you feel kind of like it\u2019s hard to kind of go\u2014it feels like, \u201cDo we go there or not? Is it safe to go there?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why it makes me cry (crying). I feel like after the party I\u2019m so disappointed in a way. I didn\u2019t even want to see them today; I was hiding in my office practically the whole day. I didn\u2019t even want to see Penelope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">THERAPIST: What did you feel about seeing Penelope? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe disappointment? Yeah. But of course these are normal people with normal lives outside of the office. You know? Who drink, who have fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well just to say maybe the most kind of general thing I can about it, but I think that maybe it\u2019s important here is that I think there is a link to your experience of people (inaudible at 00:29:07) your relationship with your parents, it\u2019s really important here. It\u2019s like you saw a sign of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F1\">your mother and your step-father. When you saw another side to them, it was a kind of a more scary side when you saw that side. How far does it go becomes a critical question to you. Who are they really? Is this just a mask? And I think it kind of upsets or upends your kind of notions of a person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">CLIENT: To know all the sides of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">THERAPIST: To know that the sides of them. Yeah. Like Penelope; seeing this other side. Is she still that supervisor? How do you reconcile this other side of her with the more person that you needed to get to mentor you. That you needed to get a lot out of was important figure (ph) for you. How you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A31\">reconcile that with this other side of her. And does that undo this other side? Sometimes it feels like it does. And maybe it\u2019s the same here. If you feel like you kind of get into it. What is this guy like? What is he really like as a real person, [quote on quote] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want to know.

Brian it disrupt that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">CLIENT: It shouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019m scared it might. But then that makes me like a total hypocrite because isn\u2019t that what I\u2019m looking for in Brian or James, for them to see all the sides of me and accept them and be able to see me as a whole? I can\u2019t even do that with people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s kind of along the same lines. I mean, in terms of like you feel too. Well, if I\u2019m this person, how can I still be this other person? I want to get the good me back because I just went to a bad place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">CLIENT: I feel so disconnected from myself in those moments of the angry. Like the next morning, it feels like a different person. It feels very regressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not the mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking about you talking about the mother here. The one that knows what to do and how to be caring and you know. I\u2019m this other person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. So creepy how that party was a masquerade with the masks. Everyone else had a fine time. Today I ran into Rich in the hallway and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, did you see the video that Lola (sp?) sent us of us dancing?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t get. \u201cAnd he was like, \u201cOh, probably because you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B51\">weren\u2019t in it.\u201d It was like when everyone from GWU happened to be in the same room and the fire was blazing. I was like, \u201cNo. I remember that scene.\u201d It\u2019s like etched in my brain forever. And I was like, \u201cYeah. Who threw in those logs? What was up with that? Because it was like blazing.\u201d And he started <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B52\">laughing and saying, \u201cPenelope did. She was\u2026\u201d What did he say? What\u2019s the word that\u2019s not \u201chigh,\u201d but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Stoned? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">CLIENT: \u201cShe was stoned out of her mind.\u201d And like laughing about it and just being okay with it. So I felt a little bit better after that. That he didn\u2019t judge it, I guess? And that maybe she was acting a little paranoid or weird with me because she was so intoxicated and I didn\u2019t realize it? And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B91\">it was just weird seeing people at work today. Like my Associate Director, who I look as a mom. She walked past the hallway and smiled at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. No. I can see it. I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like the same experience I used to have with\u2014I mean, now that I\u2019m thinking back to it, like with my mom. Not that it registered like that in the moment, when I was 16 and I would\u2014you know, Billy would be in the bathroom with us after they got home from a nightclub and I\u2019d be holding her <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD1\">hair back and he\u2019d be there with a hard (ph) on and with his underwear on, and she\u2019s like, \u201cGet out of here.\u201d And then the next day was like, \u201cBig happy family\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s go out for breakfast.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s something about that. What a mask (ph). What a mask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C1\">CLIENT: The other thing\u2014my Associate Director, who I really look up to, even though she\u2019s an anxious jittery person, the other thing I remember is that at the party, she was so anxious. So socially anxious. Like the most awkward socially anxious person ever. Like she wouldn\u2019t know what to say with me <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C11\">to make conversation and at work she\u2019s just so put together. So that kind of weirded me out too. But these people are different when they\u2019re not [in our office] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think that just really kind of freaked you out. It spooked you. It sounds like it really spooked you. I mean, look at the associations you make to it. Like that party. The party at Jamaica.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C5\">CLIENT: The parents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C7\">THERAPIST: The parents. Absolutely. Yeah. There\u2019s so much there and I\u2019m curious about\u2014you find yourself feeling very angry. Angry at James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C9\">CLIENT: And feeling completely disgusted with myself. Like it\u2019s a very anger at myself too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB\">THERAPIST: What form?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Do you remember what you felt at you? You felt disgusted with yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D1\">CLIENT: I felt disgusted with myself. I remember I had spent so much time earlier doing my makeup and doing my hair, and then I just looked in the mirror when I was at the party and I was like, \u201cI look like a disgusting mess.\u201d Might as well not even have showered or (inaudible at 00:36:39) my hair or <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D11\">anything. I look disgusting. And then it was the kind of self-hatred, like when we park the car and got home, if a truck had come over and run me over, I wouldn\u2019t have cared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to describe to James too. That feeling. I feel, all of a sudden, disgusted and trying to articulate that to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, and then when he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s go into the bedroom,\u201d and I was like, \u201cNo. You might want to sleep with me. I\u2019m disgusting.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m disgusting. Yeah. Not necessarily out of some kind of rejection of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">CLIENT: No. But that\u2019s how he took it. But many times with Kevin (sp?), I remember when I was really drunk and angry, and he tried to make things better by being intimate. That was a lot of why I didn\u2019t want to do anything. I just felt so disgusted with myself. (Pause) I don\u2019t know why it pops its head <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D91\">up every once in a while, that anger I feel. I used to have so much of it all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Well I think it\u2019s because\u2014it sounds like it was like a burst of feeling. Just like the fires being thrown on the log. I mean, the log being thrown on the fire. And there\u2019s so many little things in there, in the soup (ph) for you there about what it meant to see, to see all these people in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB1\">this kind way that was bringing up a lot of feeling. What it\u2019s like for them to see you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll think twice if we get an invitation to something like this again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF\">THERAPIST: It was really unsettling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was unsettling. That\u2019s the word. And it shouldn\u2019t have been. Everyone else seemed so fine and they\u2019d done this before, and of course I wasn\u2019t invited last year because I was a post-doc. Wouldn\u2019t have been so appropriate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You\u2019re not supposed to see us this way. Yeah. That is a (inaudible at 00:38:54). Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E5\">CLIENT: Like [even like] (ph) little images. My brain feels like a Stanley Kubrick movie now. So there\u2019s this girl that was a post-doc the year before me. She was there at the party. And everybody just looked so different because they were all wearing masks and she was wearing a long gown. And I remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E51\">seeing her back only because her dress at the back was very low cut. So it was like right above her ass and the whole thing was open. And she has this huge tattoo on the side, and I remember just being in the kitchen and having a drink and then looking at her back and was just thinking to myself, \u201cWow. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E52\">That\u2019s really sexy. She\u2019s pretty.\u201d And then all of a sudden Penelope comes and says, \u201cOh. Do you remember so and so? She was a post-doc.\u201d And it was just like weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563409\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E7\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E9\">CLIENT: She looked very sexual. She had dressed herself up and this tattoo and her back showing. It\u2019s just mixing all these things. It\u2019s the mixing of the sexual and the intoxicated and the\u2026 with everything just put together and formal and appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Well, there was something too, that the way you just described your family\u2014how that you\u2019d have this moment of kind of, you know, being in the bathroom, holding your mother up. Billy in there with an erection. And then cut to the next scene and there was a divide with a nice happy family. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200EB1\">(Alarm ringing) Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200ED\">CLIENT: It looks like an old school cell (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It has an alarm on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. But there\u2019s a split.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F3\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a split and those two things, almost if they just can\u2019t go together. They (inaudible at 00:41:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F5\">CLIENT: No wonder I can\u2019t have an orgasm with James. That\u2019s starting to get on my nerves. I look at him when I\u2019m being intimate with him, and I can\u2019t get out of my mind like the nice guy that he is. Just so kind and loving and funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F7\">THERAPIST: And what do you feel amid that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even feel present. It\u2019s horrible to say, but I almost feel like I\u2019m faking it sometimes like I used to with Kevin. Never with Brian have I had a moment\u2014Brian and I used to joke about how sometimes women are just like if the guy isn\u2019t in their vision, the woman might be rolling her eyes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200F91\">like \u201cOkay. Hurry up and finish so I can go do whatever I want to do.\u201d And I start feeling like that with James. And never for a second did I ever feel that with Brian. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s somehow very much in the treatment that he has towards you, that makes you feel disconnected from it. I think, as you suggested it, it has something to do with the divide between sexuality and that (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FD\">CLIENT: And I almost see him as selfish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20101\">CLIENT: Because, I mean, I guess he tries to please me, but nothing happens, and then he finishes and I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d (phone rings) Speak of the devil. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20103\">THERAPIST: Or the angel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And I guess I smile and pretend I am too and it makes me happy to please him. And it does make me happy to please him, but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201051\">starting to feel a lot like my relationship with Kevin that I get the companionship but not the sex life.
