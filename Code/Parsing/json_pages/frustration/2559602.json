And then I'm away the first week of August, which is the 5th. So I guess we'll that'll be four weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Okay.

Just to put that out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Thanks.

I think support I still believe is the thing we need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">(Pause): [00:04:11 00:04:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I guess, one is do you have a recommendation of a counselor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I have a couple of accredited people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Great. So I would appreciate their names but I don't need that at the moment, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll definitely check. Some people are away and so forth, so I can see. I guess you'd wanted to start it after -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: It seems silly to start it this week or next week and then be gone for three weeks. But I mean it's really two weeks but somehow it's three Wednesdays, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">(Pause): [00:04:51 00:05:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: It does seem like on the forefront of your mind -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">(Pause): [00:05:09 00:05:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Tanya and I had a, I guess a fight Friday evening or something like that which wasn't particularly pleasant but looking back on it, it's well we're both alive, so that's probably okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">(Pause): [00:05:34 00:05:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: So it was our I think it was last Wednesday was our third wedding anniversary, so it's a very small celebratory thing Wednesday evening. She was working Wednesday and Thursday and then Friday we sort of had the date night and it was good. So her family on birthdays like most people just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B1\">say, \"happy birthday,\" her family has this thing where they say, \"I'm glad you were born.\" Which I think is a really nice sentiment. It's sounds a little funny but it's nice. And so for anniversaries, one of the things that she says is, \"I'm glad I'm married to you,\" or, \"I'm glad I married you.\" Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B2\">that's not exactly a thing that I am sure that I can say truthfully at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">(Pause): [00:06:38 00:06:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: And, if I were a different person I would, knowing that I'm not going to leave her and that we're going to continue to be married I would just say it back and because it would be expedient, but it's just not who I am or what I do or something. So,<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559602\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">(Pause): [00:07:06 00:07:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: So after I didn't respond to it several times she asked if I was glad to be married to her and I don't remember exactly what I said. But I think it was something along the lines of what I just said in terms of like, 'I'm not going anywhere, but am I glad that my lives are where they are? No! <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">And it seems a little unreasonable to expect me to be glad.' Yeah, I'm glad she's alive but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">(Pause): [00:08:15 00:08:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: You know, we've had that conversation several times so I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">(Pause): [00:08:24 00:09:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: So in general we're in this place where she doesn't really talk to me about her emotions anymore which in a sense is a sharp change. She doesn't talk about them much because I think, because I couldn't handle hearing about them when she was just coming back from having no memory. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">she was not really she couldn't really remember the crisis and she couldn't really remember how we made all the decisions that we made and she couldn't remember almost anything about where she was or how she got there and so she was upset about these things and that's fine, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">(Pause): [00:10:10 00:10:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: When we make our decisions they are rarely defensible, I find. Or I find it difficult to defend them down the road in light of later information and more knowledge, but that's not the situation in which you make the decision. You make the decision with what you have at the time, the resources, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">the whatever, and you do it. And so I don't think she was asking for an account of the decisions, but it felt like that was what she was asking for and I couldn't give it and I particularly couldn't give it at that time because we've talked about me sort of her getting better and me getting worse <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F2\">at the same time as part of the same thing in some way. So I'm not doing particularly well, or was not doing particularly well during those times and she was just you know, she was angry about the ECT and she (Pause) didn't know why she left Brown couldn't remember her time there really which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F3\">that's like two years' worth of time that should not be gone but was gone. And she's gotten some of that back now through reading journals but and so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">(Pause): [00:11:49 00:12:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Basically, I couldn't handle it. I told her I couldn't handle it and I asked her to talk to someone else about it because I couldn't do it then because I had very few reserves and I was apprehensive about the prospect of another crisis and about not having enough reserves for a crisis. Now I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">don't know that that was necessary or correct, but that was what happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">(Pause): [00:12:33 00:12:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: I don't really confide most of my feelings in her because I've thought for a long time that she can't handle it and that so that's a not great place for us to be in. That was all (unclear) besides there, but I'm not sure exactly where it was, trying to recount the essence of this conflict<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">(Pause): [00:13:27 00:13:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: I think it comes down to something like I think that I feel angry about what's happened and she is proud she didn't kill herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">(Pause): [00:13:54 00:14:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: And I think she should be. But I also think that that is -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559602\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">(Pause): [00:14:18 00:14:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Tunnel vision?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Neglects anything that anyone else has done around her deciding not to kill her as if it didn't matter. And in some sense it really didn't matter. I've said that to you before. If she decided to kill herself, I'm not sure that there was anything I could do to stop that within <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">some margin of error. You know, if I'm there and she tries to kill herself there's something that I might be able to do but yeah, at some point it comes down to that but (Pause) but I'm upset that she got to the point where that was the battle she had to fight and I don't she does not think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">that is her fault in some way. Or, perhaps in the process that she is in she cannot yet handle that being a thing that she could have done anything differently about. But here's the thing that I took away from that a day or two later that's not really the point. That doesn't really matter. That all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200853\">happened. Nothing is going to undo it. It just happened. But there is life ahead and we can make different decisions moving forward but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">(Pause): [00:16:02 [00:16:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I think there is the sense in rehashing what happened with her repeatedly is not going to do either of us any good. I don't see what we're going to gain from it, so I'm not sure that that's the like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">(Pause): [00:16:24 00:16:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: How do you mean, \"rehashing\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">(Pause): [00:16:40 00:17:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Going back through again and again trying to figure out how and why it happened, I think that's what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">(Pause): [00:17:19 00:17:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: It doesn't seem that that's where you're focus is and your sort of \"bone of contention,\" for a lack of better word, is. I think about our conversation between the difference between accountability and responsibility that even if Tanya wasn't responsible for what unfolded or the decision she <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">did make, that you want her to feel a sense of accountability toward you and appreciate that what happened didn't happen in a vacuum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">(Pause): [00:18:06 00:18:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And what you're describing this is sort of more extreme, more than I mean, but so I really can't find the right word, but sort of obliviousness on her part that there might be greater implications than simply whether she's alive or dead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And her response to that sort of feels that she didn't want to hurt me, she tried not to hurt me but she did anyway. (Pause) Which I hear and understand (Pause), on one level. I think that not hurting me was one way that she kept herself from killing herself. It was a tie that kept her <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">here, that desire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">(Pause): [00:19:16 00:19:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: But seriously, her mother has a history of suicidality and left her when she was eight. She understands what abandonment is. She knows how much it hurts. That's how she got here in some sense. Like, and that excuse sounds pretty flimsy on some level, like, 'I didn't know what I was doing,' is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">what it sounds like it reduces to to me, but, 'no you didn't care to know what you were doing. You didn't bother to know what you were doing or I let you do it by telling you I could take it in the view that you were doing the best you could.' But, I'm not sure that that's true now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">(Pause): [00:20:02 00:20:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: But when someone says, 'that's the best I can do, is not kill myself, and I was barely able to do that,' what do you say? Not that that's what she said, but I feel like that's what in some sense it reduces to. Part of it's, 'I'm glad you're not dead.' That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559602\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">(Pause): [00:20:39 00:20:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And as you say that, the implication is that seems like a fairly low bar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean (Pause), I know it did not feel like a low bar to her at the time, so (Pause). See that's the thing, right? I was there. I remember it. I'm not relying on journals that I wrote sporadically. And when I was particularly bad, which she is, so she didn't have a clear sense of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">like anything other than (inaudible). So I guess she has a clear sense of what she felt when she was really not doing well, so hurray for keeping journals only when you're really depressed. That doesn't seem like the best recovery strategy on some level or this wasn't done with the intention of her <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A92\">referring back to them after she lost her memory.

So I feel like a much more reasonable strategy for moving <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">forward and rebuilding trust is to leave that piece alone somewhat and work to rebuild the trust in other places. Does that sound like the wrong way to handle it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I'm just not sure what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">(Pause): [00:23:17 00:23:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: We still live together. We're both still alive.

You know, (unclear) new dates, have new discussions, have new conversations or do we keep reliving this one event, extended sequence of horrible events? That's not to say that like (Pause) we need <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">to bury it or hide it or forget about it, but I'm not sure that like the best way to rebuild is by sifting through all of the ashes. Eventually, there's nothing left. You have to just start building something new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: That sort of imagery of a shadow, I think is a good one because there's the thing that creates a shadow, but the shadow is still there even if the you know, so there's implications for the now about the past. And I see what you're saying. I think there is a difference between rehashing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">and talking about how the past has current and future implications because we've talked about and I can't imagine it's not on your mind, is what does this mean about the future? Are there going to be other instances like this. Is this really in the past?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Sure. But those are -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">(Pause): [00:25:39 00:26:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Those aren't well-posed questions in the sense that there's no way to answer them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: There is no way to answer them so it's not about the yeah, it's not about whether they have been, it's about current fears. You have planning we talked about planning a lot and you're interest in planning, but you know, there is some way in which one wants to know, could make commitments <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">now because there are some assumptions about the future that can be greatly challenged and hopefully those plans are based on your past experience. And so asking those questions are important and having dialogues with them is important, it would seem to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559602\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">(Pause): [00:26:49 00:26:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Because they're current fears about potential future events that are grounded in something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">(Pause): [00:27:04 00:27:40] CLIENT: Yeah.

Part of the reluctance was it just seems like a lot of work and I wasn't ready to do it. I think I'm ready to do it now. I think I need to do it. I think it needs to be done. The other part of it is that I am not sure that I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB1\">meet with you and do that once a week, both of them. So I guess from a scheduling point of view, I don't know that I can make the time to do that and do everything else that I need to do.

I think that would be sort of the best just projecting my experience from the past. But I appreciate you have other things to do in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201271\">life like you have other things besides taking care of Tanya and you want to actively engage in the productive engagement of those things, so you know, I appreciate there is life outside of therapy. And so in that case, when you come to that decision, I guess my suggestion would be at least you did <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201272\">an initial several weeks for us to meet weekly to see how it goes and then if you feel that you know, the couples therapy sort of the couples therapy is productive, and you know, coming less faithfully here makes sense, then we could do that because that would be my sort next recommendation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: Okay.
