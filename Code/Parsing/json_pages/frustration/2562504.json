(pause) (crying) Also, doing a PhD makes it feel even more like drowning, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">I think it also forces me to sit with this because otherwise I feel like running off to lots of places and things, covering up the sadness.  (sniffles) But the weekend is for the people that I wish we were.

There are a lot of (inaudible at 00:13:53) trends to keep track of tissue consumption.  (pause) But maybe you were just concluding that humans are complicated [and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">there are no trends] (ph?).

(long pause)  You didn\u2019t sit very close to me. You are sitting over there and you\u2019re on the big, elevated <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">stool the laptop is on this side on the elevated table. It seems like maybe you were distracted. It didn\u2019t seem like that at all the other day. You were sort of casual and joking, not unlike sometimes how it actually is here.  But that was what it was like for the whole time and eventually you just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">got up and sat down and you asked if I wanted a hug and I said yes and you asked if I wanted you to be sitting or standing. It was very sweet. I don\u2019t think whatever was happening last night when I was dreaming, it was like I woke right as you were walking over here; but I sat down right when you sat <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">down and . . . I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, maybe it was right as you were asking.  But it felt like I woke up momentarily, like for a moment, somewhere like right at the point where it felt that you (inaudible at 00:19:24) and I don\u2019t know if I rolled through the rest of the dream or if I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200434\">back to sleep. It felt like I went back to sleep. I think my answer to the position was sitting, and then also standing up. (pause)  My dream [painter] (ph?) got your face so right. I arrived today and I was very, very, very struck by how close, how vivid all of your features were. You haven\u2019t been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200435\">rendered that faithfully in any other dream. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">I woke up for good, for the day, and I could feel myself seizing on that dream, like latching, and it made me so happy. And there was a really painful moment and another part of me said, \u201cAllison, that is never going to happen.\u201d  (long pause) I don\u2019t know what happened after that. I guess I started <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">my day. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m struck by you saying the word \u201clatching\u201d because I guess that makes me think of breast feeding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes. I had that thought and [I was surprised by it.] (ph?) (both chuckle) But it doesn\u2019t seem like a stretch. Yeah. It was a pretty nourishing dream.  It felt like it had \u2013 or it has \u2013 the power to fuel me. I think it did. It was kind of cruel, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Cool. You thought I said cool? It was a cool dream. At the moment, I\u2019m feeling cruelty more than cool.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: My sense is that you\u2019re feeling so sad, like heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.  (pause) And that it is excruciating, not that we\u2019re in this kind of relationship, but that we\u2019re not in another one and we\u2019re not together. (long pause)  That is what you want and the world is taking no account <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">of it and it\u2019s just awful. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: My dream painter is taking account of it. I don\u2019t know what that dream is. (pause) Is that a (inaudible at 00:32:13)? Or is it like a surrogate?  (pause) [More, I think, like the mother and the breast.] (ph?) Am I trying to fill in the things that you won\u2019t, for myself, by dreaming about it? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\"> Or is there actually a symbol that you have shown things or that we did together yesterday, and that what I dreamt about was as good as what happened? (pause)  Again, this is like what I was saying that, for some reason, I never got to see you again. The dream was sort of moved on in this beautiful <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">state. I know that\u2019s a ridiculous thing to say. I don\u2019t actually know what it would be like, but it\u2019s kind of like coming here is providing whatever \u2013 like healing of whatever wound that dream had kind of done. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562504\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yes. (pause)  Yeah, the way \u2013 I have a couple of thoughts. (pause) First, I want to be clear that I\u2019m not in any way trying to reduce what you\u2019re talking about to this, but I think it is sort of part of the backdrop. It made me think, with the mother stuff, about your mother leaving you at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">day care.  I\u2019m pretty sure, part of me is pretty sure, you weren\u2019t ever going to see her again and you\u2019re never going to see me again when you leave. In that way, maybe the dream is supposed to feel that or help heal that and it\u2019s supposed to help you feel helped or sort of remind you that I\u2019m not as <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">much gone forever as it feels like.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s sort of like that. Now it\u2019s like oh, okay; it\u2019s going to be good; it\u2019s going to be okay. And I sort of worked very happily all day without much worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Those are the other things I thought of, too, but that\u2019s kind of how it feels with you talking about how it wasn\u2019t like you woke up and [we haven\u2019t fucked.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: [So fuck isn\u2019t the dream?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, or oh, that\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m just going to like sit here and pull out \u2013 it was more like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I was tempted to do the latter. There was a moment, but that was kind of short and pretty quick. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I think it was soothing, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: In contrast?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: No, the dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: It was like the mother dog dream or that dream about . . . It was like the day before . . . I don\u2019t remember which lab meeting it was. Maybe it was the one in January.  I was pretty anxious about it \u2013 I told you about this \u2013 and I didn\u2019t feel like I could do this and that night I dreamt that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">you were in another room, talking to a young analyst in training and I left that room and went to another room. There was a mother dog and her puppies and she made her puppies go away and had me come onto the couch and was (inaudible at 00:39:54). It has that same power.  It was the same thing in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">morning. It was like oh, yeah, okay. I can go from this bed. I can go from my house to do my things. (long pause)  But the feeling ended and the reality of a not-dream came. (long pause)  Too sad. (long pause)  [It\u2019s too sad to be here with you and to not be here.] (ph?) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Okay, so I think maybe adding this session has helped kind of open things up because I think it made you feel like I understood something about how much that meant or would mean and needed another time after you had asked. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Like how much it would mean to me as a gesture?

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Which leaves you on your own with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: I guess a little like what you said about how we should be married, that I\u2019ll either protect myself or that will feel too close for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: That I said that, that it\u2019s too much for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m saying I imagine that\u2019s sort of something that you also might have felt I might need to protect myself from because it would feel too close for me.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, like it would feel too bad, too sad to you. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And I can\u2019t show that, so I have to kind of wall it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. This is getting elaborate. (sniggers)  I think talking about feeling like I want to be married to you feels like something that you need to protect against, compared to my talking about my wanting to hug you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: To me? (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: I feel completely lost in that. (long pause)  [My sense of self.] (ph?) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I think you probably feel awfully alone. You\u2019re wanting so much to be so close to me, physically and emotionally \u2013 physically hug and just very intimate in a way that I clearly am feeling like I\u2019m not up to. I could imagine you feel like you (inaudible at 01:19:49).

Maybe it does. I don\u2019t know. (long pause)  I guess it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">seems like it would be too scary for you, but I don\u2019t know why it would be too scary for you.

Like maybe you could list ten reasons why it\u2019s a bad idea why you wouldn\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: The real reason would be because I\u2019m too scared and because of how it would make me feel that I don\u2019t want to be feeling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: I\u2019m scared that I dreamt about it.  I\u2019m scared that it\u2019s probably not in my hands or it\u2019s equally in your hands as well as in mine; so I can\u2019t do anything to force it. I can\u2019t wait for it. I just can\u2019t do anything about it except let it go, which doesn\u2019t work because of the first thing, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">is that it\u2019s too important.  (pause) And that\u2019s scary that I can\u2019t let it go. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s more than a hug.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s more than a hug?

Or because I can\u2019t let it go, you think there is more than the hug?

I mean, in some ways, sure. It\u2019s being close; it\u2019s being held; it\u2019s mutual. It\u2019s out of role.

It\u2019s not as dangerous, because there\u2019s not an I-feel-so-strongly-about-it-and-therefore-it\u2019s-part-of-your-role, which is not how I want it to be here about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: To me there is sense in what you say.  I\u2019ll put it like this and be clear that when one is, like with kids, like when I work with kids, a kid runs over and spontaneously gives you a hug, it makes all the sense in the world that you just do it, you know? So in that sense, I think I get what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">you mean.
