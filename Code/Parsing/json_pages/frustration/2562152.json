It was hard. Grayson had a friend staying over.  It was pretty exhausting \u2013 fun, but exhausting. Fun in the sense of it\u2019s a nice age because he\u2019s not yet a moving target. He\u2019s beginning to be kind of thoughtful, at least you can see the outlines <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">of thoughtfulness or thoughts or whatever, but there is still some parameters that make it unmanageable \u2013 irregularities, I guess. Simplicity, in a logistical sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Like you don\u2019t have to chase him around the house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: He\u2019s not moving around the house. He\u2019s not going to get out of his crib. At least this baby is very regular in his naps and things and his patterns. You know. It\u2019s very clear when he\u2019s tired and it doesn\u2019t last long. The kind of outbreak of distress does not come very long before the actual <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">transition to sleep. But it was a little bit scary.  We had a friend stay over and she didn\u2019t really do much in the end, but it felt [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:08). At any rate, Jennie got home and I really wanted some time to work and I didn\u2019t get a whole lot and I was kind of frustrated with that. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">felt like I had given three days so she could do her thing. We had nice interactions, but there was some friction and it sort of came out a little bit this morning. She woke me twice asking if I could get Grayson and the second time she woke me I had just finally been able to fall asleep a half hour <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">before, after getting up at 4:00.  (pause) (sigh) We were kind of sniping and I\u2019m pretty good about noticing when that\u2019s happening and not going too far with it, but in the end, I told her I felt resentful that she was sort of putting me in a double bind on the one hand, saying, \u201cDo this. I want you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">to be happy. I want you to do x, y and z.\u201d And then getting resentful about it and, moreover, it\u2019s like I\u2019m giving her time and getting time to do this thing, which by our mutual consent we decided to do, and I was feeling grudging, difficult.  She said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m working really hard and I\u2019m not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200155\">enjoying teaching this term and it\u2019s hard for me to be away from Grayson. I feel like you\u2019re doing this thing that is fun, taking care of Grayson, and doing this thing, this creative project which you enjoy. It\u2019s like recreational.\u201d She said recreational. I\u2019m like . . . Anyway. I read something funny <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200156\">about the changing grammar in English which, after the Frank Zappa album, Valley Girl, came to designate a kind of internal quotation marks. It\u2019s like a new phenomenon. It never existed before. \u201cI\u2019m like . . .\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Like is the phenomenon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right. I guess you could use it in the third person, too. She was like such-and-such. (sigh) (pause) Whatever. The tension, I\u2019m aware of it and I think both of us felt better for just kind of saying these things out loud rather than being stressed about them. It was good in the end. There is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">a tension and the tension will go away as soon as I have a job. Then I\u2019ll have this time and it will be fine. Until then, it\u2019s going to be stressful and until Jennie feels like I\u2019m really looking for a job and is not stressed about my ability to exist within the [quotidian] (ph?) work-a-day world, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">think it\u2019s going to be a lot harder.  So that\u2019s the bottom line from my point of view. (pause) I have some control over managing the tension and we\u2019re doing it and it\u2019s understood that it\u2019s a process that is difficult for me. I\u2019ve been grappling with it, but it\u2019s going to be a lot harder until I make <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">some progress with that. (pause)  It\u2019s that presentation weirdly in the context of our interaction sort of displaces some of my responsibility onto you or onto this process, which freights this process a lot, this therapeutic endeavor. (pause) It\u2019s stressful enough that, for example, I have no idea <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">what we talked about on Tuesday (chuckles) \u2013 probably this or something in this quadrant.  (pause) The last thing I\u2019ll say \u2013 sorry, I\u2019m free associating here .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562152\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) No need to apologize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. Exactly. It\u2019s a little bit paradoxical in a sense that in order to make progress with this project which, in some sense, is at least parallel to our project here, I need to make progress with our project.  There is a kind of bootstrap issues going on there. In other words, to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">extent that there is overlap between what I would like to do that Jennie is impatient with \u2013 and, frankly, she\u2019s impatient at this point both with the therapy, I think, and with the more creative iteration of it \u2013 in order to create the space in our household where I can undertake it with some sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">of ease or absence of anxiety, I actually have to make progress, to the point of doing the things that have been very difficult for me to this point.  Do you see what I\u2019m saying? Looking for work, finding jobs, feeling at home on the steps of the library. I guess that\u2019s always the way it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yep. I think so. I think you come right up to the edge of talking about applying and then you feel . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: You mean in the abstract? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: No, I mean like right here, three minutes ago, in terms of the content of what you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019m skirting the actual content?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Not even so much that you are headed right at it. You started out by talking about Jennie being gone for the weekend and how it was hard. You felt alone and it was stressful and a little scary and then she came back; and you guys had some nice interactions, but were also sniping at each other. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">You aired some stuff a bit and some of it was about you getting to do the fun things while she is unhappy at teaching this class.  Then you kind of started talking about how really she\u2019ll only feel more settled when she sees you actually looking for work. But that took hold and you really need this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">process for that and this was kind of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I don\u2019t think I said that. Maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying I didn\u2019t say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I guess you talked about this process being freighted with that, with the weight of that. That\u2019s one of the reasons you\u2019re here.  I\u2019m just saying let\u2019s look where you\u2019re marching and what\u2019s going on and while you\u2019re marching, you\u2019re going through the vicissitudes of the ways in which she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">is and isn\u2019t there for you. Then you get to this point where you\u2019re like \u2013 \u201cReally, okay, essentially to make things work I\u2019ve got to start looking for work or I\u2019ve got to be able to do that or something like that.\u201d Then you sort of stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562152\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: In general or in our conversation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yes, today. The way you\u2019re going, it looks like the next thing you might wonder about is what\u2019s making that so hard right now. \u201cI wonder why I\u2019m not looking through listings\u201d or \u201cI guess the first thing I have to do is really update my resume.\u201d  Where you go instead is to start to talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">the relation between that and this process and then to your having forgotten what we talked about on Tuesday and I guess the whole thing kind of seems to me like there is something about that anxiety where you then feel very much alone and like you forget what we talked about. You feel for a moment <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">like you\u2019ve kind of shifted it over onto me.  There is some kind of distance, I think, you feel there. The image that comes to mind is like somebody walking up onto a high dive, getting to the edge of the board and then kind of realizing they\u2019re up there all by themselves and getting anxious, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">sounds like maybe in some ways a little how it felt at moments with Grayson this weekend. I don\u2019t mean that you couldn\u2019t handle it or didn\u2019t handle it well. There was just some feeling in me about yourself of being scared about what you had to do in some fashion. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: That sounds plausible. (sighs) (long pause)  I feel out of . . . out of . . . (pause) The image that\u2019s in my head is of a gear that just isn\u2019t meshing with the other cogs. It\u2019s just loose, which means that it doesn\u2019t engage with anything.  It\u2019s very hard for me to respond to people on the e-mail <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">and I don\u2019t feel particularly depressed, per se, in the sense of it\u2019s not hard for me to clean the house and it\u2019s not hard for me to shower and it\u2019s not hard for me to take care of Grayson at all. I\u2019m very engaged in this thing. I have difficulty interacting with people in general. But with regard to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">work, as an abstraction, as you said a moment ago, as a series of doubts, (sigh) I feel \u2013 and not just work in the sense of particular relationships that touch on work, I have difficulty responding to so that old friends who write to me, I have some inhibition to responding.  I don\u2019t know. Whether I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200313\">feel ashamed of this difficulty that I\u2019m having, I\u2019m having difficulty. I think this is part of the same phenomenon. I\u2019m having difficulty doing the thank-you notes for presents to Grayson. There is a several months\u2019 grace period on it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge deal, but I can see I\u2019ve got a difficulty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200314\">engaging with them in ways that . . . For example, I\u2019m not having difficulty engaging with the plotting and writing of the novel.  I\u2019m not having difficulty in my interactions with Jennie, defending that time. It\u2019s challenging and involves some energy. It\u2019s like one has a finite supply of energy for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200315\">all things, including interactions with one\u2019s significant other. I\u2019m really investing that energy that I have in this task, and yet these other tasks, some of which are only vaguely \u2013 or not even vaguely, as I say with regard to the thank-you notes \u2013 work related, I can\u2019t engage with them.  Again, it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200316\">feels like a slipped gear. I imagine myself as a slipped gear, is more precise, if I\u2019m defining the analogy. I have some vague intuitions about it, I guess. I\u2019m starting to see it. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562152\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: I imagine that\u2019s also reflective of some feeling, of a way that you and I aren\u2019t meshing in talking about your work, per se, or applying to jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: We aren\u2019t meshing?

We\u2019re not engaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Because you\u2019re saying something and I\u2019m not getting it? Or because we\u2019re not producing the desired result?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: What I have in mind is your experience. I\u2019m not sure how that is transpiring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: My experience is discontinuous. If that\u2019s what you mean, then that is a proposition that I can very wholeheartedly endorse.  The discontinuity of my experience is a consistent feature, so that\u2019s a slightly different analogy. There is just something missing. I don\u2019t know. I feel a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">. . . (pause) It\u2019s like there is a level of consciousness that is usual and required for pursuit of all of these things and hum-drum daily life that I\u2019m not getting. I\u2019m getting some things. I\u2019m washing all the bottles. I\u2019m putting them through the sterilizer and doing the laundry. I\u2019m wiping Isaac\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">ass. Isaac \u2013 interesting. Grayson\u2019s ass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Who is Isaac? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Isaac is my nephew. Not a very interesting Freudian slip. I\u2019m doing the things with my son that he needs and that I need at some level. My mother, when she came she talked about how important this was for her as a kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 re-do, revisitation of things that were troubling for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">her. When she was the mother, she said that to me. We talked about this. In some personal, psychic way, selfish way, I guess I feel some analogous sensation in a much simpler or in a way that\u2019s less troubling to me and more just the natural order of the turning of the generations.  You know, you see <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">some things that were troubling to you in your childhood and you want to do better for your child. It doesn\u2019t seem too problematic. But I\u2019m doing them. I don\u2019t have difficulty with them. I\u2019m not inattentive. I don\u2019t leave Grayson on the changing table where he can fall down. It\u2019s very important to me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200453\">that this is the case. I think I might have worried about it, but the discontinuity is not a kind of cognitive defect, per se.  There is some context to it. There is some specificity to the kinds of situations in relation to which it\u2019s deployed. By that same token, where it is deployed I\u2019m kind of at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200454\">a loss. (pause) I\u2019m relieved by the contingency. I\u2019m relieved by it and, I guess at some level, encouraged by it. Maybe one of the important observations to be made is that naturally I gravitate to areas where it doesn\u2019t exist and that\u2019s part of the problem with this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: I think there is something else there which is implied in what you said, but I think also important in its own right, which is that in and of themselves the experiences that you\u2019re talking about are really nice. In other words, you\u2019re relieved that the discontinuity doesn\u2019t affect your taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">care of Grayson. It\u2019s also true that \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying that you love changing every diaper \u2013 but you enjoy it and it\u2019s really gratifying and it\u2019s wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562152\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Changing diapers.

It\u2019s reliable and so I\u2019ve kind of retrenched to the zone of reliability and inversion from that zone is daunting. That makes sense.  It makes sense, but I\u2019m not satisfied with that, I guess. But that does make sense. It\u2019s not very mysterious <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">is what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s not like a conundrum. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: I guess what I have in mind is that there is something very specific about the reassurance that goes along with their reliability and nonthreatening-ness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: Very specific about the reassurance; and that specificity is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: What I have in mind is that I think it is often very importantly very different from how you feel about people in the workplace. When there is trouble, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t feel in it together with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t trust them; it\u2019s not reliable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not solidarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: Okay. Sure.  I have qualities of both for you, I think. On the one hand, in some ways I\u2019m quite regular and reliable and you have a lot of trust in me. In other ways, there are moments when you feel like \u201cwe haven\u2019t fixed it yet\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m still not doing this in the way that I want to and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">we\u2019ve been talking about this for a while.\u201d Stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, there are different kinds of trust, right? There is trust in ends and trust in means, for lack of a better way of putting it. Or trust in the process, the object. So I trust that our interaction will be kind and considerate.  I don\u2019t know that I trust that our interaction will be productive <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">yet. And when there seems to be some urgency with regard to therapeutic outcome or the outcome of the therapeutic interaction, then the latter misgivings become more difficult, more of a problem \u2013 although I know your hypothesis is that it\u2019s less a function of something external and more a function <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">of something internal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: What I also have in mind at the moment is there is probably something unconscious going on with that, too. What I have in mind is when you do and don\u2019t remember what happened in the previous session or kind of where we are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: There is a practicality. There are two things, two aspects to this, one of which is clearly definitively, I would say, ascertained that my mental state or however one wants to put it affects my ability to put these narrative pieces together frequently. It\u2019s very dislocating and is also dislocating <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">when I\u2019m tired. The other thing is just the practical aspects of trying to engage in long-term psychotherapy, where you kind of need to put these things together, at least have access to them.  So not having access to the last few weeks or months in the moment is kind of hard. It\u2019s just practically <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200692\">speaking, if I don\u2019t remember what the train of thought was, it\u2019s tough. Granted there are different layers of consciousness and there are different aspects to the therapy and some of it is interactive and that doesn\u2019t get lost, but all the same I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m likely very unusual in feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200693\">more comfortable when I don\u2019t forget the narrative of what we were talking about or the thread of what we were talking about.  That\u2019s the kind of frame. Otherwise it\u2019s just two guys in comfortable leather chairs in an office building, sitting in the Square, right? What do we have if not the story?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562152\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I guess how I\u2019m thinking about it is \u2013 let\u2019s start by answering your question.  It doesn\u2019t always work like that for people. I think there is something going on for you with the not remembering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Sure. Freely granted. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not important for people in general in psychotherapy to be able to talk about things from one session to the next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. But I think probably it has a lot to do with you feeling very separate or distant from me between sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Well we did miss Thursday, so it was a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: And you were alone over the weekend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: Maybe. Over the last three days of the week, but yeah. (sighs) Not like alone without people, but Jennie was gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: I know. I\u2019m trying to understand. I\u2019m not quibbling with you. Feel free to get impatient, nonetheless. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I guess I do think you have a kind of less reliable, less trustworthy, less present, more abandoning version of me, as well as a more reliable, more trustworthy, more available version.  And I think that it\u2019s like I feel more like that in a way between sessions or there are moments \u2013 there <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">is something going on with that that I think has to do with the forgetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: In other words, when I\u2019ve got the trustworthy Marshall, I remember stuff. And when I\u2019ve got the not-trustworthy Marshall, I don\u2019t remember stuff \u2013 and probably vice versa. In other words, when I don\u2019t remember stuff it\u2019s the not-trustworthy Marshall that comes to mind and right now I\u2019m interacting <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">with the not-trustworthy Marshall and that\u2019s it. Maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I think one piece of evidence in support of that is that so often as we\u2019ve sort of \u2013 not today, at least not yet \u2013 so often as we\u2019ve talked and you\u2019ve started with saying you forget and then we kind of engage around something, it comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Sure, which is to say that my memory for these things is very relational. There is no question that that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: I guess what I have in mind there is that as we are kind of interacting and reconnecting, the trustworthy version comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Or vice versa. As the trustworthy version comes back or as the memory comes back you feel more trustworthy. They\u2019re kind of more intuitive.  I guess all I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s not like a causal relationship. It\u2019s like there are two pieces of the way that I relate to people. So yeah, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">know what to say about it. I guess I can see how that might be unusual. It doesn\u2019t really matter that it\u2019s unusual, except insofar as the . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562152\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: I think it also depends somewhat on what subject we\u2019re talking about. I think when you\u2019re starting to think about work . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Returning to it, resuscitating my capacity for navigating it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: I see what you\u2019re saying. So it\u2019s not your fault? Bad job? It\u2019s unrelated to you really, per se; it\u2019s just that my sense of the people around me becomes attenuated and this feedback loop or kind of complementary process of disengagement is elaborated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">THERAPIST: There may be ways that, in terms of what I\u2019m doing or saying are not implicated or that I have some role that I\u2019m not as clear about, but in part I agree with you. Yes, basically I agree with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">CLIENT: One implication or corollary is that everybody in my life would be attenuated in the same way \u2013 at least everybody who is not four months old. Everybody who I have to engage with in an adult \u2013 that\u2019s not right, \u201cadult\u201d \u2013 but who I have to engage with in the everyday world and the more my interaction <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200911\">with them is defined by work, the more troubling and difficult the interaction becomes. Discontinuous, I guess, the interaction becomes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">THERAPIST: Maybe it goes the other way, too. I remember some things that have happened at work when somebody really proves themselves to be unreliable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">CLIENT: Or seems to be unreliable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yes, or seems to be. We should stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: All right. So Thursday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: Sounds good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
