If I recall where we left off is that you had graduated, gone through those traumatic episodes with your eye, and you had moved back to DC to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">look for a job. Your mother had left and you were a bit apprehensive, so why don\u2019t you take it from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: At that point, I think I mentioned last time, it was almost instantaneous. I think the hard part was just the immediate separation. After that, at that stage I didn\u2019t feel too abandoned.  There was a lot for me to focus on otherwise. I was starting my job, moving into the new apartment, so I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">think just being busy with other things kept my mind off of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You had gotten the job already?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yes. I think she left on the Saturday or the Friday and I was starting on that Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What stands out for you as you think about it? What stands out about what that was like for you, in those early days or weeks starting the job and moving back to DC?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: (pause) At the beginning, I don\u2019t remember too much apprehension, really. I think it was kind of a novelty of being back up there and that was exciting; then I guess the novelty of learning the job and being busy with adjusting to the new job.  At that stage I was living with university friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">of mine in DC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: How many guys were there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Three of us total.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So three in an apartment there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: What was the job like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t my dream job, but as I think I said, it was kind of something to get going. By that point I think I had almost just about gotten over the illusion that my first job wasn\u2019t going to be my dream job, so I think I viewed it as it was. It was something to do between 9:00 and 5:00 that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">allowed me to be up there and have some independence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I know you told me what it was, but refresh my memory about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: It was a company that dealt mostly with publishing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: It was some kind of Internet . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yes, online publishing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Did you have an office? Were you in a cubicle?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: It was open. It was in the old leather district of DC in an old warehouse building, so it was just big and open. We had kind of clusters of tables.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Did you cold-call or did people call in and you were answering?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: You had clients. You would work on a team. You would have your account. I worked under an account manager. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: So he would get the contacts and then you would follow up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: A team would pitch a company an idea and then they would hire us to do their online publishing. Then our company would assign a team of people to work on it and for the duration of the contract that team would carry out, execute, whatever they wanted. We would communicate. We would have weekly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">calls with the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I want to get a clear picture of what you were doing on a typical day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I did a lot with developing content for the online presence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So you weren\u2019t actually having to make contact with the clients? You were developing? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: We had weekly conversations. We would have a call and discuss how things were going with accounts. Obviously, some of them had different hopes for what they would achieve online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess my question was, and I didn\u2019t actually say what I meant, you weren\u2019t actually publishing then, you were developing materials?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: We were acting as their in-house publishing. It was like they were outsourcing their publishing department to us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: All right. Tell me how the story went until the downsizing thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Around late summer it was more like talk around the water cooler that they were going to have to downsize, so a few people at a time would be let go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: How many? This was just months into your getting the job? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I arrived in January and this was in August.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Okay, so it was less than a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) And then the rumors kind of carried around for quite some time and, at that point, in DC most of the leases go from September to September, so at that point I was kind of unsure what type of contract to sign with [electing agent.] (ph?) If I committed for a year, then I was committed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">for a year and if I did lose my position I was kind of like a fish out of water, not having to fork out $700 for an apartment with nothing coming in.  Then eventually things kind of developed in November, shortly before Thanksgiving, I was part of another group of lay-offs for the company. There were <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">a few in Chicago and a couple in DC that they let go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: How did that happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: How was I informed do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I was called into my supervisor\u2019s office. DC had their own managing director of the office. I was called into that office. I think as soon as I was called in, I kind of knew what it was about and she said, \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re going to have to let you go. Some of the clients didn\u2019t sign on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">again.\u201d  This was at a time when people were still cutting back with budgets and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: What year was this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: 2011.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What was your first reaction and what did you experience after that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: It was a bit funny because I remember I think I was more worried about it happening than actually when it happened. I had been so worked up about it actually happening, I think I kind of worried myself out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of anticlimactic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. So when it actually happened it was kind of like, \u201cAll right. Well, that\u2019s that.\u201d  When I heard the words it was still a bit of a shock, but afterwards even my parents commented when I came home, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t seem that bothered by what\u2019s just happened.\u201d I said, \u201cI guess I think I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">just been thinking and worrying about it for so long that when it actually happened . . . \u201c like you said, it was kind of anticlimactic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: You said when you came home. Do you mean you went back to your apartment and called them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes. I was coming home anyway because they told me, I think, the Friday before Thanksgiving week because I was going home the next week anyway. I went home and then I ended up coming back to gather everything together and then I ended up going back for Christmas.  I stayed at home and came back to Tallahassee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: So when you came home to Thanksgiving, what did you experience? What was it like for you from the time you came home for Thanksgiving \u2013 this was right after you had found out \u2013 through the period until you came home again after Christmas? You came home before Christmas.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: That was very short. That was only about a week. I gathered my things together, tied up loose ends in DC, and came back to Tallahassee again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Does anything stand out for you about that week? What you experienced, felt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I think I didn\u2019t really place any focus on thinking what\u2019s going to happen next, as far as looking for another position. At that point, I thought, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll gather myself and then after the Christmas period, refocus on looking for work again.\u201d  At that point, I thought we were entering <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">the Christmas period. It\u2019s unlikely that someone is going to be looking for a full-time position in something like publishing because Christmas is such a busy time for companies like that. They\u2019ve kind of got their pieces in place already. I figured if I\u2019m going to find something I\u2019m going to be more <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">successful once this period is over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: After. It sounds like realistic thinking. During that time, in addition to your starting to plan what you were going to do next, do you recall anything disturbing passing through your mind about this situation? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I think what passed through my mind most was, looking back and thinking, what could I have done or should I have done to ensure it wasn\u2019t me that got laid off? That maybe it was the person sitting next to me? I guess I was rehashing over in my mind what I could have done differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Did you come up with anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Not really. Looking back, I was placed in quite a difficult situation. I was given, I inherited I guess, from people who quit all of a sudden, the largest account that that company had.  For about a month-and-a-half period I didn\u2019t have an account manager. My account manager quit two weeks after <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">I was hired. I was looking back upon that thinking, \u201cWhat could I have done differently in that situation?\u201d but I guess, at the time, I was thinking, \u201cI should have done this. I should have done something differently.\u201d With the benefit of hindsight, I see that it was a difficult and unreasonable situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">to be placed into, to be a couple of months into a job and have the most difficult and important account to be working on by myself. This was my first job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does sound like a difficult situation and, as you said, it was a very tough time economically and there were a lot of people getting laid off, a lot of businesses collapsing. At the same time, you realized that there was still a part of you that felt that maybe there was something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">you could have done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I tend to do that with everything. I always think when something doesn\u2019t go right, if something doesn\u2019t go how I planned or I hoped it would go, it\u2019s something I did wrong or something I could have done differently \u2013 a mistake that I made, a wrong decision that I made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s pretty common, characteristic of you, to blame yourself when something goes wrong or think that there was something that you didn\u2019t do or should have done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Can you think of other examples? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: (pause) Even when I had gone to Europe. to look for work, when I would be unsuccessful at an interview or anything, I would think, \u201cNow what did I do wrong that they didn\u2019t hire me?\u201d instead of thinking, \u201cI probably just interviewed for a job where 50 other people have interviewed, probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">some of them with much more experience than me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Does that tend to be your reflexive reaction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Is to think that I did something wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It is. Why do you think that is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: (pause) I think it\u2019s because I kind of have an expectation of myself that I should succeed at something.  If I go for something I expect myself to succeed at it and if I don\u2019t, I look for things. My first instinct is to kind of look at myself and look internally and think, \u201cWhat did I do wrong <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">that that was not a successful outcome?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Is there a particular feeling, state, emotional experience that you have that tends to go along with that first reflexive reaction? What did I do wrong? What could I have done differently? Better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I think just frustration at myself. Why didn\u2019t this go how I wanted it to go? Again, just getting irritated at myself by thinking, \u201cYou should have done something differently. Obviously, if you didn\u2019t get it it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t do something right.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: So frustrated and irritated with yourself? You are a big disappointment to yourself at that moment. Having positive expectations of achieving something like you go for a job interview and you get this job, that sounds reasonable. I think to be successful you have to have some confidence in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">yourself. What\u2019s not so clear, what\u2019s not so obvious, is why your first reaction \u2013 if I\u2019m hearing you right, it\u2019s almost always or always if things don\u2019t turn out the way you hoped \u2013 your first reaction is to always blame yourself, to be frustrated and irritated and disappointed with yourself. You should <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200952\">have done better. You could have done something better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m certainly someone who prefers to be in control of my own situations and I think it might be a coping mechanism to think that if it\u2019s something that I can look at myself and say \u201cthis was in my control\u201d I think I feel better; rather than thinking me being successful or not successful <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">was, to a large extent, not within my control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I can see where that might be helpful, except that it\u2019s in your control and, if I\u2019m hearing you right, you see the opportunity to have some control over the situation, but you fail.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: If I can pinpoint something that I could have done differently, then it\u2019s something that I can look at and say, \u201cWell, because I didn\u2019t do this, that\u2019s why,\u201d as opposed to \u201cbecause there was somebody better qualified or somebody had more experience.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: How often does that way of looking at something that didn\u2019t turn out the way you wanted, how often does that way of looking at it \u201cthere is something that I could have done better,\u201d how often does that help you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: I think it hasn\u2019t too much. In terms of looking and thinking, \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d I do think it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing less of, the more I\u2019ve done it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Wait, I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done less of, the more recent interviews I\u2019ve gone on and maybe haven\u2019t been successful. I\u2019ve done it less because I think probably the experience of \u201cit didn\u2019t help you before\u201d and maybe come into the realization that maybe sometimes it\u2019s not a personal thing on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">you. They\u2019re looking at 50 or 100 candidates and you\u2019re one person. I think the wake-up call for that was I was sitting in a waiting room for a position that was an entry-level position and I was talking to the guy next to me and he was interviewing for the same position.  It was at a publishing company <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A32\">and he had ten years. He had worked with [] for ten years and was laid off. He was interviewing for this entry-level position; and there I was with one year\u2019s experience, interviewing for the same position. So to a smaller extent, I don\u2019t do it as much. There is a part of me that always probably will <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A33\">look internally and say what things could I do differently or what could I do differently, but I think more recently I\u2019m not so caught up in it\u2019s something that I did wrong. I\u2019m better at accepting that some things are just \u2013 the guy sitting next to me was more likely to get the position because he <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A34\">has nine additional years of work experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So that was a kind of realization that times are tough. How has that been since you doing that less, when you\u2019re disappointed about something and you\u2019re not as often blaming yourself, does that leave you feeling any differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I think I probably take rejection a bit better, but I also think to an extent that as long as it\u2019s not too much, it is helpful and to a small extent it is a good thing. I do look internally and am constantly trying to think \u201creview the situation. What did I do? What could I do next time?\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">think what I\u2019ve done more now, whereas in the past I was thinking too much about what I could have done differently that time, I\u2019m changing that conversation in my head to, \u201cOkay, I didn\u2019t get that, but what can I do differently the next time?\u201d  I think I was too caught up on not getting the last position, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">as opposed to using that to my benefit to try and catch the next one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: That, I think, is a real important distinction, that it\u2019s one thing if a situation doesn\u2019t work out, to look inside and say, \u201cWhat can I do differently next time?\u201d as a way of learning from a situation, whether or not you had any control over it. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong about this, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">it sounds like what you had been doing is not using a disappointing situation to learn something to plan for the future, but rather just blaming yourself for failing in some way, for not being up to the task, whatever it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yes, that was definitely it. For me, entering the job market and not being successful was really, I guess, the first time I experienced \u2013 major failure is not the correct word \u2013 but a significant failure. Throughout schooling I had done decently well in school and I got into a good university, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">so I never really had experienced failure on a more significant scale before. I think it was difficult for me to experience a job that I thought I really wanted and didn\u2019t get. I immediately thought, \u201cIt\u2019s something you\u2019ve done. What did you do wrong?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that\u2019s just a terribly painful, disorienting, terrible experience to have your first job after all these years of education, where you\u2019re going and starting your career and your first job and it disappears after less than a year. That, I\u2019m sure, has bothered <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">lots and lots of people over the last few years. For you it seems to also have really fueled that vulnerability, that part of you that wasn\u2019t sure whether you could really go out there and do a job. It seems like it really undermined your self-confidence in a major way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: I think because it does seem to be kind of since that time and during that time where my confidence has been shaken. Before I was fine going off to university, going off to DC, but since then I\u2019ve been, like you mentioned, shaken a bit by the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Shaken is, I think, a good way of putting it. Correct me if this doesn\u2019t resonate for you, but it sounds like you\u2019ve got a lot of talent, you\u2019re smart, so you\u2019ve had a lot of successes and you\u2019ve been moving along through your education and doing well, succeeding. But there always was this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">vulnerability, this readiness that if something didn\u2019t go right, to immediately blame yourself and see yourself as a failure and be frustrated and irritated with yourself.  Then this thing happens with the job. It\u2019s a major setback and it really intensified this feeling that somehow you\u2019re not up to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B12\">the task. You\u2019re a big disappointment to yourself, but that vulnerability had always been there. Where do you think it came from? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: I think, again, it comes from how I was brought up. I\u2019ve always been on the cautious and kind of timid side of things. (pause)  I guess I\u2019m not sure where it stems from apart from, as long as I can remember, I just remember being that way. My mom kind of brought up she would say when I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">go to the playground or when I would be playing with friends I would, for the first five minutes or so, kind of stand a little bit back and observe before getting involved and jumping in, kind of surveying the situation. I can\u2019t really pinpoint or think of something that would have initiated or started <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B32\">all of this, but I do recognize that I have, at different stages in my life, see things where I have, for as long as I can remember at least, been more cautions and timid, erred on the side of caution before getting involved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You said you couldn\u2019t think of something in particular, but you did think of someone in particular. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I think my mother is \u2013 and I\u2019ve inherited the worrywart character trait from mom. My dad jokes around; my mom\u2019s middle name is Anderson. He says it\u2019s the Anderson way because, apparently, my grandmother was like that. People on my mother\u2019s side are quite like that. He jokes around that it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">the Anderson philosophy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s her maiden name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Expect the worst. Expect the worst.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: How has that worrywart philosophy been manifested with you? In other words, how has she expressed that with regards to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s more the fact that I\u2019ve kind of observed over the years her way of managing was planning everything to a T so her attitude was if I can plan everything precisely, then she could avoid the worst from happening. I think, to an extent, I do the same.  If I plan something and then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">all of a sudden something deviates from that plan, sort of teetering on the path of the worst is happening, as opposed to if it was going according to plan. Nothing is going to go wrong if it\u2019s going according to plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re quick to catastrophize?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Another way in which her worrywart philosophy or attitude may have impacted you is what we were talking about last week when we ended. Remember how we ended last session? We were talking about your relationship with your mother. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: She always jumped in to fix things when things didn\u2019t go right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: The fixer. The fixer. She\u2019s not only a worrywart, she\u2019s a fixer. Do you remember the comment I made? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: About how coming in and fixing things made me think somewhere in the back of my mind that she\u2019s always coming and fixing so I don\u2019t have the ability, if something goes wrong, to fix it myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I suggested that as a possibility. We didn\u2019t know for sure. In light of what we\u2019ve been talking about today, what are your thoughts about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: I think that probably definitely is a lack of confidence in my own ability to manage situations that don\u2019t go how I would like them to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So that resonates for you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yes. I think I view her and my parents as a whole, too much as when something goes wrong I can go back into my shell and everything will be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: She\u2019ll take care of it or they\u2019ll take care of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) I think the past few times I\u2019ve been away from home that\u2019s manifested itself as going out and then, as soon as things don\u2019t go quite right or get difficult, I kind of come back into the safety of home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to have confidence in yourself, especially in the face of something that really shakes your self-confidence like the job loss.  It\u2019s hard to have confidence in yourself and have that attitude of learning from \u201cwhat can I do next time?\u201d when you\u2019re struggling with the feeling that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">\u201cit\u2019s my fault somehow. I\u2019ve failed in some way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: I think the fact that this job was really the first time that I was kind of entering the adult world for real and the first venture I take into that wasn\u2019t a success, I think probably, if anything, it intensified that concern or that idea in the back of my head that I won\u2019t be successful again. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB1\">Should I go back out into the real world?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s very nicely put. It is. It\u2019s your entrance into the adult world and, after you lose the job, there\u2019s a part of you that feels like \u201cI can\u2019t make it in the adult world.\u201d  \u201cI can\u2019t make it without my parents to fix things, support me.\u201d But as you stand back and look at that attitude <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">right now, what\u2019s your . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: With the benefit of hindsight, I do recognize that there were, obviously, a number of things that weren\u2019t in my control at that time, that to a large extent it was an unreasonable burden to place on somebody who had been in the workplace for a couple of months.  Overall, in some ways I\u2019m looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">back and I think it might be a good thing that I didn\u2019t completely succeed in it because I don\u2019t know if I would have had the confidence in myself because I knew that that wasn\u2019t really long term what I wanted to do; but like I said, at the time, it was a job. I don\u2019t know if I would have the confidence, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF2\">if I was still in the job, to say I\u2019ve done this for a while but I know it\u2019s not what I want it to do, so I\u2019m going to leave this and pursue what I actually want to do. I think I might have just ended up continuing down it and just going with it because it\u2019s what I had and it was what I knew.  I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF3\">it would have been easier and more comfortable to stick with it than to pursue another degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: So you feel the danger if you had kept the job is that you might have gotten stuck in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think I would have been the one to say, \u201cOkay, this is definitely not what I want.\u201d I don\u2019t think I would have left and, like I\u2019m doing now, choose to go back into school and pursue another degree for something that longer term I would be more successful at and enjoying more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: A couple of minutes ago we were talking about being at the DC job. You said \u201cif I had succeeded at it.\u201d The implication is that you feel you didn\u2019t succeed at it, even though you were downsized at a time when millions of people were being downsized.  Is there still a part of you that feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">that, somehow, because they called you in to let you go it was because of some failure on your part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: I think there probably still is a part of me that feels I still have the idea in my head that I should have been able to figure out a way to deal with the situation. At the same time, I do recognize that it wasn\u2019t a situation in which success was facilitated.  A lot of what happened kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">precipated (ph) the outcome by getting the largest client, by losing my account manager. I recognize that things were kind of playing against me at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: In other words, given the circumstances, if I\u2019m understanding what you\u2019re implying, both in the company and in the work world at large at that time, that the chances of you being able to keep that job had nothing to do with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Right. Since then I\u2019ve talked with my dad and he keeps saying his career was about 90% being in the right place at the right time.  He said, \u201cYou were just, unfortunately, in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d He said, \u201cAt some point, hopefully it will work out that you are in the right place <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">at the right time and things work out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Do you believe him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: I\u2019m hoping that it will. I\u2019m still a bit skeptical, I guess. Probably the Anderson philosophy still rings very big. If something can go wrong, it probably will, to an extent. I think looking back, I\u2019m in a better position now to look back and think things occurred that there was no way for me <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">to control them or to put me in a good position at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: And this vulnerability that we\u2019ve been talking about today, this proneness to see yourself as having failed in some way, regardless of the circumstances, just think, give more thought to how that influenced you at the time, how it influenced the way you saw things, how it still influences <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">you, even if it\u2019s less. Is it still influencing you and how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: (pause) It definitely still influences me to an extent insofar as I think the experience as a whole was a bit of a shock to my self-confidence. Like I said, it was the first venture out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560766\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: By the way, I think that is an understatement, \u201cit was a bit of a shock.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: Since then I\u2019ve just completely, even more so than I would have before, erred on the side of caution. I think still, in recent decisions, I\u2019ve erred on the side of caution. I\u2019ve kind of taken the easier way out, thinking again to short-term as opposed to thinking that it may be difficult for <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">a period. For example, the university offer that I got for this year and deferring it to next year. To some extent I think that although it would have been very difficult for a short period of time to find housing, to get everything arranged, maybe in the long term that would have been a tenable position <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F72\">or a tenable situation to put myself in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting. Yeah. Do you know if they got your transcript yet? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s the waiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: The bureaucracy takes a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah, apparently.
