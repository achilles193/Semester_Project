At the end in the evening, we had a very tense conversation. I basically said somewhat less eloquently what we had talked about. I quoted our conversation, but the same material.  I don\u2019t know. Neither of us budged <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">very much, although basically what she was saying was that she doesn\u2019t really care about the job. She would just like me to inhabit the role of the primary care giver and she felt like I was avoiding it, which is rather different than the \u201cfuck you\u201d analysis that we had on Tuesday. I don\u2019t know. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">it\u2019s complicated and probably, if everybody had more time right now, we would uncomplicated it right now or try to unravel it. She walked away and I got really mad. It ended very tensely.  I actually was so mad I went out and just ran an errand that had to be done before 5:00. I went to get Grayson\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">birth certificate. Because she took so long with the divorce, we had to do this very complicated legal thing with regards to my paternity. The birth certificate wasn\u2019t filed until the very end of December and apparently because of that, when I went to pick up the birth certificate, they asked me for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">ID because it was a complicated case apparently. I had to go back. It was like 4:41 at that point. I had to walk back to our place and I didn\u2019t have time. Normally when I\u2019m upset I don\u2019t want to drive just for trivial things. We\u2019re fairly close to City Hall.  It would have been hard to make it in time <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D5\">if I hadn\u2019t driven, so I drove. I showed them my ID and they gave me the birth certificate. I drove off and was just sort of pulling in and apparently, just as I pulled out, a school bus put its sign up and started flashing its red lights. There was a cop about a block and a half behind and, from his <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D6\">perspective, it looked like I had passed the school bus. At least, it\u2019s either that or it was the school bus in front of me flashing its lights and I didn\u2019t see it, one of the two, either of which are possible. So the cop pulls me over.  I was very polite and that proved to be decisive because he said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D7\">\u201cWhat are you talking about? The school bus was flashing their lights. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d I was like, \u201cI just didn\u2019t see it.\u201d I gave him my thing and was very cooperative. They ran my license and they came back and I had no citations or anything. He said, \u201cListen, I\u2019ll let you go, but watch it.\u201d So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D8\">I got lucky. It\u2019s about 50-50; that\u2019s exactly what it was. So I drove home and somehow it wasn\u2019t less tense, but I said I would cook dinner because she was doing laundry. She was like, \u201cOkay. Let me finish up the kitchen.\u201d I didn\u2019t talk about that part of the story. I kind of went off a little bit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D9\"> I was pissed and it was tense and it was difficult. She kept on saying she would do all of this stuff on Tuesday evening. She didn\u2019t do any of it. She came to me very tensely at this certain point and said, \u201cI\u2019ve gone to work.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat the fuck? I\u2019m feeling like a domestic. It\u2019s really pissing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D10\">me off.\u201d So she started doing the kitchen. I don\u2019t know. At a certain point I had the baby specifically so that she could do the kitchen and it took her like 45 minutes to soak the dishes and I came back and I was like, \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d She got mad at me for getting mad at her. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D11\">was, I think, shortly before I left the house. Anyway, she finished the kitchen and I cooked dinner and we sat and we had a kind of nice interaction without resolving this conflict.  That was okay, I think, to both of us at a certain level. On other words, we kind of both aired our perspective positions <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D12\">and had resumed the state of mind where we had at least some empathy, even if we couldn\u2019t necessarily . . . I think the key question is going to be whether I get some time to write and do applications and things. That\u2019s really the main practical issue right now. She\u2019s going to have to give on that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D13\">It\u2019s just not viable otherwise. From the perspective of our conversations, it was interesting because I often feel this way, that I\u2019m feeling kind of put upon and it often kind of builds up and I try to orchestrate a confrontation.  I often kind of let it go off without ever thinking about \u2013 I\u2019m thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D14\">about the interaction with Justine, which we\u2019ve talked about and previous interactions as well \u2013 without pushing something that I wished that I would push.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2000C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562150\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20011\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Just making some . . . there is a level of non-satisfaction. I feel like I have difficulty articulating exactly what my grievance is, difficulty getting satisfaction, difficulty getting the other person to acknowledge it, and in a lot of instances, difficulty just saying what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200111\">want to say.  Just in the interest of preserving [shalom bias] (ph?) if you know what I mean, peace in the household, it just won\u2019t happen. It\u2019s like the hoped for intervention will, in one way or another, be unsatisfying. I\u2019m not so sure about this one. I didn\u2019t give and I don\u2019t know whether there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200112\">is positive value in that or not and I don\u2019t know whether a desire not to give is a necessarily constructive kind of principle on which to navigate this particular classic . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20013\">THERAPIST: On what was she pushing you to give? Giving up time to write?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">CLIENT: I think what she wanted at the end of the day, my sense in putting this conversation together with previous ones, that she wants me to say how great it is to have this time to be with my son and not to be working and just to kind of thank her for making it possible and not to want more, not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200151\">to be asking for too much in a way that makes things very difficult for her.  That would be my most empathetic possible reading of her stance. These things are complicated, but that\u2019s what I heard from her yesterday and that\u2019s probably consistent, I think, not necessarily with the tone that she took <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200152\">in our conversations on Friday, but I think there is some of that going on. She wants gratitude and as part of that gratitude she wants me to be modest in my requests. That\u2019s a little bit less empathetic reading of her stance. (laughs)  Anyway, I can appreciate, if not entirely, endorse or agree with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200153\">that perspective. How\u2019s that? (chuckles) (long pause) I can see how it would be more convenient. I can see how she feels a little bit desperate. I can see how she feels sad about being at work.  I can see how she feels a little frustrated about the money issue, although we haven\u2019t had any cash-flow <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200154\">issues because all my tax money has been in the bank, so from a cash-flow perspective until August when my tax deferment runs out, we\u2019re okay cash-flow wise, I just have to plug whatever money we\u2019ve used to make ends meet back into that account then. She\u2019s stressed out about it and I understand why <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200155\">she\u2019s stressed out. Et cetera.  I think she\u2019s not making the kind of effort that I think would be appropriate and helpful to understand where I\u2019m coming from. I think that that particular bit of empathy that I just exhibited is not being reciprocated or I feel unbalanced there and it\u2019s frustrating, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200156\">so I think that would be my grievance at this point but, as I say, I think we both made an effort to kind of recreate a space where that kind of empathy would be easier. It became clear that really being cynical and openly conflictual is not a good strategy for mediating this very understandable and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200157\">not particularly surprising conflict.  Recreating that space seemed more important to us instinctually. It\u2019s not like we discussed it at length, but it seemed more important to us last night than sort of having it out.

Either is perfectly possible and plausible explanation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That seemed to me like the one possible exception and during the conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">CLIENT: On the other hand, he said, \u201cI\u2019m letting you off with a warning.\u201d He ran my Social, so maybe he knows that I\u2019m a new parent or something. He said, \u201cYou were cooperative and you have a clean driving record.\u201d Apparently, I acted like a normal person and not like I was sort of out of it, whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">that means. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: Also, as you\u2019re telling it to me I don\u2019t get the sense of any of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: Sort of distanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: In the sense of a slightly subtle \u2013 I guess trust isn\u2019t quite the right word, but something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: I see what you mean. You mean in our interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Okay. Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I guess so. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: I will say that the conflict with Jennie before we [it\u2019s not reproached a little bit] (ph?) just made this effort was definitely producing \u2013 so something about that conflict in my household was very, very troubling to me and produced this effect and, had we talked while I felt that dissonance, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">likely I would be showing more evidence of the distance that you\u2019re talking about.  The dissonance leads to distance. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a useful observation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: The other thing that struck me, and I don\u2019t know if this is whether this is with her or with you or where it is, is that what she turns out to have been upset about was a bit different from what you had thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what she was articulating anyway. As I say, I think it\u2019s more complicated.  I think \u2013 whatever. Certainly what I was talking about is not something that somebody would admit in the middle of an argument, do you know what I mean? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that my construction was \u2013 maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">it was a little paranoid. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562150\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Maybe it wasn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly. I think there is some of that going on. I still think there is some of that going on, but I also think that creating a kind of empathetic conflict rather than a non-empathetic conflict requires putting that element of the scenario aside because it\u2019s not . . . I\u2019m perfectly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">willing to engage with the scenario that she presented and just to put all of this in the background because I just don\u2019t think it has any productive result.  She did say something that was interesting that I was thinking about afterwards. She and I both take Grayson out sometimes and sometimes we take <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">him out in our favorite bunting. Do you know bunting? It\u2019s like a thick suit, an outside suit. I don\u2019t know what else to call it. Our favorite one is like a polar bear and is all white and is furry and has ears and is very cute. We got it before he was born. We were looking for something else and thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200393\">this was very fun to dress a child up in.  Jennie goes out in this suit and every time she goes out she comes back and says, \u201cEverybody stopped him on the street and said how cute he was.\u201d I go out and I talk to the crossing lady, but nobody says anything. This has happened two or three times and maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200394\">one middle aged woman will come up and say, \u201cThat\u2019s a very cute baby,\u201d but in general that doesn\u2019t happen. This has happened a few times and the dichotomy was very stark and I said, \u201cWhat is it? Is it just that people won\u2019t approach a man with a child and will only approach a woman?\u201d I felt a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200395\">bit embittered by it and I think I may have mentioned it in a way that was similar to the terms that I was talking about being mummified or daddy-ized or something that came up in the course of our conversation.  So yesterday, in the process of engaging in this conflict, granted she said, \u201cYou\u2019re so <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200396\">locked into own your sadness as a stay at home parent, which is not something that I have an objection to, that when you go out you frown at people and they don\u2019t smile at you. You think that they are resenting you and accusing you of being a non-productive, non-breadwinning slacker dad.\u201d (pause) I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200397\">don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to make of the phenomenon. I don\u2019t know what to make of any possible relationship between the complex feelings that I may have about being kind of idled at the moment and the decision to stay at home with Grayson. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Not how I\u2019m hearing it so far. It seems more like if you got the time you wanted to work that you\u2019d be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m totally happy with it. I dig it. I just don\u2019t want it to be the only thing that I\u2019m doing. I want to have something productive in this other sense that comes out of the time that I\u2019m spending at home with him. So no, I totally agree with you. The interesting externalization of our internal <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">household conflict was like okay, here\u2019s the interpretation of our interaction and division of labor and tension over roles as it manifests itself in the broader world.  I agree with you, but I\u2019ve given you all the data so maybe there is some observation bias.

I think you\u2019re eager to be also doing something that is productive in another way, partly because you\u2019re really nervous about not doing something like that; but it\u2019s only in that sense, it seems to me, that you wouldn\u2019t want that go-along, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">as a stay-at-home dad mantle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Anyway. That\u2019s my position.  I guess from that perspective it\u2019s definitely nice to have a reality check and even nicer to have a reality check as far as your own positions in a conflict like this. I guess the most interesting part of this to me is just the handling of conflict. I feel okay about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">this one, I guess. I don\u2019t feel like it was papered over and that I\u2019ve somehow seeded the opportunity or initiative or what have you in resolving what is a very evident thing that we have to resolve. I don\u2019t feel as if I had to kind of knuckle under. I don\u2019t feel as if there was an irreparable breach. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200412\">I didn\u2019t have to leave. I don\u2019t feel actively avoidant, in the sense that that often presents itself as an outcome of these conflicts when they\u2019re not really resolved well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: Part of it is isn\u2019t it like she felt so threatening to you? I mean when you\u2019re in a [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:08) mode, there is somebody that usually feels quite threatening and makes you feel small. [There seems to be more of that] (ph?) in your previous conversation that we talked about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200431\">on Tuesday than in the recent one. Relatedly, I have the sense that you feel here \u2013 maybe I\u2019m wrong \u2013 that she is being more neurotic and [ ] in all of this than you. I\u2019m not saying [ ], I\u2019m saying that it helps you feel a little more at ease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: You mean that this thing that is troubling for me is actually undermining her? I don\u2019t understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: What I mean is it seems to me that you feel that she\u2019s being unfair. She is probably stressed and struggling. She\u2019s paralyzed about not doing work around the house. She seems more overwhelmed and, of course, you don\u2019t like to see her that way. But you\u2019re not feeling those things maybe a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">bit around the application stuff, but not around a lot of the stuff that you\u2019re talking about with her. I get the sense that you feel like not so small, not so threatened, not as though your craziness is going to make it difficult for you to operate or function or do anything you do, like the stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200472\">that you and she were talking about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Maybe there\u2019s some of that. I think you\u2019re right. I think you\u2019re identifying something real and important. I think the circuit breaker, if that\u2019s the right metaphor \u2013 although it\u2019s kind of a paradoxical metaphor as I think about it, because what\u2019s different here is I don\u2019t feel even the risk <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">of abandonment. There are a number of elements of any relationship \u2013 particularly a relationship with a child \u2013 that might contribute to that, so we know there is a circuit breaker in that regard or a non-circuit breaker. In other words, there is a circuit breaker which happens to function paradoxically <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200492\">as an interpersonal anti-circuit breaker.  (chuckles) I\u2019m just saying that the connection holds strong. Also, to use the word circuit breaker when you\u2019re talking about feeling confident in the durability even of a connection even when it\u2019s under conflict. So on the one hand, the conflict feels terrible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200493\">and I think both of us have . . . I told you Jennie\u2019s background, didn\u2019t I? Her parents actually abandoned her when she was 17. They left. Her mother went to the United States, leaving her alone to stay in the house alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562150\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">CLIENT: That was it, you know? Parenting done. Good bye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Her parents had already split up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">CLIENT: Her parents had split up some years before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. So both of us are very troubled by these kinds of conflicts \u2013 I think for reasons that are fairly overlapping \u2013 so it was very troubling for us to be in this sort of non-empathetic space. But at some level, not having an acute fear of there being a schism really, even though at a kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">of effective level that\u2019s what it felt like, function kind of in the way you\u2019re describing. Maybe some elements of that was just the sense that this is bullshit. It\u2019s like there is no reality to this and ultimately reality will have to win out, which I guess \u2013 is that kind of a premise like you were saying? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">THERAPIST: What you\u2019re saying is, I guess, is that it\u2019s more germane that things feel so solid between the two of you right now. You feel so connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. We\u2019re connected by empathy. We\u2019re connected by all of those things. It\u2019s like Grayson is a wonderful child and that has truly brought us very closely together. All children are wonderful, but he\u2019s easy. He\u2019s not colicky; he gets up at 5:45 which \u2013 you know \u2013 (chuckles) we\u2019d like to stretch <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">out a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You sound happy and upbeat and I wonder if there is some relief or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: We almost [rolled] (ph?) right before I came here, so I\u2019m kind of buzzed, I guess. That\u2019s probably part of it. We mutually decided not to go to Jordan this summer, which is a huge relief to me. But the resolution of this conflict, which has definitely been weighing on us for a couple of weeks <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">now . . . That\u2019s funny that I guess I would count as a Freudian slip maybe or wish fulfillment. The experience that conflict is possible without that schism is definitely a relief. I do feel relief in something about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And you said most of what you needed to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how clear I was in the moment. She professed not to really get it, so no.  Ultimately, we have to revisit the conversation, but it\u2019s a process. I feel okay about it being a process, I guess. Maybe we\u2019ll need to get some mediation. Maybe we\u2019ll go back to Elizabeth. I think it will <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">sit okay with me for a little while and we\u2019ll kind of make gestures towards each other. I have the sense that we\u2019ve entered a space where we can make those kinds of gestures on an unofficial basis until we actually have it out with this. (chuckles) The truth is the day [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:43) and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200612\">me getting a job. Once that happens, a lot of this stuff becomes the post-game analysis. We\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Well, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: I feel okay about it. I feel okay about it.  I guess I come back to something that we were talking about, I think last week, which is (pause) (sigh) how to leverage this capacity for management of the uncertainty of being in a space where the connection is uncertain. I\u2019m being redundant.  (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">We were talking about . . . (pause) It\u2019s funny. I\u2019m finding it difficult. I\u2019m talking around something. (pause) We were talking about our interaction, yours and mine, and my hope, wish, expectation, demand, that this be useful for the purpose that I think is most central to this psychotherapeutic interaction, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">which is my struggles in the professional or occupational setting  I think that we were saying that a lot of the difficulty is just how uncertain the relationship is to the other, certainly in the application process, but you made a good point, I think, that it\u2019s not just about that moment, that kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200653\">of initial phase. It\u2019s also uncertainty that\u2019s continuing, even with very old relationships. It\u2019s not as if it goes away, that uncertainty, and that sense of imminent abandonment. So I was saying that that was kind of what I had hoped for and felt a little bit uncertain or frustrated about was the difficulty <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200654\">in having observed that we have done pretty well, you and I, in creating a kind of empathetic space and the difficulty in making it usable in this other domain.  So I would say the same thing about this conflict with Jennie this week. In other words, there is an intimacy there that feels very different, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200655\">although it may, in fact, not be very different from these other professional interactions. Certainly, the reason that I\u2019ve constructed my rather abortive professional strategy around all of these sort of ambiguous relationships, friends\/collegial relationships, is because without that intimacy I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200656\">feel very anxious and challenged.  Somehow I feel like the analogy needs to be effective. Somehow the kind of tension and uncertainty about the durability of the connection that we were able to surmount, mostly just through intimacy, there needs to be an analogous kind of operation in all of these other <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200657\">environments or I\u2019m not going to be able to navigate them. I just don\u2019t see how. I don\u2019t see how the one is transferrable to the other. I see that they could be. I see that there is an analogy there, but I just don\u2019t see how it could be effective and, I guess, as we kind of bring today\u2019s conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200658\">to a close, I guess I\u2019m familiar enough with your M.O. that I\u2019m not asking for a prefabricated, dehydrated version of it that was immediately suitable.  But I struggle with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562150\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">THERAPIST: The uncertainty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: I struggle with the model. There is a logical issue there that seems, even after almost three years of sort of working on it, it seems that I have the capacity to do this. It\u2019s not as if my interpersonality disorder is so acute that I don\u2019t have the capacity to form relationships of this kind, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">for whatever reason. I think there is some plausible hypotheses about the etiology, for whatever reason. It doesn\u2019t transfer it to this occupational domain \u2013 and it needs to. There is a desperate need in our life for this to happen, so I feel challenged by that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: (pause) I\u2019m thinking about this. (long pause)  What I think you\u2019ve been talking about mostly so far today with you and Jennie has been to do with how you are confident in your connection and your confidence in the mutual good will, like what came out in the conversation \u2013 I guess it was last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562150\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D\">CLIENT: It did come out in the conversation last night, the conflictual conversation last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yes. Right. That was what I meant. Okay. Your confidence in the mutual good will that when you guys back off the conflict, that will be nice for a while because you know that\u2019s going to help make us feel better. Clearly, your confidence in those things \u2013 I\u2019m thinking two things about it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F1\">One: It\u2019s really nice that it\u2019s there. It also really coexists with moments increasingly brief with Jennie and the thought with me, as well, I think. Distrust, uncertainty, shutting down, all of that is not gone, but there is less of it and it\u2019s more manageable because there is more of this other stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F2\">\u2013 good will and confidence and so forth \u2013 confidence in that sort of connection.  I\u2019ve seen it first hand with me, but I imagine it\u2019s pretty similar with her, that it took a while to get there and it was kind of through the process of dealing with the bad side of this, like bringing up the worries \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F3\">like our talking about what you worry about, where I was coming from or whether I connected or whether I was going to be able to help. There was this kind of frequent repeated process of talking about all of that stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, like twice a week. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think so. That seemed to help to shift things. I\u2019m aware that, obviously, you can\u2019t do that with your child. But my point is that I don\u2019t think we need a kind of external process or factor to allow us to generalize. I think it\u2019s the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not the same thing. I\u2019m saying that I feel challenged to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: To do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. In other words, if it\u2019s really the same thing, then it just happens, right? (chuckles)  I do take the point but . . . (sighs) It\u2019s not doing so. In other words, it\u2019s not a part of the same action. There is another action that has to take place and right now that action seems impeded and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200791\">a little less than obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Also I think there are ways that the edge of it that comes up in here is that in a way it\u2019s been hard to talk about some of the nuts and bolts of sitting down and getting to the applications. You talked a bit about it, but there is more stuff around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m very happy to talk about the nuts and bolts. That sounds like a very constructive [ ] (inaudible at 00:46:47). All right. I\u2019ll see you next week.
