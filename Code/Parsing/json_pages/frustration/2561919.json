It might have me\u2026 I mean now that the weather\u2019s nice it\u2019s no problem if I have to wait out an extra five, ten minutes, but\u2026 instead of knowing it\u2019s supposed to be there and it\u2019s not there. Just sort of judging by if there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">a lot of people the T\u2019s going to come pretty soon and if\u2026 not\u2026 but so I want to thank you for the book. I read it and\u2026 or not all of it but sections of it, and it was very illuminating because I sort of\u2026 it sort of unveiled two things. One of the things was it was really actually nice because they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">teenagers, and so it made me sort of realize how\u2026 sort of how much\u2026 how far I\u2019ve digressed from, or feeling comfortable with, being sexy, or talking about sex, because they seem quite comfortable with it. And they were 15, 16 year old. [1:10] I\u2019m like whoa, I don\u2019t even know\u2026 I didn\u2019t really figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">out all the facts of life until I was in my 20s. But\u2026 and another thing it unveiled is that I think that\u2026 I sort of see where was the progression of that once sort of I enjoyed sex. Even though it was with the person that I\u2026 a person that I hate, what was\u2026 what happened and what are the things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">led up to that. And what\u2019s preventing me now from talking to Jeremy about incorporating what I used to like, which involved self-stimulation before actual intercourse, and what stops that. And what was in the back of my head was because I read\u2026 it\u2019s ridiculous. I was reading through and then they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D5\">talking about\u2026 even the portion about why to have sex, why not to have sex. And they were talking about the sexually transmitted diseases, and then instantly it was sort of like a portion of my brain was enabled. I thought I had\u2026 it felt to me like I had gotten so much over the germophobia, thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D6\">something was wrong with me, but a light went off in my head and then I read and then I was like oh my goodness, let me read the section on HIV to see if my test at 16, 17 weeks from that hook up I had a while ago. What does that mean and am I good. [2:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: How many years ago was that now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: That was about four years ago. And I realized that after reading on the Internet, some people say to be\u2026 the doctors say that I\u2019ve never had a case of after three months. And I was like okay, I\u2019m after the three months, I\u2019m good. But then I read it\u2019s not conclusive because there\u2019s one in a trillionth\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">and then I realized okay, now I sort of see there\u2019s something in the back of my head. Why I don\u2019t want to touch myself during sexual play and whatnot is because I\u2019m afraid of hurting someone by getting fluid and even touching myself down there before touching other things, touching him, there\u2019s that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">sort of fear that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re still worried about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, I still am. And\u2026 or at least I haven\u2019t addressed it now that I\u2019ve overcome it. So I realize that there\u2019s nothing wrong with just getting a physical at the doctor and just taking one more blood test so that everything\u2019s conclusive. And that way I can actually\u2026 there\u2019s no\u2026 well 17 weeks <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">you should be pretty damn safe. [4:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Well four years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, or four years.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s no symptoms, and you know the person with whom you had contact; he\u2019s not symptomatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: No. And my friend is not worried so I mean it\u2019s just\u2026 there\u2019s all these things that are very logical, but in the same sense I\u2019m clinging on to this one minute a doctor would not say it\u2019s absolutely 100% conclusive. And I realize that this just might be something that\u2026 I mean it comes provided <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">for free from the hospital and if it will really\u2026 and I think it will really just sort of clear up\u2026 there\u2019s always been just this inkling question. And I mean it\u2019s not so much that I\u2019m going to get it now, it\u2019s just\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t have that fear. I can use public restrooms nilly willy and I occasionally <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">accidentally sit in pee and just sort of say eww, that\u2019s gross, sort of get over it and move on. But I think I just realize that there\u2019s still just this\u2026 it\u2019s illogical but in the same sense it\u2019s\u2026 I sort of feel like I just need that validation and that will make me feel better. [5:43] And so later <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">today I\u2019m just going to call up for a physical. And I mean I haven\u2019t had my blood taken to test other things. I\u2019ve sort of been avoiding the doctor because I just don\u2019t like to go. So I mean it\u2019s one of those things I sort of realize that just to sort of really close up that chapter, that hidden fear. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D4\">Illogical as it may be, I just sort of want to be able to just totally dismiss it. And I think that because one time my mom\u2019s like okay, well will another test really cure you or really prove to you. And I\u2026 at the time I was like oh, well, it\u2019s not really necessary, but now I sort of see that maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D5\">it will just really just sort of clear up everything for me because it will be conclusive, four years after the fact. I\u2019m with my partner, hopefully, for life. And then the other thing I sort of saw is that if\u2026 once I sort of\u2026 once I get over that hurdle that I\u2019m not going to hurt anyone by touching <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D6\">myself, then I start\u2026 I need to broach Jeremy because I read in the book it was the sort of\u2026 they had mentioned that the sort of intimacy and sexual play and the goal not being intercourse, the goal is just to have fun. [7:24] I thought well, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had that sort of fun. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D7\">always sort of jumping into intercourse or jumping\u2026 or making it quick and just getting it over with sometimes. And I hate it. And I realize there\u2019s not that sort of time where you sort of are into each other, you can feel\u2026 just have the liberty or the freedom to just touch but not even know where it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D8\">going. It\u2019s usually okay, I know where it\u2019s going, and there\u2019s this pressure to come or\u2026 and I realize that wow, it\u2019s just\u2026 I mean it\u2019s just like how did this turn into\u2026 I mean in part it was maybe because I wasn\u2019t very open about touching myself or didn\u2019t want to because of the previous mentioned reason. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D9\">But\u2026 and so I realize that I mean how\u2026 I started thinking how am I going to implement this sort of discussion with Jeremy to tell him that. I mean I guess implement without hurting anyone\u2019s feelings or just sort of\u2026 because it was in the\u2026 I really liked the comments, the people\u2019s personal comments, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D10\">because they\u2019re like\u2026 because the pressure, it was talking about women when they\u2019re not able to orgasm. And they talked about the reasons, and especially the reason that most\u2026 a majority of women\u2026 or not a majority, a lot of women have difficulty coming during intercourse. [9:11] But also there was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D11\">the pressure, the feeling that you have to come or that\u2026 and the girl was saying that her boyfriend\u2019s asking did you come yet, did you come yet, and she\u2019s like as far as I know. I don\u2019t even know what an orgasm is. And I was like there is this sort of pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It certainly doesn\u2019t help. Doesn\u2019t feel fun. It\u2019s hard to enjoy the process if it\u2019s so goal oriented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I sort of realize this sort of, yeah, I mean a lot of this sort of\u2026 and then there\u2019s a feeling of failure, and I feel\u2026 I do sense\u2026 feel failure and sort of apathy to the whole sex thing because it just\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem fun anymore. It\u2019s not exploring each other and sort of doing what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">feels good because that\u2019s what that book recommended, is it doesn\u2019t\u2026 you don\u2019t always have to come, just do what feels good. But I just sort of realized that that whole part of my brain, that sex can be fun, it can be just about exploring, that it\u2019s not always about intercourse. That part of my brain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200212\">totally just\u2026 it feels\u2026 it just\u2026 there\u2019s no interest or excitement, and I sort of realized that part of that was me trying to destroy that or destroying that with my fear of being infected. And then the other part was just not really talking to Jeremy about it. [10:48] Because I remember in the beginning <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200213\">he was very aggressive and would hold my hand, [inaudible] them together. And actually we kind of\u2026 it wasn\u2019t what I wanted, and eventually it took time for me to express that something soft or that pulling my hair or\u2026 I was like this is\u2026 I was more scared by it. And then it was sort of replaced by\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200214\">I mean just the\u2026 I mean slowly he\u2019s adapting to something that\u2019s more not as aggressive, but still there\u2019s not that sort of tenderness that would\u2026 that just sort of the joy. It\u2019s almost like it feels to me like sort of\u2026 like if I had to name sort of a place or a feeling or emotion, what I would\u2026 what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200215\">I enjoy or what I could imagine is delightful or what would get me going because if you were like in a field with\u2026 and it\u2019s springtime and you\u2019re just looking at each other and stroking each other\u2019s arms or other parts. And it\u2019s not that it leads to anything or just maybe you\u2019re kind of enticed to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200216\">more and more and more because it just feels better and better and better. And I sort of see that right now it feels almost like not The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, that was a little bit too extreme, a little bit too, well\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: Maybe 50 Shades of Grey. [12:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: (laughs) maybe some. Yeah, it just almost feels like it\u2019s just sort of not me being active in the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: It sounds like, and it very well could just be, this is what he thinks you are interested in so that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. He doesn\u2019t know. But I mean I think there\u2019s all different kinds of sex and it\u2019s\u2026 as long as both people are consensual to what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s fine. But it sounds like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">what\u2019s happening is there\u2019s much more of a power dynamic and sort of that where he\u2019s the aggressor and you\u2019re more submissive, and you\u2019re looking for less of a power dynamic experience and more intimacy and romance. And it doesn\u2019t have to be one or the other. But certainly you need your needs also to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">be addressed. Maybe sometimes can be sort of the field of flowers, romantic, soft, loving sexual experience and maybe other times if there\u2019s also\u2026 that you\u2019d feel more comfortable with a more aggressive sexual experience. But I think talking about what your comfort level is, what your boundaries are\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I know it\u2019s hard to get the conversation started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean\u2026 and it\u2019s\u2026 I mean sometimes he makes comments like I know\u2026 it\u2019s like oh, we\u2019re talking about children and stuff and he\u2019s like well, you know we\u2019re going to have to have sex to have babies. And I\u2019m just like well yeah, I mean that\u2019s\u2026 yeah I was like\u2026 I mean I was just sort of like\u2026 I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Does he think you\u2019re not interested at all? [14:11] Are you not interested? It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re not interested at all. It sounds like you\u2019re not interested in the sex that you\u2019re having.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, I would say\u2026 well, and one part\u2026 well I\u2019m not interested in having that type of sex, and I have a hard time getting interested. Or sometimes when Jeremy\u2019s asleep very few nights, when I\u2019m just\u2026 I feel\u2026 and this is one thing that the book was saying, that they said that once you\u2019re with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">a partner, you often feel this feeling that masturbation\u2019s weird. But they said that it\u2019s actually a good thing. And so I\u2019ve been feeling guilty when I do it, especially because it feels so nice. It just, yeah, it\u2019s kind of a guilty pleasure once in a blue moon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: Do you show him what kind of touch feels nice for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: I think I could, and I think he wants to. I mean he wants to rub down there and it just winds up hurting because it\u2019s just very aggressive. [15:21] And I think that\u2019s one thing because I don\u2019t want to tell him no, that\u2019s a bad thing but\u2026 and since sometimes it just starts hurting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Are you using lubrication?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: He\u2019s\u2026 yeah, he uses protection that has lubrication on the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: But if he\u2019s just touching you and manipulating you with his fingers, you might want to get a separate lube for him to use with his fingers so that\u2026 because part of what might be hurting is that the fingers\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of friction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Partly pressure but also friction if it\u2019s\u2026 if you\u2019re not wet enough. And that can become part of the sexual play. Get a glow in the dark lube or if not, get plain. But it\u2019s perfectly okay to use that just for stimulation. And it might help. And then also, I mean it can be part of the play, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">show him exactly what you like with the pressure that you use with your hand. Put his hand over yours. That works. So I think a picture\u2019s worth a thousand words. If you put his hand over your hand so that he can feel what kind of pressure actually feels really good for you. Then you don\u2019t have to say <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F2\">no, that\u2019s too hard, right, which feels\u2026 he might feel criticized. But if you just invite him to see what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not\u2026 you\u2019re not saying you\u2019re doing it wrong, you\u2019re saying hey, this feels\u2026 this works for me. This feels good. [16:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: I think\u2026 and that could probably be encouragement for him.

I think there\u2019s a lot of mysteries that maybe\u2026 a lot of sort of propagation of\u2026 I mean he\u2019s been with other women but I mean maybe they\u2019re different and maybe they\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure bodies are all different. And also if people aren\u2019t honest, you think what you\u2019re doing is working. And if someone hasn\u2019t told you that it\u2019s not, how do you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think I need to\u2026 I think\u2026 because I think just in my head\u2026 sorry, I feel like crying because I just (crying) and I really do feel like that part of me, I want to revive it. I want to be comfortable. Because right now it just sort of feels like sort of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">something you to do appease an angry God. And I want it\u2026 I just sort of want to rediscover what it\u2019s like to have fun. [18:23] Because right now it\u2019s\u2026 or even to put on a sexy bra or lingerie [inaudible] urge, and part of it was that what I thought was sexy, I guess, in the beginning, I sort of look <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200492\">at what is in my past collection maybe was not sexy to Jeremy, or maybe it just\u2026 when I would show pictures of oh, what lingerie\u2026 do you like this, do you like this. No, it\u2019s not too this, it\u2019s not too that. I guess I was searching to what would turn him on and I sort of just got\u2026 sort of gave up on the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: What feels empowering and sexy for you to feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess a lot of this component, I took myself out of it because (crying) I mean I sort of see that a lot of\u2026 I mean in one sense there\u2019s a lot of things I just\u2026 I don\u2019t care about, but the things I do care about I actually have learned to speak up about. Maybe I want to wear this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">or maybe I want to put this on the registry or\u2026 I mean these are little things, but I think with sex it\u2019s very much like it\u2019s still a mystery and I\u2026 the person that I was formerly with, he actually\u2026 he was very perceptive in what felt nice to me, and that\u2026 since he did that in his own head. Now not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">emotionally what was nice to me, but physically he was quite good at figuring that out. [20:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And he was good at reading your signals. And he may have been more comfortable. It sounds like both you and Jeremy are fairly inexperienced before you were with each other. And you\u2019ve gotten kind of scared to talk about what\u2019s happening, so when you\u2019re exploring, if you\u2019re not letting him <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">know what\u2019s happening for you, then you\u2019re not really learning about each other. And you\u2019re so focused on what you think he might like that you might be missing stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s\u2026 and I think, yeah, it\u2019s been a long time since I felt\u2026 a lot of times when I look in the mirror I\u2019m more critical. Oh, there\u2019s a piece of fat here, there\u2019s a piece of\u2026 or not piece of fat but there\u2019s a little chub here. I need to exercise more. I mean it\u2019s very critical. Or it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">looks like there\u2019s a blemish and\u2026 instead of just thinking wow, I look good. [21:21] I see people on Facebook and they have their cleavage boosted up in their mini dress and I just\u2026 instead of thinking oh, what profanity. I\u2019m like wow, what a hot tamale. And then I realize wow, I haven\u2019t put\u2026 thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">about being sexy in that way in a long time. And I think some of it was that Jeremy doesn\u2019t like when I dress sexy going out, and so everything became either tailored or\u2026 and sort of wanting to feel sexy is kind of in the background in my head but it\u2019s sort of a don\u2019t even wear a bandage dress because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200513\">so and so will get the wrong image. It looks like you\u2019re going clubbing. And I sort of think that I really\u2026 I do realize that it tends to be a little more conservative than Florida but\u2026 and this\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re from Florida.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">CLIENT: But I do sense that. I sort of feel that Jeremy\u2019s\u2026 maybe it\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s scared himself of me being\u2026 dressing sexy or dressing non-conservatively, and he\u2019s afraid of what people might think if I dress in a bandage dress. [22:50] Because I mean I have a nice\u2026 it\u2019s a somewhat decent bandage dress. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">Maybe I need to wear tights with it but I mean it\u2019s nothing\u2026 it\u2019s just tight. But I\u2019ve always\u2026 I really like the dress but I haven\u2019t worn it in two, three years, ever since Jeremy went into shock when I wore it without tights. And saying oh, do you really want to wear that or you\u2019re going to be around <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200552\">older people. And I sort of\u2026 I realize that Jeremy likes to control the situation and control feelings. And I think that\u2019s how he reduces stress but in a sense I see that it\u2019s\u2026 I mean even the way I dress\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">THERAPIST: He doesn\u2019t get to control you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I sort of see that a lot of this is\u2026 even whether he likes\u2026 doesn\u2019t like lace or likes lace. But that\u2019s a problem. A lot of lingerie is lace and he doesn\u2019t like lace, and I sort of realize well I like lace. I think it\u2019s very sexy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: What happens if you push back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: You mean wear lace? [23:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Or the dress you picked out or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: Well I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Wear something more Florida.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: Well I think in the beginning he\u2019ll just either say a snarky comment and act sort of weird, and to avoid that I\u2019ve just sort of not done that. And so I think, or at least I perceive him as, I mean he just sort of\u2026 he doesn\u2019t say how beautiful I look, he doesn\u2019t give me compliments. And\u2026 or it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">just feels like ugh, why are you wearing that or really? He\u2019s the kind of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: So beyond not giving compliments, he also makes disparaging remarks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean it\u2019s just\u2026 I mean I remember just recently when we were going to go to my\u2026 to our friend\u2019s birthday party and I was like oh, it\u2019s going to be kind of dressy, I\u2026 how about I wear this bandage dress. [25:04] It\u2019s a nice sort of cocktail dress. And he goes do you really want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">wear that? It\u2019s going to be a more informal sort of event. And I was like well, I was like\u2026 but I was like no, people are usually more dressy at Kylie\u2019s parties. And sure enough, who was wearing a bandage dress was the birthday girl herself, that was showing more cleavage than mine was. I mean she looked <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200692\">cute and hot but I mean\u2026 I said see Jeremy. And he was like well, you never know with these things. And then I\u2026 the whole night I felt really sad that I couldn\u2019t wear my bandage dress, especially if I keep in shape. That\u2019s kind of the point of keeping in shape, is to show off your body. And I mean he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200693\">doesn\u2019t mind my skater dresses, which for a tall girl they tend to be a little bit short, but they have a\u2026 I mean the thing is, is that I think all of this translates into what\u2019s going to make me feel good. I mean mind you, if I was wearing something that was totally indecent, that that would be probably\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200694\">I don\u2019t want that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: But even if that was your choice, you\u2019re an adult and it\u2019s your choice. [26:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think this is translating into my sort of lack of confidence or lack of feeling, lack of, say, in my intimacy and sex life. And I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Kind of the way that your voice feels kind of squashed in choices like what you wear, sometimes what you eat, it also feels like your voice gets squashed in terms of sex. We want you to be able to have a voice in all those places. Or I want you to have a voice in all those places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: No, I want to have a voice because I sort of see that if I don\u2019t have a voice I\u2019m not\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make me happy, and that\u2019s definitely, yeah, I mean\u2026 and I want to get to the point after reading\u2026 I mean the teenagers, gosh I like hearing things from young people because it\u2019s so unfiltered by <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200711\">the sort of demands of an adult, and it\u2019s just very\u2026 they\u2019re like\u2026 sometimes when they talked about masturbation, this girl was saying that I\u2026 whenever I\u2019m feeling sexy I go in and get the job done. And I was just like feeling sexy and getting the job done? She\u2019s 15, how does she feel her thoughts going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200712\">wild and vivid and fantasies. And I\u2019m like fantasies, I don\u2019t have those. And I was like well maybe it\u2019s because\u2026 I mean it\u2019s probably a series of things that now I want to really focus on because I feel that my earlier\u2026 because I did read the section on people that have pressures that they face for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200713\">or against. [28:21] And they mentioned their parents and their religion and\u2026 but\u2026 and I see that these are all contributing factors but I think a large portion is me just not really saying anything or addressing them, just sort of it goes, it goes. Not go. And I think that\u2019s how it was in the past. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200714\">It goes, it goes. Unfortunately, or fortunately, it was\u2026 I was with someone that was able to pick up on physical cues and read things, and it did feel\u2026 I did feel more confident. It was more just two people learning as opposed to Jeremy who\u2019s\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem that he\u2019s much into learning, or maybe scared <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200715\">to learn or not open to talk about it. And instead he sort of says these sort of outward remarks like oh, guess I\u2019m going to take a cold shower tonight. And it really puts a lot of pressure on me because why is this just always what you need, and what about this sort of\u2026 I mean I think it just goes <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200716\">all too quick for me. [29:37] And I sort of see that you have to\u2026 we have a nice dinner, we\u2019re drinking some wine, and then maybe some hugging. All of a sudden\u2026 and pushing into the wall. And I sort of feel like at that point what do I do. Instead of oh, let\u2019s just sort of sit down, snuggle close, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200717\">watch a movie. And we don\u2019t have to\u2026 it\u2019s sort of like we can just, during the movie, just start snuggling and getting closer and closer. And maybe we start kissing during the movie and then the movie\u2026 and that\u2019s sort of what happened in the past relationship, is that there wasn\u2019t this bam, instantly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200718\">we\u2019re going to, it was just more sort of gradual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: You need more foreplay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. There was a lot of that. And even with my first relationship there\u2026 I mean because we didn\u2019t have sex but we did get each other off in other ways, like orally and other sort of foreplay. And I see there\u2019s none of that, really. If anything it\u2019s just\u2026 I mean it\u2019s, yeah, I think that\u2019s what <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200751\">was really cut out from all of it. [30:52] And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: You miss kind of just making out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do. And just sort of not having\u2026 I think that\u2019s the sort of thing\u2026 what goes in my head when we start. Maybe he\u2019ll give me a hug or rub me on the booty and I\u2019ll be like okay, what does he want from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: One exercise that sometimes sex therapists use if they\u2019re working with a couple is to kind of create\u2026 take away the expectation of intercourse by saying okay, you have a homework assignment to fool around and explore sexually, but you\u2019re not allowed to have sex. And you don\u2019t have to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B1\">it off the table forever but what it does is it relieves that expectation so that in your head you\u2019re not thinking oh, is this\u2026 does he want sex. What\u2026 where\u2019s this going. Because you know that, you know what, actually for this amount of days or for on Thursdays or whatever you pick as the time, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B2\">intercourse is off the table. And that means that you get to kind of go back to that stage where maybe there was more just making out or just exploring what felt good on your bodies or just getting a back rub. And being able to really focus on the sensations that you\u2019re having rather than jumping to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B3\">your head wondering what the expectation is next. Because when you jump into your head and think oh, what\u2019s next, you\u2019re no longer experiencing what\u2019s happening in the moment. [32:14] And maybe what\u2019s happening in the moment is really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, actually, and it\u2019s really\u2026 it\u2019s interesting because when I just sort of\u2026 there was a brief time when we start sort of maybe kissing, hugging a little bit, and I\u2019m like this is really nice. And then it jumps into the quick stuff and I\u2019m like no, this is not nice. And I think that\u2019s actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D1\">something I can really\u2026 I mean I think it would be really good to talk to Jeremy about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you can certainly\u2026 and if it helps to start the conversation, share some of what you read. Maybe if he read along with you it would be a way of opening up the conversation. Or you could sort of share hey, my therapist suggested that we have this date night where we\u2019re not allowed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F1\">have sex and do anything else we want. And then it gives\u2026 see what that\u2019s like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, yeah, and I think\u2026 I mean I think he knows something\u2019s up or has been up, or he probably wonders why maybe sex is not\u2026 maybe we\u2019re not as passionate or feeling like that or\u2026 but I really want to talk to him about it. I might wait until\u2026 because, well, I mean the thing is, I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200811\">okay, I\u2019m always going to wait until Jeremy sort of\u2026 when it\u2019s the right time or when Jeremy\u2019s not tired and whatnot, but in a sense I think if it concerns me and it concerns him and the better of us, I think it\u2019s not something I have to wait. Because he had a\u2026 came home from a long trip. He drove to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200812\">Chicago and had to drive back. But it was a business trip. [34:04] But it\u2019s like well I got as much sleep as him, and there\u2019s no reason why I should hold back just because\u2026 and that was another thing that occurred over the past few weeks or two weeks since I last saw you, is that Jeremy\u2019s having a hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200813\">time dealing with work. He\u2019s not getting paid and he\u2019s probably going to go\u2026 miss a second cycle and\u2026 or a four cycle but a second month total of pay. And so things between money\u2026 what I owe him and I mean part of it is we realize that we need to combine a bank account because he gets snippy any time <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200814\">I don\u2019t pay him. But sometimes it\u2019s like well I have other expenses. I\u2019ve got plane tickets and I\u2019m still waiting\u2026 the science department as of now owes me $800. Hopefully I\u2019ll get that check but I mean\u2026 so money has been tight. And so I got irritated because every time I don\u2019t pay him on time or I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200815\">pay him late he gets upset, or if I don\u2019t pay him the full amount because say I have a plane trip, he gets really irritated. And it doesn\u2019t feel like a common pot because he gets irritated. If it\u2019s a common pot it should be understood that I\u2019m contributing all that I can contribute, but if I give you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200816\">more he\u2019s like well what are you doing with the rest of the money. And I\u2019m like well I\u2019m spending it here for the cats, for the wedding or\u2026 and he\u2019s like are you trying to tell me that you\u2019re giving me too much, or he\u2019s like well right now I just\u2026 I was like\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say. [35:41] <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200817\">I\u2019m trying to say that in times of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20083\">THERAPIST: The system isn\u2019t working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20085\">CLIENT: So we\u2019re\u2026 I\u2019m trying\u2026 I think that\u2019s one thing that we probably need to do when he has a work from home day, is set up a common bank account. But I talked to him and I sort of blew up. Well I always say sort of blew up so I have two different things that don\u2019t go together. But I had kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200851\">a\u2026 well I got very annoyed and irritated and\u2026 because when I talk to Jeremy he just sounds so\u2026 he sounds down, depressed, life\u2019s not good. And then I read this news article on BBC that these villagers are\u2026 they\u2019re trying\u2026 they\u2019re having difficulty in not voting because lots of bad things are going on, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200852\">and no one\u2019s addressing those things and\u2026 including their children are getting eaten by wild leopards.

And I mean yeah, there\u2019s boys online <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200853\">and yeah, they can say pretty terrible stuff, but why obsess and why can\u2019t you just ignore them. But with Jeremy it just seems like he\u2019s so down and depressed, and I try so hard to do things his way to make him happy, and it\u2019s just always to me seems like he\u2019s complaining or down or\u2026 and I\u2019m like okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200854\">well maybe it\u2019s just the work situation. [37:15] Maybe he\u2019ll get better. But then I remember the year before when we were in France and he\u2019s like oh, I just don\u2019t want to go back. And he was like oh, I\u2019m just really dreading going back to work. And he was complaining and just life is just so hard to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200855\">live. And I brought that up to him and he was like well, it doesn\u2019t\u2026 he\u2019s like most people feel that way when they\u2019re coming back from a vacation. I was like Jeremy, you were in utter dread and you said that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20087\">THERAPIST: Life is hard to live is pretty extreme.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was like [inaudible] oh, it\u2019s a bummer the vacation\u2019s over but looking forward to the next time, is sort of how I feel. But\u2026 and so he\u2019s like well maybe it\u2019s just a west coast east coast thing. On Seinfeld they always get together and bitch and I\u2019m like\u2026 well I was like but I mean you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200891\">probably just taking me too seriously. And today when\u2026 so we sort of resolved that. It was okay. Then I just need to not be so concerned with how you\u2019re feeling. Great. That\u2019s hard for me to do because I take people seriously, and it is, to a sense, learning different, east coast west coast, but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200892\">like how can I tell the difference between\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561919\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008B\">THERAPIST: When to take him seriously and when not to. Is there a way he can let you know when he really means what he\u2019s saying versus being a little bit dramatic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean\u2026 and in some parts I mean\u2026 because of this, what\u2019s going on with [inaudible] financial, I mean I spend an hour and a half every weekend talking to him, giving him morale speeches. And I told him that he should go to therapy and he\u2019s like what, you think I need to go to therapy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2008D1\">And then he was like\u2026 he didn\u2019t seem very open to it. And I was like well\u2026 I was like because I said you need to learn how to\u2026 ways of distressing. And he\u2019s like<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008F\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s got a lot of work stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20091\">CLIENT: And he\u2019s working on meditation. And I was like okay, what was it, different\u2026 transcendental meditation, a new type of meditation recently. And so I mean he has improved a little bit. I mean he used to be a lot more strung up and he\u2019s learned to cope with a lot more dynamics and work stress, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200911\">but it\u2019s just hard for me because I know that\u2026 what lengths I go to to be a decent, enjoyable person, and sometimes it\u2019s like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20093\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d like him to do some of that work too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, or less\u2026 to be less controlling and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because it has\u2026 how he is has an impact on you.
