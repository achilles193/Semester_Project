data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I guess not too good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve just been really depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: How so? How do you know it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Crying. Really crying, just really being overwhelmed, being exhausted, even though I\u2019m getting eight hours, just feeling like that all day but not wanting to take a nap, just feeling exhausted and not really caring too much about regular meals or anything like that. I\u2019m just feeling overwhelmed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and a bit burned out and instead of going back to that manic phase of getting it done or using that to cope, that\u2019s not happening as much lately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve had to sort of be \u201con\u201d for a long time now and even in the middle of your depression, when push comes to shove about your academics you can rally and get yourself busy; but I wonder if right now without that pressure hanging over you you\u2019re just kind of collapsing into it.  It\u2019s a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">different phase without school calling you out of the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I guess. Tuesday I finally had nowhere to go \u2013 no meetings or anything \u2013 and I cleaned the entire apartment from top to bottom just immaculate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So you did rally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That was all day and I did everything, like I cleaned out the frig, all of it, so I guess it\u2019s a little up and down. Lately in the past couple of days I just can\u2019t even . . . so it\u2019s not so good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Is something happening that\u2019s worse or better or changing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don\u2019t know if you read any of what I sent you, but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I read the first part. I didn\u2019t get to read the whole thing yet, but I will. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: It was just that \u2013 I don\u2019t know why, but something in me yesterday just kind of snapped. I called my sister because I was getting ready to call my mom for Mother\u2019s Day and I just wanted to know how she was doing before I called her. Mother\u2019s Day is always really tough for her because her mother <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">passed away and she doesn\u2019t always want to talk with us as much. (sighs) She was just telling me they finally figured out her plans for coming in this weekend for graduation and I suggested to her that maybe we should change the plan. My sister made reservations for dinner afterwards, which was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">nice of her; a long time ago, actually before my in-laws made their surprise phone call that they were coming. Something in me snapped and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go. I don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d I really especially can\u2019t deal with my in-laws coming and Ivan is still refusing to talk about graduation and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">still won\u2019t make any plans, even though his parents are coming.  He\u2019s still thinking they\u2019re going to be here on Sunday. Everybody is going to be here on Sunday. He\u2019s completely MIA on what we\u2019re going to do with six people and it\u2019s just been really overwhelming for me and I just wish . . . I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200274\">know. For whatever reason it wasn\u2019t like \u201cokay, I\u2019m a little bit frustrated with the situation. It will be okay.\u201d I couldn\u2019t work through it like I have been and I just got to the point where I\u2019m like \u201cyou know what? They have asked maybe twice in two years how school is going and it\u2019s been a five-minute <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200275\">conversation.\u201d Ivan has done his \u201cit\u2019s so hard for me because I flunked out of grad school\u201d thing and has just not been there, not been supportive. I said, \u201cI know this is horrible, but I really don\u2019t feel like going out with them and spending the rest of the day with them and pretending like that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200276\">not the case.\u201d  I guess I also feel really frustrated because the time before last that I spoke with my in-laws and they flipped out about me getting the dental work, my mother-in-law told me how she didn\u2019t<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">BREAK IN TAPE FROM [00:04:10 to 00:07:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Again, fill me in because last week you were describing \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to think if the week has fallen off again. Last week you said the preceding week that he had made a lot of changes. There were as many days where things were totally different and he had fallen back off the wagon from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">the work that he was trying to work on, but that there were some days where he had made dinner, he had cleaned up \u2013 so did that stop?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: That did stop. And something else that I\u2019m ashamed to admit really impacted me more than it should have was Tuesday he was gone most of the day. He had his appointment and he did a couple of other things. I was home alone and I had cleaned the entire apartment top to bottom and I did it all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">on my own.  Over the weekend I had gotten excited the previous weekend because he made a to-do list, which always gets me excited. Sometimes it\u2019s crazy unrealistic, but the fact that he\u2019s doing it is a step, and on it he wrote \u201cclean apartment\u201d and I was like, \u201cOh, my gosh. Were you going to do some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">cleaning this week?\u201d because Ivan usually doesn\u2019t at all unless I ask him something very small and specific; and then that\u2019s a struggle. So it never happened. He never did it. And then Tuesday he came home and I was wearing my gym clothes because I had been cleaning all day and I knew I looked a mess, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">but I had been cleaning all day. He just didn\u2019t have anything to say about the apartment. I had just gathered all the trash, including a bag of trash from the bathroom, and he was like, \u201cThere\u2019s a piece of floss stuck to your foot.\u201d  If it had gone very differently, I might have laughed about it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">it was kind of funny, but in the moment I was just like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding? I have worked my butt off all day and you haven\u2019t even been home. You haven\u2019t helped. You didn\u2019t even do anything over the weekend, and now you have nothing to say about the fact that the apartment is spotless, but you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D5\">going to critique one tiny little . . ?\u201d It was just too much for me and I guess it did trigger in me the classic how many millions of times I\u2019ve cleaned up the house at home and my parents did not say thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: One of the themes that I hear you saying \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we\u2019ve quite talked about, at least we haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if this has come up with Emily or not, but one of the things you\u2019re saying is that there is one set of things you wish Ivan would do that, actually, you wish <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">he would clean. [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:53) you wish he would have just done it. But another set is that okay, Tuesday comes around and he hasn\u2019t done it. You\u2019re frustrated and you do it.  You would still feel better if he could acknowledge that you did it and say thank you and be appreciative. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: And I think that\u2019s, in some ways, what you\u2019re saying to say, \u201cCongratulations. I\u2019m proud of you for finishing school,\u201d appreciating how much work you\u2019ve put in and how hard this has been, what you\u2019ve done to try to get this done. There\u2019s not very much appreciation he shows you for you and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">what you contribute to the relationship and the family and the household.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: I felt bad because, in a way, I maybe set myself up because I didn\u2019t have to clean the entire apartment. I could have sat on my butt all day long. He probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything. He wouldn\u2019t have been like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you clean the apartment?\u201d I could have done that, so I chose that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">I wanted it to be done and I was going to do it. So I feel like, in that way, I did set myself up. But at the same time, he later I talked about this a little bit with Dr. Farrow and he was like, \u201cWell, it was hard for me because I felt bad because I didn\u2019t do it, so I had trouble saying thank you.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\"> I was just like, \u201cThis is so old and I get really angry because I appreciate that that\u2019s a real struggle for him, but at the same time, it\u2019s not rocket science. Just say thank you. You don\u2019t have to make a huge fuss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: This is where I think it might help if you sort of put yourself for a second in his psychological emotional shoes. It\u2019s totally irrational on his part, but if I said to you, \u201cRamona, it\u2019s not rocket science. Just stop cleaning so much,\u201d you know it\u2019s not as easy as that. There are mental <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">psychological investments in being this way that take time to start to peel back and pull back the layers and figure out. Ivan is the same way, right?  It actually isn\u2019t as easy as just telling someone to just quit it. If it were that easy people wouldn\u2019t go to therapy, right? Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s just hard not to take that personally because I didn\u2019t just do it because I let the apartment go during finals, which I felt a tiny bit good about doing, letting it go. It wasn\u2019t just that, but I guess if I came home and someone had done that for me, what a loving, nice thing to do for someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yes. But you don\u2019t live in a place of such profound shame around your incapacity to follow through on things. So when he saw you do that it sounds like \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this excuses it \u2013 but I think there\u2019s a way you think sort of \u201cwhat an idiot he is that he can\u2019t just say thank you.\u201d That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">what he\u2019s working on to be able to say, \u201cSetting my feelings aside that I wish that I had graduated from a Master\u2019s program also, I still think that is so cool and I\u2019m so happy for you and I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d  He has a hard time doing that because he feels so ashamed of his own self. He can\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">muster up the words to show appreciation for that. It sounds like the same thing goes for cleaning the house. He probably walked in and felt so mortified and embarrassed and humiliated that you had done it and he hadn\u2019t, that to say \u201cI appreciate you; thank you for doing this\u201d sort of means labeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B3\">the thing that he didn\u2019t do for him. Again, it\u2019s not an excuse. It doesn\u2019t mean he has to get away with doing that. That\u2019s something he\u2019s got to work on in his therapy, just as it is something you\u2019ve got to work on \u2013 your own self-loathing and the way that you see that as a sign of him not loving you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B4\">or the profound depression that kicks in. It\u2019s not as easy as just saying \u201cquit doing that\u201d or \u201cquit feeling that way.\u201d That\u2019s what he\u2019s working on, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s horrible that I feel exhausted with saying \u201cOkay, I know you\u2019re struggling with it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: \u201cWorking on it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Right. Quite frankly, my entire life my dad\u2019s catch phrase has been \u201cI\u2019m working on it\u201d and I know what that means. It\u2019s not even on the list. It\u2019s not even on his radar and it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love me, but it really, really does suck, quite frankly, to be in a relationship with anyone, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">whether you choose to or whether it\u2019s a biological one, where they tell you how deeply they love you and all of that; and then they\u2019re just not going to show it and you have to accept it. I can\u2019t accept it. I feel incredibly responsible for it. I feel like it\u2019s my fault that he\u2019s this way. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">I\u2019m responsible to fix it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s the part we\u2019ve got to work on in you because you\u2019re not responsible for the separate minds of other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just really hard to look at it and then take a step back and say, \u201cOh, okay. He did not say thank you because . . .\u201d It\u2019s just too much to label it that way all the time.  I don\u2019t have the self \u2013 whatever \u2013 to put that on someone else. I always put it on myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Okay, so just to clarify. I don\u2019t mean you only say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s working on it so I should expect nothing.\u201d I actually think you should have expectations. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to change unless you have certain expectations or a desire to have this change in him. I don\u2019t think you would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">change in some ways unless he said, \u201cRamona, this is what\u2019s in you that\u2019s hurting me about the relationship. Let me put it into words. Let me try to communicate what I\u2019m feeling. I feel like you\u2019re critical.\u201d This is where we just talk about what is the alternative pathway besides hammering into him <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">and then feeling like you have to give up, like \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do here\u201d or \u201cI should just be forgiving and be empathic and let him be this way,\u201d because that\u2019s invalidating to you. Do you know what I mean?  That\u2019s not a solution either to just tell yourself, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just supposed to be more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200473\">patient and more patient and more patient.\u201d We\u2019re working on this. We\u2019ve always said we work on this for a while and see what happens. If six months go by and there\u2019s no change, you start to get a sense that he really is going to be like your parents and it\u2019s never going to change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: I admit this is a problem and I\u2019m not justifying it, but I really am hung up and I really, to this day, in talking to my parents and thinking about their lifestyle, I still have this overwhelming urge \u2013 like if I lived close to them I would go home and I would clean the house and I would coax <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">my dad to come home and take care of his health. And I would coax my mom to not label her staying the house 24-7 as being shy. I feel incredibly responsible. I feel like if they don\u2019t get over those things, I feel like if Ivan doesn\u2019t get over these things, that it\u2019s my fault, that I didn\u2019t do enough. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\"> And when he doesn\u2019t say thank you or he doesn\u2019t pick up after himself or he doesn\u2019t say something nice because I finished grad school, I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s really struggling with some stuff and I need to be patient, I feel like I\u2019m coaxing him to love me and I\u2019m just becoming more and more convinced <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200493\">that he\u2019s in this relationship because he really needs somebody to take care of him and help him through this phase. And maybe, in fact, once he did gain some of those skills initially \u2013 to be a more independent person \u2013 maybe he would look at me and say, \u201cNo, I appreciate you helping me through it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200494\">but I didn\u2019t love you. I needed you and I just . . . \u201c It does not feel good or loving. It just doesn\u2019t most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it feels more like a parent\/child relationship rather than equal peer partner relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s something that I keep trying to bring up in couples and it\u2019s like it\u2019s not getting through. It\u2019s like, if anything, we don\u2019t talk about what\u2019s going on with Ivan, we talk about if I\u2019m being less critical, if I\u2019m treating him less like he needs the help. It\u2019s just maddening to me because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">I don\u2019t feel like the things that I do for him or coax him to do, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing it just because I\u2019m a control freak, although I have some control issues, I feel like there really is a valid basis for saying \u201cit\u2019s really not happening\u201d \u2013 not \u201cit would happen if I could just back off. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">would happen anyway.\u201d I don\u2019t think it would because it\u2019s not happening even when I am on his case. It\u2019s literally driving me crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You sound like you\u2019re in a more stuck place around it this week than last week. Last week you were really making some headway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: I do and I really feel bad about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m still trying to understand \u2013 what happened between last week and this week? Is it that the improvements started not to shine through as much? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s that. I think it just came to a turning point where him not making plans and not talking about graduation this week. For whatever reason, it snapped in me and now I really do need to have plans I place and it\u2019s not in the distance \u2013 and he\u2019s still MIA. I really . . . I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">It snapped and instead of it being about he won\u2019t make plans for one weekend, it\u2019s about he wouldn\u2019t make plans for two years. It\u2019s about he wasn\u2019t supportive for two years. He just wasn\u2019t there, couldn\u2019t get his crap together \u2013 still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: It sort of snowballed into everything about how he\u2019s failed you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: It is and it\u2019s now this resentment of the expectations for what I had for these two years in him are completely not there.  I don\u2019t like being disappointed. It\u2019s not like I feel like I\u2019m looking for him to fail, but he really, really has been so many things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So somehow, Ramona, I just want to observe that rather than it feeling \u2013 last week is one sample week \u2013 it felt like there was some space inside you to sort of start looking at the relationship from this point forward. And I\u2019m just giving you a description of something; there\u2019s no value judgment <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">here. This week it sounds like your mind has moved back to the last two years and you\u2019re feeling very, very stirred by all of the things there are to be angry and resentful about in the last two years. So something has triggered the looking-back anger.  And, again, I say that this doesn\u2019t mean that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B2\">you shouldn\u2019t have that anger, but do you see how there\u2019s something different about keeping the forward momentum and trying to see the changes that have happened since you started the couple\u2019s therapy and individual therapies versus looking back at the last two years.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I guess I feel like I\u2019m coming to the end of the two years of my program and at the end of your degree, don\u2019t you not really look back upon it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good point. You\u2019re in a kind of reflective space about the last two years of your life. The turning point of your life means you look back, which may mean new frustrations<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">BREAK IN TAPE FROM [00:21:43 to 00:26:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: \u201cAre you looking for new jobs?\u201d or \u201chow is it going? How are you feeling? It\u2019s going to be like it\u2019s a fairy tale and they\u2019re going to be like \u201cIvan is so supportive of you. Isn\u2019t this wonderful? How lucky you are.\u201d It\u2019s going to be too much and they\u2019re going to be on me about the job because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">they expect me to earn the money, evidently, and I just can\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: Okay. Take a deep breath for a second. There is a lot of feeling, even talking about it. So much feeling. You used the expression \u201ccutting off your nose to spite your face.\u201d This is a question I have: If you were to cancel the weekend, would you regret it or would you feel like \u201cthat would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">be much better for me. Even three months later I would feel glad that I did that.\u201d  In other words, is it cutting off your nose to spite your face or isn\u2019t it? What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">CLIENT: I would regret it if I didn\u2019t go at all, obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: Didn\u2019t go out to dinner, you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: No, no. I mean if I didn\u2019t go to graduation. I would regret that, but he\u2019s out of it and I\u2019m so ashamed that I said to my sister, \u201cMaybe just you and I could go out with mom and dad Friday night and let that be it.\u201d And then Saturday people can just eat whatever at my apartment. I can cook something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">ahead and that way I get out of the dinner with my in-laws and everybody all at once and, quite frankly, Ivan. I know this is horrible. I know it\u2019s horrible, but I\u2019m just so mad at him right now and I keep telling myself \u201cjust get over it and let it go. Don\u2019t think about it right now.\u201d I can\u2019t. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B2\">so unbelievably, white-knuckle furious with him. I know that\u2019s not healthy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Actually, to me one of the things that it is, is that it\u2019s honing in on where the biggest part of the problem is because, in a way, once you said that \u2013what if you\u2019d had a week this past week where Ivan was really on the ball, really impressing you with the things he was doing?  You might <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D1\">not quite feel this way, I would guess. Is that right? In other words, a lot of people, when they\u2019re mad at their significant other, get mad at their in-laws even more so. It sort of feels like \u201cwhy do I even want to have anything to do with this person?\u201d Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: And I definitely \u2013 this is wrong, too, probably \u2013 but I blame them for his shame because he\u2019s telling me how much they\u2019ve shamed him and the comment thing. I blame them for that. I blame them for him avoiding. I blame them for not acknowledging it right now. I blame them for the times when I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F1\">called my father-in-law and said, \u201cThis is going on with Ivan. I\u2019m so scared,\u201d and he never called me back, didn\u2019t care if I was doing okay. Again, I\u2019m really angry at this, so I\u2019m definitely angry with them because I\u2019m angry with Ivan, but it\u2019s also what they\u2019ve been doing around the issues. I blame <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F2\">them, whether or not that\u2019s right. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s totally, totally right. The problem is \u2013 does acting on that anger with them make things better or worse for you? Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: No, I know it\u2019s not productive. I know it\u2019s not healthy. I know it\u2019s not personal. I feel like a horrible Christian. I feel like a horrible person, in general, because, of course, the reality is . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">THERAPIST: No, no, no. Wait. I want to be clear. I\u2019m not talking about being like \u201cyou need to be a kind person to them because that\u2019s what being a good person is.\u201d I\u2019m actually thinking for a second being selfish for you. What is actually in Ramona\u2019s best interest about navigating this weekend? That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200751\">what I\u2019m interested in right now. So in the moment your emotional mind might say it\u2019s really good for you to tell them to go to hell and get away for the weekend or \u201cI\u2019m canceling dinner.\u201d Your rational mind might say actually, Ramona, that\u2019s not good for you because then it makes things even worse <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200752\">after this weekend is over.  It might mean that then there\u2019s even more tension and the next time it\u2019s harder to see them. You might feel better about the whole thing if you can just suck it up and get through it. And that may be wrong. Maybe your rational mind says they\u2019re such horrible people that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200753\">you don\u2019t ever want to see them again and you have to have the relationship with Ivan, but not them. Do you know what I mean? Is it a time to be politically bite-your-tongue or not? That\u2019s the question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">CLIENT: No, I absolutely have to. My mom has told me . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying you have to, just so you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">CLIENT: No, no. I\u2019m saying that I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m only thinking that it might be helpful for you to do that if it is helpful for you to do that. Do you know what I mean? If six months from now you mean that your relationship is in a better place because you kind of got through the weekend without ruffling too many feathers, then I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D1\">it\u2019s good for you. If in six months you think that makes you feel even worse about yourself that you didn\u2019t stand up for what you believed in and said \u201cI just can\u2019t do this right now,\u201d then I think you should cancel the weekend. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. But the problem is that my mother-in-law wants us both to come to New Orleans two weeks after graduation for a surprise 50th for my father-in-law and Ivan, of course, feels that it\u2019s a family thing and we should both go. We should both go for the whole weekend. Right now we can\u2019t afford <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">it. Things are really, really bad money-wise and I am so sick to death of acknowledging that and dealing with it. I\u2019m like, \u201cMaybe you should go,\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, that would be coffin nails in in our marriage.\u201d I was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d I know that this is also horrible, but I\u2019m still <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F2\">holding a grudge about my father-in-law saying how he is deathly afraid of me. (sighs) And that he thinks I\u2019m so judgmental and harsh about his son. I\u2019m like, \u201cMaybe you should just go by yourself,\u201d because that\u2019s what he wants anyway, most likely. Even if he would be happy if I was there, he\u2019ll be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F3\">fine and we\u2019ll get some space. Whether or not things are going great or lousy, we\u2019ll get some space which \u2013 he\u2019s home all the time because he works until noon or 1:00 three days a week and then just in the evening on Saturday.  So he\u2019s home all the time and I\u2019m not getting any space, especially now <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F4\">that school is done and I\u2019m just dying to get a job. (chuckles) Maybe all of it all together is too much, but still at the end of the day I\u2019m left with \u201cwe need to figure out what to do with your parents on Sunday.\u201d (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">THERAPIST: Would it help if you did one meal with your family and one meal with his, sort of divided it up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">CLIENT: It would, but there\u2019s no way there is a polite . . . because I wish I could just afterwards maybe go to dinner with my parents and Ivan can go out and do something with his parents; but there\u2019s no polite way to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">THERAPIST: I mean Friday night versus Saturday night, doing dinner with one versus the other.

I don\u2019t know why, but I just got so incredibly upset and unbelievably angry <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200871\">with Ivan. And it wasn\u2019t anything that he was doing; it was more like I just felt like he was still absent and I don\u2019t know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">THERAPIST: I really wonder if something got very triggered about your childhood. It\u2019s not that Ivan is not doing things, but there\u2019s something that sounds like it just pushed your rage through the roof, perhaps after this conversation with your mother on Mother\u2019s Day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">CLIENT: Last night when I got home \u2013 I was volunteering at the hospital \u2013 and I got home (sighs) and I was still upset from earlier because I really told Ivan that I was hurt and he just never responded. He still hasn\u2019t responded to it, really.  Eventually he said something like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">earlier;\u201d and that\u2019s like as much as he can do. It was too much for me and I acted like it was somewhat okay. He went to bed because he has to get up really early and I just sat in the living room and sobbed and sobbed and sobbed. He came out and was like, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d He just has a really straight <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B2\">. . . He\u2019s doing the stone face, and I\u2019m like, \u201cNothing. Just go back to bed. I just need some space.\u201d Then the third time he comes out and he wants to sit on the couch by me and I\u2019m just like, \u2018No, just leave it.\u201d He was like, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d He really had no clue. I just know he sees that I am sobbing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B3\">He sees that I am devastated and, for whatever reason, he just wasn\u2019t able to show any compassion. It was just too much for me, like the other times in the week where he\u2019s just gotten to a point where he can\u2019t talk and he just doesn\u2019t even say like \u201cI need a few minutes before we talk;\u201d he just doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B4\">talk.  And I just feel ultimately so rejected and so pathetic because, here I am, almost two years into my marriage, and I\u2019m begging my spouse to talk to me, to look at me, to show me compassion when I am sobbing uncontrollably. It feels like crap. Whether or not that\u2019s reflective of things that he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B5\">struggling with, it still feels like crap.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve been hesitant today to talk about the Dearman skills because, even though that was our agenda, I haven\u2019t had that ready to do; but there\u2019s so much feeling about much bigger, deeper issues right now that it\u2019s sort of not like a calmer place to walk through a new skill. But I do wonder, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D1\">Ramona, how much this set ways of thinking about things could be helpful to you and Ivan, even navigating this weekend. I wonder, for example, if there is a way that you and he could talk about what you are asking for from him that would help you when you\u2019re in a place like that.  Rather than saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D2\">\u201cI just need you to be . . .\u201d or \u201cjust . . .\u201d or \u201cyou do . . .\u201d \u2013 the anger state. Dearman is a skill that allows people . . . Basically it\u2019s interpersonal effective guidelines for getting what you want. So it\u2019s thinking about if there\u2019s something I need to go ask someone for, how do I speak to them <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D3\">in a way that will increase the likelihood that I will actually get what I want. So with Ivan I might say, for example, what do you need from him this week? We can\u2019t affect the long term, but this week in anticipation of this weekend, if you were to think about one thing that would help you get through <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D4\">the weekend . . . One thing that I wonder about, for example, is getting back a little bit on the same page for a week. This is a stressful week for you. I wonder if he knows even how stressful this is for you. Does he appreciate that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think he has a clue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I wonder if, as a starting point, you might be able to think \u201cwhat is my goal?\u201d \u2013 something small, something realistic, something manageable \u2013 not huge \u201cI want him to plan the whole weekend and fix everything having to do with our relationship.\u201d That\u2019s not going to happen; but if <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200911\">there were something small that he could do that would make you feel a little bit better \u2013 like if it ticks your rage down from ten down to eight or from nine down to eight \u2013 what is that one thing that he could do that you could say, \u201cIvan, can I talk to you?\u201d And then you sit down and you walk through <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200912\">the Dearman skills. Dearman is an acronym for Describe, Express, Assert, Reinforce, stay Mindful, Appear confident, and Negotiate. You have that skill sheet that I gave you. It\u2019s a way of being mindful throughout the entire conversation to keep your affect quiet and calm inside. And then you describe <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200913\">what the situation is. You express what your feelings are about the situation and then you assert what you want and you reinforce to him \u2013 where are you going? You\u2019re disappearing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">THERAPIST: No, no. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just wondering. I lost you. It looks like I\u2019m losing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m paying attention. I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not. I\u2019m interested in where you went.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B\">CLIENT: (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m overwhelmed and I got really, really, really depressed last night and I really thought quite a lot about killing myself. I\u2019m not proud of it and I\u2019m ashamed to even say it. I\u2019m having trouble escaping and I even feel like it\u2019s my fault for graduating this weekend because if I wasn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F1\">be creating all these problems and it consistently feels like the only way I can escape all of these problems is if I just disappear somehow because Ivan would be happy. Ivan wouldn\u2019t have all these issues as his parents . . .  I mean, his parents kind of tell me it\u2019s my fault he\u2019s depressed or his <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F2\">dad has alluded to it. And I think of my parents telling me that they stayed together for us and I feel like it\u2019s my fault that they don\u2019t get along and I feel like it\u2019s all my fault and all my responsibility and I just feel like I can\u2019t do anything right. It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s just a dinner. It\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F3\">two days. It\u2019s so stupid and, yet, I just feel like I can\u2019t handle it and I feel like I\u2019m really not okay and I can\u2019t tell anyone in my family that I\u2019m not okay so I feel alone in that. (crying) I don\u2019t know what to do because, like I said, I was just really crying and Ivan was . . . I mean at one point <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F4\">he just pointed his finger at me and said, \u201cYou need to calm down,\u201d and he was angry at me and he was like, \u201cWell, this is your depression. You need to . . .\u201d It\u2019s just like . . . I just . . . (voice breaking) I feel hopeless and I feel like asking Ivan for an expectation for this weekend, my best bet <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F5\">is to have no expectations for him this weekend because I cannot handle getting upset or resentful about one more thing that falls through.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Does he tell you that he loves you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A3\">CLIENT: (sniggers) As he goes out the door sometimes. I don\u2019t think he . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Means it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t feel it. I just don\u2019t understand how you can watch someone sob and sob and just not . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A9\">THERAPIST: He freezes up. The thing is though, Ramona, I think he\u2019d be out of there if he were unattached to you. It would have been easy to make this relationship break off long ago for both of you if you weren\u2019t attached to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yes, but no matter who I was, I don\u2019t think Ivan would ever have the self-esteem to leave. He is attached. He\u2019s very dependent. That\u2019s what worries me. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s here because he actually cares anything about me, but because he\u2019s very dependent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And are you feeling the same thing about your own attachment to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF\">CLIENT: I sometimes wonder if I had a higher self-esteem or if I felt like I deserved more that I would leave him; but even then I don\u2019t know if I could because I still have the hope that things could be better. Sometimes things are a little bit better or maybe I am seeing it through a lens where I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF1\">feel like he doesn\u2019t love me because he\u2019s struggling with these things and really it\u2019s not me and really he can get through it. I have no clue what to think or what to blame it on or pinpoint what the cause of it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B1\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a way, as you talk about this, it\u2019s almost as though your level of your responsibility is as though you feel you\u2019re like God. I don\u2019t mean to be facetious, but the level of what you think is your fault and your responsibility in other people, it is as though you\u2019re describing a god <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B11\">somehow, that you\u2019re the cause of everything, in a way.  I think it would be freeing to you one day to realize these things are not your fault and have nothing to do with your being good or bad. But I also think it will feel very anxiety provoking because, in a way, this fantasy that you are the cause <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B12\">and that your badness is the cause, keeps you feeling in control. Do you remember us talking about that in the past couple of weeks? It\u2019s a fantasy that you grew as a child and that your parents played into in a horribly abusive way by telling you \u201cwe\u2019re staying together just for you.\u201d That\u2019s a horrible <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B13\">thing to say to a child. It does make them feel responsible for everything that\u2019s going on in their parents\u2019 psychic lives and in the parents\u2019 marriage. It\u2019s not your fault. Your parents\u2019 deteriorating marriage and your parents\u2019 psychological problems are not your fault, Ramona. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B3\">CLIENT: I feel like that\u2019s true ultimately, but at the same time I feel like telling someone you\u2019re not responsible for the things they didn\u2019t do \u2013 or telling me I\u2019m not responsible for the things Ivan doesn\u2019t do. It\u2019s like crap, quite frankly. It\u2019s an illusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an illusion that you\u2019re not responsible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B7\">CLIENT: Right. It\u2019s not your problem; it\u2019s their problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B9\">THERAPIST: No, no, no. It does become your problem. I\u2019m not saying that. It absolutely affects you that Ivan can\u2019t do these things, but it doesn\u2019t feel you\u2019re responsible. It was your problem as a child in that it affected you terrible, dramatically. It affected your entire life that they couldn\u2019t do <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200B91\">what they couldn\u2019t do and didn\u2019t do what they didn\u2019t do, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it was your fault.  That is the difference. Those two things have become fused in your mind; that they are one and the same. If it affects you, therefore there must be something you could do differently, right? That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200B92\">not true and I think that fusion of those two things, you thinking of those as identical, is what causes you to feel the most depression in your life and the most suicidal. That\u2019s the kind of thing that\u2019s getting triggered this week, this state of frenzy that \u201cthere has to be something I can do to change <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200B93\">this weekend so that it doesn\u2019t affect me negatively.\u201d And if there\u2019s not something you can do, then you\u2019re a horrible person. It\u2019s not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BB\">This weekend is going to affect you. No matter how it goes this weekend it\u2019s going to affect you and you\u2019re problem going to be coming in here Monday saying \u201cit was awful and let me tell you how it was awful,\u201d right?  I am expecting it\u2019s going to affect you, no matter what. Even if you decide to cancel <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BB1\">the whole thing, then you\u2019ll feel sad. It\u2019s going to affect you, but it\u2019s not your responsibility. The conduct of your parents, the conduct of your in-laws, the conduct of Ivan, is not your responsibility \u2013 it\u2019s theirs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BD\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t make it feel any better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I think it will over time if we can start to pull those two apart. It could actually \u2013 this is where when I say it\u2019s freeing \u2013 there could be ways it could make parts of it feel better because it\u2019s at last free. You don\u2019t have to feel so responsible. There could be parts of it that feel worse <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF1\">because then you start to say, \u201cOh, my God. It\u2019s just that my parents are incompetent people,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s just that they are really this depressed and could not set themselves aside to take care of their own children.\u201d That\u2019s in some ways a more depressing and sad realization about who they are as people <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF2\">than if you blame yourself. \u201cIf only I had done something differently,\u201d then all the fault is yours and you don\u2019t really have to ever get so upset and angry and disappointed in them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100070\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C1\">CLIENT: No, it feels better to turn it inwards and hate myself than it does to hate them.

As a child, you needed to turn it in on yourself in order to survive in your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C5\">CLIENT: I feel like I have to turn it in on myself to survive with Ivan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C7\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on because I don\u2019t actually think that\u2019s good for you or Ivan and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reality of the relationship with him. There\u2019s some headway that\u2019s happening, I think, in the couple\u2019s therapy or moments where I think you\u2019re actually holding him accountable <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C71\">in an adult way that\u2019s not holding your parents accountable, that he rises, then, to the challenge. It\u2019s not always. It\u2019s not across the board because this takes work and effort to try to find a way that you say \u201cI deserve better,\u201d right? You have to feel that you deserve better in order to say, \u201cIvan, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C72\">this is more of what I need,\u201d not from a \u201cTHIS IS WHAT,\u201d you know?  That\u2019s different. That\u2019s your childhood place yelling at your parents. The adult place, for example, this week if he were here I would say, \u201cIvan, this is what Ramona needs \u2013 just to come over and be on her page for one weekend. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C73\">going through a really stressful time and no matter what the two of you are going through, is there a way you could give her a few extra hugs and tell her you love her? Hold her hand, give her a squeeze every now and then through getting through these two dinners?\u201d Just something as little as that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C74\">I bet if he were asked that, not in a \u201ccould you do this\u201d way, but \u201cI need you right now. I love you and I need you. Could you do this with me? Kind of just come over here with me a little bit to help me get through this weekend?\u201d He might be relieved that you\u2019re saying you need him. \u201cThere\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C75\">you imagine I could give you that would help you? I would love to do that for you in this way. And it\u2019s something as little as being supportive and loving? I would love to do that because I can do that. That\u2019s not a lot to ask.\u201d  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C9\">We\u2019ve got to stop.
