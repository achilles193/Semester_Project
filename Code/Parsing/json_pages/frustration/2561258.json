So it doesn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s probably not\u2026 you probably can\u2019t like watch it in the moment. You probably have to order it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I have to\u2026 yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: So right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: So I have to do that and\u2026 yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, you didn\u2019t have enough to do, I know, with finals.

If I had to order it\u2026 and I didn\u2019t check through the QVC if it was there. So I\u2019ll get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019d be interested to hear kind of your thoughts on it and what sort of resonates for you. You\u2019ll like it on multiple levels, I think. Like it and not like it on multiple levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: So yea, we\u2019ll see where that goes. I know that this past week, I\u2019ve just been really in tune with just like the anger. There\u2019s just so much anger there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Wow. Tell me. That\u2019s pretty significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m like\u2026 yea, I\u2019m like... (pause) Maybe a recognition of how I don\u2019t know whatever kind of (pause) ways I\u2019ve tried to like either I don\u2019t know maybe ignore or maybe pretend it\u2019s not there. I\u2019m not sure exactly. It\u2019s like, really? I didn\u2019t think that there was all that anger there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">So it\u2019s like, hmm. So it\u2019s like, well, this is\u2026 so I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet so\u2026 and I\u2019m not a big Hobbit fan and all that kind of thing. But there\u2019s just this sense like, well, the dragon has been laying there dormant for a long time.  It\u2019s not like the dragon went away. It\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561258\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Tell me why anger is so tough for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s just anger. I mean\u2026 but I mean, there\u2019s anger and there\u2019s that sense of loneliness, this sense of disappointment. All those kind of sensations that kind of in my current terminology are all those emotions that really just kind of perpetuate this sense of unsatisfactoriness <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">about life. The Buddhists call it suffering or dukkha. That sense of life is just miserable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">And it\u2019s like so in recognizing, it\u2019s like, well, yea. There\u2019s a sense that I can look at this. I can look at this story right now and I\u2019m like I can kind of cognitively pick this apart. And I can go\u2026 so I\u2019m able to view it at that level. And I can recognize that it\u2019s like this is this whole grand narrative <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">that I\u2019ve created.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the narrative, Seamus?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: About how life should be. How relationships should be. There\u2019s that sense of, I\u2019m not getting the world the way I want it. There\u2019s that, here\u2019s my narrative. Here\u2019s the script. It\u2019s easy to see in relationships and maybe other people\u2019s relationships, but it\u2019s like we both walk onto the stage <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">together and we exchange scripts. And as long as we\u2019re reading off script, life is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: But then we start improvising. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: So when did you start improvising?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, hey, wait a minute. Where\u2019s this part about like, OK. It\u2019s like, all right, all right. The kids start to come. We recognize life is going to be a little tougher and it\u2019s like\u2026 and then like whatever. Then you get the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: \u2026whole chapter about sexual abuse. And it\u2019s like, wait a minute. This wasn\u2019t in my script.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: So now I\u2019m going\u2026 so then it\u2019s like the frustration, the anger, blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me about the anger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: It is (pause) just trying to like be with it and observe what that emotion is feeling like. It\u2019s\u2026 it really is like this being with\u2026 and I\u2019ve had this experience being around children who are just completely irrational.  And it\u2019s just this raw irrationality about them. And it\u2019s like there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">nothing that you\u2019re going to be able to do or say that\u2019s going to change the situation. It\u2019s just like roar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Can you talk about your anger from the point in which you feel it through yourself as the vessel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: (pause) How do I feel it? (pause) I\u2019m not exactly sure where you\u2019re going with that. But just in terms of like a feeling, how do I wear that anger? How do I feel that anger? (pause)  I\u2019m not\u2026 there\u2019s sort of this just kind of this depression kind of a feeling about it. And it\u2019s like I recognize <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">that the two are linked in that probably I switch from anger to depression. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t stay with the anger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: So I slip into this depression, this depressed place. And it\u2019s like, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a lot happening for you right now it seems. Because even as you\u2019re describing your anger which I consider a breakthrough because we kind of danced around it for a while and that was a hard thing to kind of acknowledge. What I see on your face is hurt. It hurt. Anger from being <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">hurt. Somebody runs over my toes with a bike that I\u2019m angry about it. But the deep hurt that you feel that\u2019s where the anger comes from.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561258\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yea. And I think that there\u2019s sort of that sense of like\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Betrayal might be a little bit of a strong word but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: No. Tell me about it if it\u2019s real. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s like wait a minute. And it\u2019s kind of like the being on stage together. It\u2019s like, hey, this is kind of a vulnerable place. We\u2019re on stage together. And it\u2019s like, wait a minute. You\u2019ve taken this play in a completely different direction. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: And you didn\u2019t ask me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yea. And I\u2019m standing up here trying to improvise looking like an idiot or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: But I think it\u2019s not whatever. And in the\u2026 even in the emotional processing of your own feelings, you sort of compared to a toddler who\u2019s irrational, right? Or being on the play and having the script change on you and then you\u2019re the one looking like a fool, right? That somehow your emotions <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">are childish or foolish. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I think that you have never allowed yourself to feel angry. You bury them and that\u2019s when things become depression, right?  But your hurt of years and your sense of betrayal and not having a choice. Or going along or having things change and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200892\">not having the kind of saying something is very real. And if you continue to kind of blow it off and say it\u2019s irrational or you come with analogies to describe it. I mean, sometimes you just feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yea, and it\u2026 and there was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Can you sit with that for a second?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Oh, I was sitting with it all week, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: What triggered it and how do\u2026 what was it like to sit with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Well, I think there\u2019s a lot of triggers. I recognize that sense of a feeling like my life has come to this place of like\u2026 it\u2019s kind of like here is the memo. This is what you\u2019re doing today kind of thing. And I recognize it. It\u2019s like, well, I probably got myself into that place because I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">speak up about that.  It\u2019s like, OK. So I\u2019m just going to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: So that happened this weekend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Oh, yea. I ended up\u2026 and not that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have decided to do this myself, but it\u2019s a different sense of like this is what we\u2019re doing as opposed to would you like to do this? Or maybe we could discuss this? But it\u2019s like, I went to see a concert that my daughter was doing down <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">in three hours south. And then we came up. No, first we\u2026 first I ended up going over to a concert that my nephew was doing over near my hometown or in my hometown. So it was a whole weekend of just being on the road going to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And you didn\u2019t want to do those things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Again, I\u2019m not sure that I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to go do those. It was the resentment of the expectation. This is what we\u2019re going to go do. And it was like, hmm. So I was able to recognize\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: \u2026that that was what was going on. I was unable to know what to do with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: So you kind of sat with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yea. And I just like, OK, yea. And I think that where I am\u2026 where I was able to be was like, OK, I\u2019m feeling the anger. The only thing that I know what to do with this anger is to go to depression. And I started to feel myself slipping in that direction. And then it was like, wow, I have all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">of this anger and resentment and whatnot built up over years. And I\u2019m like, OK, I don\u2019t know what to do with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561258\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: What would you like to do with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: (pause) I\u2019m not 100% sure. I sort of had that image of Wile E.

And what do you fear will happen if you get angry and vent that or speak that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

And that would be what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Well, I think I\u2019m unable to see like this moving in a positive direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: So I can only image, at this point, the negative.

I know the anger is that I can see that the anger is self-directed. It\u2019s easy to be able to project that on somebody else and it\u2019s like this is your fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: But yea, I know it\u2019s\u2026 I know where the fault lies and it\u2019s like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Was it fault?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: \u2026I almost had that sense of\u2026 I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s just this sense of\u2026 I haven\u2019t had the dream in a long time.  But I used to have these dreams but I think it was more back when I was actually teaching I would be in the situation where I would be like confronting somebody. Usually students, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">the problem students\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: \u2026where you were in this highly confrontational situation.

That\u2019s the feeling that I\u2019m having in the dream. So I\u2019m paralyzed. I can\u2019t get my mouth to move and it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">it\u2019s just that frustration\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: \u2026in the dream.

You know what you need to be doing. You know that like saying what you feel here would be really the best thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Why can\u2019t you do that?

I\u2019m sure that even though, at this point, I can\u2019t like say, well, here\u2019s the example. But I\u2019m just like you go back home and I\u2019m almost able to kind of relive or re-see some of my childhood in that my little sister lives across <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">the backyard from my mom and dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Currently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yea.

It\u2019s like, well, go get busy doing something else.

And therefore, it\u2019s like, well, since I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF1\">express myself, I guess we\u2019ll just do what you want to do because I can\u2019t talk to you know.

You can have her say anything you want her to say.  And the initial part is pretty clear. Let\u2019s talk. But what you would say and how you would say it, you got stuck because you\u2019re not sure not how to say it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201731\">but if you want to say anything more than that which I think is not only powerful.

So she has asked if I would come to the choir tonight. And I\u2019m like, yes, I will be there. Then there\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201811\">to be a gathering afterwards at the choir director\u2019s house aka her best friend who they spend all of their time together.

You can say, \u201cYou know what. The alternative, whatever that is. Whatever you\u2026 I think you have a picture in your head <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F1\">of what the alternative is. If it\u2019s divorce and I don\u2019t want that. Or if it\u2019s being lonely although I would argue you\u2019re already lonely, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: But you can change it. You\u2019ve already changed the pattern in some significant ways in a short period of time. And sometimes just recognizing you have a choice, right? Whether you are happy with the way you\u2019re responding or not, recognizing that you\u2019re changing internally and the external <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201931\">changes will take a while to show up.  You can at least be proud of that. But you don\u2019t have to be a Boy Scout because you don\u2019t like it. In some ways, you think it gives you this extra benefit but it\u2019s actually really not as beneficial I think as\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just a pattern at this point. It\u2019s just habitual energy.

Why are you putting yourself through that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yea, I don\u2019t know.

And say, \u201cHon, I\u2019m going to go to support you tonight.

And I\u2019m going to consider that tonight because I feel like that I did it on Tuesday. They had a\u2026 there was another concert. It wasn\u2019t even her concert and I\u2019m like, why did you do this? This was\u2026 I went to the orchestra concert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Are you expecting something back when you do these things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B9\">CLIENT: I think that that could be habitually\u2026 it\u2019s like I think that ship sailed a long time ago. But there is like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB\">THERAPIST: But I wonder if you still hope. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yea. It\u2019s like, well, if I go and maybe she\u2019ll spend time with me. There\u2019s that\u2026 yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">THERAPIST: OK. And to be clear, there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting something back. If I go to the store and pick up beer for my husband, I want something back. Good wife. Yay me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yea, something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">THERAPIST: But the something now that there\u2019s been all these years of silence isn\u2019t clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">THERAPIST: And you are allowed to want something back but you\u2019re going to have to learn to ask for it and to risk not getting it. But I would say it\u2019s less of a risk than you feel is because you\u2019re already not getting it, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Yea. THERAPIST: But my guess isn\u2019t we don\u2019t know this for a fact. You\u2019re not asking and she\u2019s not giving because you miss each other\u2019s signals all the time. So is there a chance? So I guess in the time that we don\u2019t see each other and yay for you for going to India. Have a wonderful <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C91\">time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB\">But I guess I\u2019ll ask you to think about a couple of things. I want you to think about writing the fourth act. Come up with multiple scenarios. You can come up with I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth here a divorce scenario. And you can come up with a\u2026 and this is all fantasy. You can come up <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB1\">with a happily ever after scenario. And you can come up with a realistic scenario. And you can come up with a fantasy, right? And you can rehearse the dialog. It\u2019s your script, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD\">And sort of just instead of putting restrictions on how you think and feel and how you think it might go allow yourself to fantasize about how you think you want it to go. And then maybe the next day you completely change it. But I think it will give us some data about\u2026 because I think you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD1\">if we can just talk now, I\u2019m going to end it because I don\u2019t\u2026 who knows what comes next. But in your fantasy if you are the author of the play and you are then it can end or it can look like however you want it to look. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\">And I just wonder and we don\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019s not receptive at all or maybe she\u2019s locked in the same prison you are and just perceives the whole thing differently, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">CLIENT: Of course, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">THERAPIST: And I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to create that. Like you are two people who want to connect and don\u2019t know how. We don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t know that, right? But I\u2019m\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yea. No, I understand, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">THERAPIST: \u2026saying, if you can allow your mind to go and just imagine what you would want it to be and allow yourself the freedom to imagine what you would want it to be. Everything that you sort of engage in meditation, even the one you attended about presence and mindfulness has to do with being <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D71\">in the moment. This is the theme being in the moment, living with the experience. And this is why I imagine that you\u2019re attracted to these things is the thing that you very much struggle against doing.  It\u2019s like you and the snake again, right? And so being your fantasy, I guess I would encourage <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D72\">you to allow it to be whatever you want it to be or you think you want it to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561258\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">CLIENT: OK.

You are allowed a fantasy life whatever it is, realistic or not. I mean, that\u2019s the point of fantasy. You get to write your own script.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E1\">CLIENT: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">THERAPIST: When do you leave for India?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E5\">CLIENT: Twenty-eight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Have a great time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E9\">CLIENT: Yea.
