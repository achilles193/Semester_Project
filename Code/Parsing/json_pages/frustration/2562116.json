[Pause.] You know when I said the thing about how I stopped seeing you, I might talk less about stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: And he doesn\u2019t like to hear that. That was like really complicated and it\u2019s not at all what I man. But I don\u2019t know what I mean. I think my stopping seeing you and my talking to Jeremy about stuff aren\u2019t really that related. I think what\u2019s bothering me is the difference between me and Jeremy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">And somehow that feels like sometimes it feels like that will go away when you away, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">[03:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">Like somehow that\u2019s easier to come to, like an easier place to come to instead of a much harder place which is dealing with the differences than those or like waiting and hoping for Jeremy to come to some kind of content with his past that helps him. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">He\u2019s really like so ripe for it. I see it like 9 million times a day. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">His struggles are really\u2026I have a lot of pain for him, now in different ways than I had before because he\u2019s\u2026like he\u2019s trying to figure out if he can do well as a musician. And that, like a performing jazz musician in music production. Like making electronic music tracks with lots of real recorded audio <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">also. And then possibly that is really a get-all to becoming a DJ. He\u2019s really really talented, but he, his whole life, has had trouble executing and finishing tasks. And it\u2019s like no different now, but it\u2019s like really really different hurting him because there\u2019s nothing else to blame now. It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">the wrong subject in college. It\u2019s not the wrong deadline. He\u2019s not like paralyzed by anxiety, like in a general way. He can\u2019t finish his projects. And he sort of knows a lot about it. He knows a lot about the process. He can talk about how perfectionism just stalls him in his tracks and he can\u2019t pay <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">attention to the bigger picture of what he really wants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">[07:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">He has like no sense of how long things take and he missed a couple of deadlines for submitting a track to a friend\u2019s record company. And that sort of brought up a lot of harsh realities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: He\u2019s got this like really intense self, like undercurrent. [Pause.] And now like his day job makes him sad many days. But it\u2019s like better than any job he\u2019s had. And that often feeds back and negatively impacts each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">But Jeremy is like so passionate. He like maybe half of the days of the last month, come home from work at like 5:30 and like do whatever he does, start working on music around 9:00, stay up until 3:00 or 4:00 and go to work the next day at 7:00. 7:30. Like half of the days. Fifteen days last month. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">That\u2019s such an intense way of being. It screams like dedication or whatever, calling, obsession, fun, interests; he loves it. He\u2019s like totally\u2026he doesn\u2019t love that schedule, but he\u2019s very happy to be working on music when he does. There are all these little bumps that trip him up. He\u2019s\u2026I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">he could see himself differently and that would help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">[11:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">He\u2019s also got a major hang up about like needing to provide income. That gets in the way of the music after he leaves too. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">Anyway, these are the things that feel ripe for looking at. And it comes up a lot, obviously. I see a lot and I feel bothered by the distance between us.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562116\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s a complex relationship with all the things like, really scared about the idea of having children. All the shame about not working good in his day job, good in his music. How is he ever going to make any money? He wants to make a lot of money. How long do you\u2026? [Pause.] He worries. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">[14:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">But what I say is really really really true. His mom often says the fastest thing that Jeremy has ever done was get born. His dad often says Jeremy has taken two speeds; slow and reverse. It\u2019s really true. He started like\u2026to start to accept the second one. He made up this mantra for himself when he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">having difficult times. Chew slow. [Pause.] Which is a really nice thing to accept. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">[23:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure why\u2026a little bit [inaudible \u2013 23:29]. I just think that\u2026you guess it\u2019s really hard not to want to\u2026 [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine a lot because [inaudible \u2013 25:36] both very painful. And I think, probably also makes you very anxious or uncomfortable to see him struggle in the way you\u2019re talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like the only time that I remember being very very anxious in college. It\u2019s the only times Jeremy was really struggling which was like I don\u2019t know it didn\u2019t seem as often. It was the same like sense of he\u2019s helpless. He\u2019s in like this cycle that feels like it\u2019s going nowhere with repeating <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">painful patterns. In school, it was way worse for a variety of reasons. And then it\u2019s like I\u2019m helpless. It\u2019s really hard to feel positive about anything. And then college, I would be like not be able to see if he had like woken up in the early afternoon. Feel a sense of like of emptiness and loss and fear when\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">Thursday nights, actually, I remember throughout the entire time, he had, he always had stuff to do on Friday, just for like this really painful time. Because like Friday was the beginning of the weekend. It\u2019s always been a hard transition for me. And then like Jeremy wouldn\u2019t be available and he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">probably be sitting in his chair like paralyzed by anxiety and like not start his whatever it was until the wee hours of the morning. And then like not finish it. That happened week after week after week, year after year after year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">[28:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Yeah, I didn\u2019t really know like what it was that I was feeling, I would cry a lot. Yeah, it does make me anxious and uncomfortable. It has for a while. Things are a little different. I feel like there are a lot more down all the time when he\u2019s struggling, but I do feel like a sense of impatience and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">pain. It\u2019s painful. Plus I sort of felt like I had to come to terms; I had to sort of make like a commitment to not to change for me to marry him. So I like sort of did that, with them out loud in that. I don\u2019t know, like what that was, but it was something. It changed the way that I relate to his struggle. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">[30:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">But that sort of thing is not, it\u2019s a nice thing to think about to say, but it\u2019s different. It\u2019s a long journey of really accepting change. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And my parents get wrapped in to it too because they were not like so pleased. I mean my mom wasn\u2019t pleased for a lot of reasons, but she even like when we decided that we wanted to get married, she would say, like that has a lot of problems. It\u2019s going to be really hard. You have to be prepared for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">none of them to change. I\u2019m not sure if that, like what other ways would have been more helpful for her. I don\u2019t know. It seems like there are other ways to say something like that or other ways to deal with\u2026 [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562116\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">My mom has this fear that I saved Ben; like his parents are really lucky that I came along.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: That is an infuriating view. Basically, when she told me that story that she was saying to my dad, like, so I\u2019m saying like Allison saved Jeremy, and my dad looked at her and he was like, Jeremy saved Allison. Yeah, lately it\u2019s been really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s much better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Neither of them is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: But lately it\u2019s been\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: The last one is less infuriating, especially the way your dad meant it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s true. I think over the course of a lifetime we, one of us is saving the other one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess I have a sense that he didn\u2019t necessarily 100% mean exactly that, but he was correcting\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yes, my dad totally\u2026but Jeremy kind of has that view too. Like everybody is just kind of crazy about this. He kind of will say, sometimes I feel as like to me, it helps to think about like times when I really achieved something that I cared a lot about. When I asked Jeremy about that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">the only thing that he\u2019s ever achieved, like the biggest and best achievement was me. It\u2019s really like nothing else. I dig a little and there\u2019s a little bit more in his life that he considers important and significant. I think he really views his life that way. It doesn\u2019t make me feel that great, especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">because I don\u2019t view our relationship like that. I have so many people who are so important to me in such an intense way and they come and go, and like that\u2019s always going to be a part\u2026one of the most meaningful parts of my life. I don\u2019t have that same good review about anybody.
