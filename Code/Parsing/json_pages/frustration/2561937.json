And I don\u2019t use the e-mail. It\u2019s just the server, and it\u2019s double encrypted so Ruth, are you just running away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">MOTHER: Well I have no excuse.

We don\u2019t like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: It happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">MOTHER: Well, not to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It happens.  I had I just about missed an eye appointment the other day, got it on the wrong month. And I don\u2019t know how that could be. And they called me, fortunately, and I got it moved around, but if it hadn\u2019t been for that I was took me until this month to realize what had gone wrong <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">because then the appointment showed up, and I was like what in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">MOTHER: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: So it happens.

Seems like it\u2019s only been about two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">MOTHER: We\u2019ve seen you since then because I\u2019ve talked we\u2019ve talked to you about I after one day of him not being on medicine I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you\u2019re right...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">MOTHER: ...one of us was going to not make it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: ...because I wonder if I have a note misplaced. I\u2019ll have to look. So my gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">MOTHER: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, it was like the second. We were here on the second, Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: See I think every time I start a new year, I have problems misplacing these things. But I\u2019ll find it. All right. So, catch me up folks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">KEVIN: It\u2019s kind of a blur to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">MOTHER: I think kind of one of our deals right now is that he\u2019s just not tolerating the patch at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Oh? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">KEVIN: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">MOTHER: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: In which of the ways do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">MOTHER: Itchy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">KEVIN: Stings too much. It literally stings, so I ended up taking I end up taking it off around sixth hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">MOTHER: Well the other day...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Is that new, because I didn\u2019t think you were having trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">KEVIN: It\u2019s been a long time that I\u2019ve had it, but I just put up with it. But it\u2019s just annoying me now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well that is one of its potential downsides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">MOTHER: And I did some research and called some friends, and there\u2019s wives\u2019 tale kind of remedies that help, and nothing has helped. So I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">FATHER: We\u2019re just having him swallow it now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">MOTHER: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: That\u2019ll do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">MOTHER: So, that\u2019s kind of the newest thing. I think we need to keep looking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">FATHER: It was either that or the forehead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Was it working fine it was working fine except for that, was it not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">KEVIN: I didn\u2019t feel like crap as I usually did with the pill, but I didn\u2019t eat as much.  But then it\u2019d wear off at the end of the day, and then I was really hungry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Now you\u2019ve got to remember that\u2019s not a side effect; that\u2019s the main effect. It\u2019s going to happen no matter what. So you just have to eat anyhow, but so the last thing you were on prior to Concerta or prior to Daytrana was which thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">MOTHER: Focalin. And it we liked that, but then it got to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">KEVIN: I lost weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">MOTHER: It got to where oh, I know. He didn\u2019t he just didn\u2019t like that feeling, the jittery feeling, and then kind of hungry but you\u2019re not hungry kind of feeling. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: You it\u2019s the same medicine. [inaudible] is the same medicine as the Focalin. I don\u2019t have much experience with Focalin. It\u2019s a different all it is, is a different method of getting it in your system.  And for some reason people don\u2019t usually like it very much, so they don\u2019t I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200971\">know why. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s different about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">MOTHER: Well, I shouldn\u2019t admit this to you. Can you arrest people? I actually tried...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">THERAPIST: You gave it a shot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">MOTHER: I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: No, I\u2019m...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">MOTHER: I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: No, I\u2019m serious about that; you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">MOTHER: I did, and I tried it one day and it was awesome, and I was getting stuff done. I got up the next day thinking oh, I\u2019m going to do it again. I\u2019m like I don\u2019t want to feel that again though. Although this was working, there I know exactly what he was talking about. And it is a feeling you feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A51\">every second of every day. And it\u2019s have you ever ODd on caffeine, for instance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">THERAPIST: No, no I drink [inaudible] very careful in my dosing, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">MOTHER: Okay. Well I\u2019ve OD\u2019d on caffeine before and that\u2019s it\u2019s just it\u2019s exactly the same thing. I get it. And I remember waking up that second day thinking well, I have more to do so I\u2019m going to take another one. And then I\u2019m like you know what? I don\u2019t want to feel that again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Well, so let\u2019s let me define your experience a little bit. So first of all, when you\u2019re going at the medicine cold, it the first two or three days are going to be like that. Like my daughter, all she wanted to do was clean the garage the first two or three days. And she\u2019s seven. So it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB1\">was weird. And then that went away, unfortunately, before the garage was clean. So it that is not unusual, but that\u2019s not the effect one is looking for. And it shouldn\u2019t actually last very long after more than two or three days. The second thing, and assuming that it doesn\u2019t last for long, you kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB2\">of have to remember is how when did you first go on medicine?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">KEVIN: I have no clue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">MOTHER: Fourth grade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">KEVIN: Fourth grade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">MOTHER: So that\u2019s four years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Well for you, the experience [inaudible] medicine seems [inaudible] because you\u2019re not used to thinking like the rest of do.  So the I would say that normally, after you\u2019d been on it for a week, but my son doesn\u2019t when he\u2019s off it, it\u2019s very uncomfortable for him because he\u2019s grown up <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B51\">thinking knowing how his brain is supposed to operate, and when it doesn\u2019t operate that way I mean he doesn\u2019t mind being off of it because it\u2019s kind of a random time, but he\u2019s ready to go back on it because that\u2019s the normal way to be for him. That\u2019s why I asked you when you started on it. We\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B52\">pretty good about making sure people because Evan went on it in second grade or no, that isn\u2019t true, he went on it in first grade. So he doesn\u2019t have any conscious memory of being different than that. So that\u2019s part of the experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">MOTHER: May I ask so is he who\u2019s monitoring his medication? Is he going to just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: My guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">MOTHER: Your son.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Well, okay, that is a good question. In the future, it\u2019s kind of like at Disney World. [inaudible] and they have the Epcot in the future, tomorrow, it will be not for my kid, but we\u2019ll have available Olive, who I think is was Olive sitting with you guys one time? No? She\u2019ll she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD1\">a nurse practitioner who will be, when she\u2019s finished with graduate school in December, will be able to prescribe. That will allow us to tailor medicines much more closely. So my kid goes to his primary care physician, both of my kids do, but because never was this intended, but because that person <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD2\">is also works with us in the community with other clients, we have a working relationship.  So if I say hey, I think somebody needs to go up on medicine or something, he assumes I know something about that. So it\u2019s a little odd. That\u2019s how it ought to work. That\u2019s when I say it\u2019s odd, it\u2019s odd in a good way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">MOTHER: Right, right. Kevin is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Gosh, Ruth loves it when boys come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">MOTHER: He\u2019s awesome about I call him, okay, Daytrana\u2019s not now I haven\u2019t called yet, but every time we\u2019ve had a problem he\u2019s been wonderful. He listens to my suggestions. So this is not at all anything about him, but I just wondered whether I just didn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s regardless of who you\u2019re working with, it is an experimental process. And this is the first time I realized you guys were having a problem with Daytrana because I thought he was doing pretty well on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">MOTHER: Well he was and it was a little bit [inaudible] but now he fights me every morning.  No, I shouldn\u2019t say that wasn\u2019t out of the blue. He, every he talks about the itching, and we\u2019ve tried to look figure that out, and we put the KT tape over it so but he\u2019s just recently I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C71\">to do that anymore. I took it off in second hour, that kind of a thing. I\u2019m like $220.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Well this is not oh dear, didn\u2019t you have the coupon.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">MOTHER: I don\u2019t have a coupon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Why didn\u2019t you get the coupon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">MOTHER: Where do you get a coupon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I know I told you about the coupon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">FATHER: You mentioned a coupon but you you said you were able to get them for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you just Google. Just Google Daytrana coupon and they float down from heaven. I just updated mine the other day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">MOTHER: I went on and there was an Rx card, but I Googled that and that looked like a scam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: If you just go to Daytrana.com, the first thing you will see is savings plan. And it\u2019s true of Vyvanse too. Has he been on Vyvanse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">MOTHER: Yes. Vyvanse we didn\u2019t have a good experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I thought that was right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">MOTHER: But I\u2019m not I\u2019m questioning whether because he\u2019s had bad experiences not on Vyvanse now, so I\u2019m just wondering whether that was the beginning of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: In terms of anger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">MOTHER: Yes, so I\u2019m kind of wondering whether I would like to try the Adderall site [ph] again, is where I\u2019d like to go this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Well definitely, then, get the coupon for Vyvanse and go down that route, would be my next suggestion for your physician. Because it generally, on average, mostly has fewer side effects. And generic Adderall seems to sometimes have a problem. People who were on brand name Adderall do not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E51\">think the generic was as effective. And there\u2019s some questions. I actually site a person at the FDA in my book as saying she\u2019s heard it too many times about generics in general to think that they\u2019re isn\u2019t some kind of problem. So they haven\u2019t been able to establish that, but nobody tests it. Who\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E52\">to pay to do controlled studies of generic medications?  Nobody I know. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">MOTHER: Well, that\u2019s really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And that makes me a little nervous about generic Adderall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">MOTHER: It\u2019s great to know. When he was on Concerta it I loved Concerta. It was wonderful, except he didn\u2019t eat. Other than that but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Okay, but if Concerta worked, here...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">MOTHER: I loved Concerta.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Come back to reality for a second. Ruth will be there in a moment. Here\u2019s the more important issue. And I love you, Kevin, you\u2019re a great guy, and Ruth thinks you\u2019re awesome and she\u2019s about to jump over the back of the chair, but you\u2019re kind of a whiner about medicine. And you\u2019re going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F11\">have to buck it up and be tolerant of some of it. Now if you\u2019re having itchy skin, okay, I realize that\u2019s the shortcoming of the ADD people. They hate those things, and I understand. So then maybe you need to go back to Concerta. If it worked well and the Daytrana worked well, except for it being sticky, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F12\">and you\u2019re then you\u2019re going to have to eat; you\u2019re going to have to will yourself to eat.  This is the only way it ever works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">KEVIN: I loved to eat when I was little and but I lost 20 pounds on that pill, and I\u2019m not going back to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: The pill did not make you lose weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">KEVIN: Well, I know, but I didn\u2019t eat because of the pill because if I ate, it would feel like I was going to throw up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: For you to be on enough medicine wait a minute, backup, what did you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">KEVIN: When I was eating, it felt like I was going to throw up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: When you were how old?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">KEVIN: This was sixth grade, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">MOTHER: You were on Concerta first, so that was fourth and fifth grade probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">KEVIN: And then at the lake you took that picture of my back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: Picture of your back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">KEVIN: Remember the back, shoulder blades sticking out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">MOTHER: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t dispute you lost weight. I am saying you didn\u2019t lose weight because you took the pill. Now that\u2019s why I made you back up and not [inaudible] because you\u2019re saying you felt nauseous on it.  And did that last for very long because that is a side effect early in the medication?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">KEVIN: It lasted until we got off of it. And I know you\u2019re probably not going to believe this, but every time...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll probably call you a whiner, won\u2019t I?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">KEVIN: Well it literally every time that I tried to eat, it felt like I was going to throw up. I mean you know that feeling when you want to eat but you can\u2019t eat because it feels like you\u2019re full and then if you eat it feels like you\u2019re going to throw up? It was that feeling times ten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Well, one thing you\u2019re kind of forgetting is how bad has that been on Daytrana?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">KEVIN: It hasn\u2019t been as bad as that. It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Okay, part of this is you\u2019re older now and you are more able to manage yourself. And Daytrana and Concerta are the same medicine. They\u2019re exactly the same medicine except one is on a sticker and one is in a little nuclear [inaudible] medicine leaks out into your stomach.  So the only possible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">and none of that throwing up business on Vyvanse or feeling like that? Did you have that feeling on Vyvanse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">MOTHER: You were...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">KEVIN: I\u2019ve had that feeling on all the pills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">MOTHER: Well Vyvanse you were only on for about a month before we we thought that was increasing his anger. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: I would like to do placebo trials on you. That\u2019s what I want to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">MOTHER: Can he live with you while he does it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: Well there\u2019s... I get your point. I would like to do placebo. And it\u2019s very easy, okay. We will actually, as long as your doctor doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, with Vyvanse it\u2019s super easy because you can it\u2019s an FDA approved it\u2019s approved by the FDA to break the capsule in water and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">drink it.  And some days you\u2019ll put it in there and some days you won\u2019t. And we\u2019ll see what days that he has stomach problems. Because I think you may be psyching yourself out about this. Well I know you don\u2019t believe it and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to do a scientific study. We\u2019re going to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">KEVIN: Every day that I\u2019m off the patch at school, I literally I go up and I get two entrees because I\u2019m so hungry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: No, no, I don\u2019t doubt the part where you\u2019re not hungry. But not the part about being nauseous. That part I am having problems with. Because it is I do know people who\u2019ve had that. But the problem is that you\u2019re not as motivated about this as I wish you were.  You can also put it in applesauce, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201271\">by the way, but you have to eat all the applesauce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">FATHER: In terms of the patch, if it didn\u2019t itch, would you take would you put the patch on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">KEVIN: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">FATHER: You don\u2019t it doesn\u2019t bother you how you feel or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">KEVIN: It just affects my eating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: But it doesn\u2019t make you that\u2019s going to happen no matter what. We all agree. No matter what, that\u2019s going to happen. But it\u2019s this nausea thing that I\u2019m trying to figure out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">KEVIN: That was more I kind of it sounds like I stretched that a little bit. What I really meant was when you\u2019re really hungry, your stomach\u2019s queasy. It\u2019s and but and you want to eat but you also don\u2019t want to eat.

And in sixth grade I had 27 sack lunches in my locker because I couldn\u2019t eat. And I was always embarrassed about that because I would never eat.

I\u2019m I could not eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Because that is unusual. It is not unusual to have no appetite and it is 95% of the time we can work around it.

Well, now, see this is all new to me. You weren\u2019t taking it off and we had a big dispute about you taking it off in October and you were taking it off. That wasn\u2019t the stated reason you were taking it off. You were taking it off because you wanted to be done with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F1\">the medicine. Secondly, you\u2019re telling me sometimes you take it off before lunch and then you\u2019re hungry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">KEVIN: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">THERAPIST: No. No. Not possible. There\u2019s [inaudible] hours\u2019 worth of medicine left in your system after you take it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">KEVIN: I know, not right before lunch.

That\u2019s literally what it felt like. And so I had to take it off. And when I took it off it also sting it also was stinging really bad.

It\u2019s a kid your age and the mom was in here. Said oh my gosh, that seems really terrible. And she says no, I can\u2019t feel it; it\u2019s no thing. And it\u2019s they have to keep moving it around. She\u2019s like a checkerboard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">KEVIN: That\u2019s what our does. That\u2019s what mine does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Okay, but that\u2019s what\u2019s so weird to me, is she doesn\u2019t feel that but it\u2019s still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">KEVIN: It\u2019s still here right now, and it\u2019s dry skin. It\u2019s probably not there still. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you\u2019re putting ointment on that for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">KEVIN: Yeah, I just started doing that yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s that subjective feeling of stinging I\u2019ve never heard before. I\u2019ve heard a lot of other things, like it leaves a rash sometimes, and she didn\u2019t even have the rash. It was just odd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">FATHER: What about the tape? Could it be the KT tape?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">FATHER: I mean maybe you\u2019re allergic to the KT tape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: The adhesive on the tape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">KEVIN: Maybe. Well it doesn\u2019t leave a red mark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">FATHER: Have we tried other types of tape that may work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">KEVIN: The first tape that you brought home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Where have you gone tapeless?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">KEVIN: I\u2019ve never done that because it usually falls off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Do you put have you tried putting alcohol not on the tender part because that would hurt, and I don\u2019t really want to hurt you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">KEVIN: I\u2019ve never tried it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: On the part wipe it down with alcohol first, let it dry, which\u2019ll happen quickly, then put the patch on because oils the only way that patch is not sticking to your skin is if your skin is oily.  And I\u2019m not being offensive by saying it probably is. You\u2019re a young man this age and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201971\">might be. Because I\u2019ve never not that\u2019s not true. The last time we had adhesive problems with Daytrana was in probably 2009 when they had recalls. They had nine recalls on Daytrana because they couldn\u2019t either couldn\u2019t stick or the adhesive was doing this to people. And we just haven\u2019t had that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201972\">problem since then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">FATHER: Now they\u2019ve got super glue in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Yeah you could do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">MOTHER: That\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: That would...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">FATHER: Try taking it off after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">KEVIN: Gorilla glue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: That wouldn\u2019t hurt at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">MOTHER: We haven\u2019t tried the alcohol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, if you you might try that. And try the experiment of leaving out the tape and because it has to stick long enough for you because you\u2019re taking it off early. And if you\u2019re hungry at lunch you shouldn\u2019t be any hungrier at lunch taking it off at PE than you would be otherwise because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A91\">there\u2019s still medicine in your system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">KEVIN: PE lunch is my fifth hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: What about what\u2019s breakfast been like?

Just cereal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">KEVIN: Usually cereal.

Just something, like some oatmeal, fruit, peanut butter and jelly sandwich. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">FATHER: Bacon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">FATHER: Bacon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Bacon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">KEVIN: I have a lot of bacon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Something at lunch that\u2019s just enough to get you through the days because breakfast and dinner are the ADD people\u2019s meals. The lunch is never going to be any good for you. So if you can weigh up the breakfast, whatever he\u2019s taking, up the breakfast. And I don\u2019t even care if you take it after <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD1\">you eat the breakfast. If you\u2019re on Vyvanse, it will kick in fast enough. So will Concerta because the outside of that capsule is coated with methylphenidate so it kicks in pretty quick. So if you can take it after you eat or as you eat, that might help with the nausea later. Just we\u2019ve got to come <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD2\">up with a better solution than this. And you are a smart guy who solves problems. You like to fix things.  You like to go out and spray paint the wheels of the tractor. You are always solving problems. This isn\u2019t that hard. There\u2019s got to be a way. And then you eat a big meal later. You\u2019re surely hungry <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD3\">by seven in the evening aren\u2019t you? Eight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">MOTHER: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">THERAPIST: if you take the patch off at noon and you\u2019re not hungry at eight, I don\u2019t believe it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">MOTHER: Well you come home and you eat all sorts of snacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">KEVIN: Well yeah, after...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">MOTHER: ...and then you\u2019re not hungry for dinner so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Oh, well that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">KEVIN: No, no. After the days that I take off my patch, then I\u2019m hungry.

He just said almost took a sentence out of the book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">KEVIN: And I don\u2019t like being serious. I like being serious but not all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">MOTHER: Now I\u2019ve known people who\u2019ve been on the medicine and they\u2019re zombie like. And I would I never wanted you to be zombie like. So I don\u2019t see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">THERAPIST: And just for the record, I\u2019m not trying to argue with you, but I\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s ever been on a medicine and been zombie like in my entire career. I\u2019ve heard this, I\u2019ve heard people say it, I\u2019ve never sat in this office and never [inaudible] And I know they must exist but that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F91\">because we don\u2019t ever let anybody be on a medicine that would leave them and say it doesn\u2019t actually make a lot of sense [inaudible] What he says about being too serious, that I\u2019ve seen.  Believe you me. The problem is, as I actually discuss this in the book, that a person has to think about being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F92\">who they are. And the problem is, see, that\u2019s why I told you the Evan story early on. Evan thinks who he is, is a person who can focus in school and read at the seventh or eighth grade level when he\u2019s in third when he was in third grade he could read at the eighth grade level. And he thinks that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F93\">who he is. And when he\u2019s off medicine he thinks that\u2019s not who he is. And the problem is you think that who you are is an off medicine person, and I would argue that\u2019s not actually who you are. You may like that because you don\u2019t have to be as serious, but the point of being in school is to be serious. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F94\">If you want to negotiate and not take as much medicine on the weekend, there\u2019s ways to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">FATHER: I think you hit it on the head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">THERAPIST: People don\u2019t usually call me.

If I see a number from the elementary school I think oh my gosh, my wife hasn\u2019t picked Evan up. She forgot him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">MOTHER: Right, right. I agree.

I think he thinks he\u2019s perceived or off medicine is who he is as opposed to I think that\u2019s right on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20221\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s the same experience you had only I think you had the super nuclear experience. I think after two or three days then you would start to question wow, who am I; I don\u2019t seem the same. And you have to always, at your tender age, you have to always ask the question: am I more impaired <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202211\">than I want to be, and therefore has medicine helped me.  At your age it you are not going to be able to be a successful student and express your intelligence, which you have plenty of, without learning to become friends with the medicine. And there are ways you can strategically do this so that when <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202212\">you don\u2019t want to be serious then you can do that. And when you need to be serious you can be. But you kind of want to not be serious more than is helpful. And you\u2019re a generation, again, man, who think not getting serious is a pretty great deal. I\u2019m watching them wash out of school and college left <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202213\">and right right now. I did a show about that last year.  So we want it is critically important. And your parents, I know they\u2019re super annoying parents, are trying really hard with you to get you where you need to be. And I appreciate that because I see a lot of parents, and you\u2019re going to punch <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202214\">me, Kevin, but Ruth will bite you if [inaudible] You are there are a lot of parents who get to this point and they say and I hear about it because the kid\u2019s in college now, and they say I remember back in eighth grade, right, and he didn\u2019t want to take it and so we decided well, we can\u2019t fight him, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202215\">what are we going to do, shove it down his throat. And so we quit giving it to him. And I\u2019m like how did that turn out? And they\u2019re like well, he only failed half his classes from that point on, and we just thought maybe the ones he succeeded in he\u2019d be okay. And then we\u2019re two years into community <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202216\">college and you have a 1.3 GPA.  And everybody looks back and they say it was that eighth grade year. Everything was going fine and we decided to give it a try and get off it. I probably have 200 stories that go that way. So even though it\u2019s annoying, we have to find a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20220-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20220-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20223\">FATHER: Well even Mom told you that the other day, about how we care and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it.

It\u2019s like y minus x equals 6. Then we have to do what is y, what is x, and how does it equal six. So we do three minus I mean nine take away three and it would be six. And so we do 9, 3, and then we find out another way to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202291\">get six. And then we graph it. But we also have to simplify it first. There\u2019s different problems. What would be 3x plus 4x equals...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022B\">FATHER: 12x, or 12. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">KEVIN: No, it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, but then you have to graph it. And I my brain exploded halfway through that because I couldn\u2019t understand anything that she was saying. And I forgot my glasses today, and each time that I don\u2019t wear my glasses I get behind. And she has her projector this close. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D1\">The screen\u2019s right where that couch is, and she has a projector this close to it so the thing\u2019s this big. And I can\u2019t see it at all. And I\u2019m the third row back which doesn\u2019t help. And yeah, so I had to go in advisory and get help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">THERAPIST: That sounds like a crappy day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">KEVIN: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">THERAPIST: The medicine was over by one and when class was morning or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">KEVIN: Actually, we took can you just tell him that later?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20234-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20234-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20237\">THERAPIST: She took your medicine for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20239\">MOTHER: Okay...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023B\">KEVIN: No. Here\u2019s another thing [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023D\">MOTHER: You\u2019re going to call the police on me. I started taking Adderall, the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023F\">THERAPIST: Whose Adderall did you start taking? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20241\">MOTHER: I talked to the doctor and he was on board. He was like we\u2019re trying this. So I just have the smallest dose and it the short duration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20243\">FATHER: This is right after the bra story, is when she...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20245\">MOTHER: I can\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20247\">KEVIN: You wanted to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20249\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that was a good one; I love that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024B\">MOTHER: Well it actually the conversation...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Are you on it today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">MOTHER: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t think so. I\u2019m going to watch and see if I can tell. Okay, you\u2019re on wait. So you\u2019re on her Adderall? You people...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">MOTHER: It\u2019s the short okay. It\u2019s the short duration, whatever. So I am thinking I\u2019d like to try Adderall again before we spend $220 on a new medication. I did. I gave him one of my Adderalls for a couple of days. Two days. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">THERAPIST: Fast acting Adderall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">MOTHER: Fast thank you. I knew there was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">KEVIN: They\u2019re so fast acting I can feel it dissolving in my mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">THERAPIST: Right, that\u2019s not fast acting but I know what you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">MOTHER: So but it\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s the 5 milligram or whatever.  And so we give him one in the morning and then when he gets home from school this was yesterday I gave him another one that would how long is that, six hours? Four hours?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they don\u2019t last very long. That\u2019s why it\u2019s fast acting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">MOTHER: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">THERAPIST: Four hours, that\u2019s why you end up taking two or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">MOTHER: I was thinking it was six.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">THERAPIST: Well, they also say Adderall XR lasts, I don\u2019t know, eight or nine hours, and I\u2019ve never known anybody well, maybe one or two people. That\u2019s what the difference with Vyvanse is, it really does last longer. Now, sometimes it lasts too long so but the thing you don\u2019t really want to do is <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202671\">to get into a lot of fast acting because you will eventually start getting this. Now testing it that way, what did you learn? How did it turn out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">MOTHER: Well, see, he\u2019s at school, so I don\u2019t know. Do you know he says he was fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">KEVIN: I was I could also I said this about the patch, too, but I could be myself and I could focus whenever I wanted to, but then it\u2019d last go away like an hour yeah, just about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s about right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">MOTHER: I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">THERAPIST: So yeah, I mean the only I will say, and I normally would never say this, but if Kevin took two short actings a day, with the prescriber\u2019s permission, and he could eat in between and he\u2019d get his second one at the nurse\u2019s office, it\u2019s been years since we\u2019ve ever tried that but it that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202711\">one idea. But it that five is not very much compared to what he was on before. And so that theoretically that might work, but I would be concerned about what his dip point would be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">MOTHER: Well, and would there be enough for homework, is my see, I was thinking he was lasting almost all day at school and then after school the other would [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">THERAPIST: If you take and this is all your doctor\u2019s got to tell you to do this, not me, but many people who take short acting take three a day; that\u2019s what they\u2019re set up to take. But the problem is, then, that this is not something the ADD people are particularly good at remembering to do. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202751\">so I have people on fast acting because there\u2019s a couple of prescribers in town that are just way too in love with it, and they give it out to college students, which I think is problematic. And the college students do because a) it does create a higher abuse potential and b) they can\u2019t remember. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202752\">put it in their phone and make they forget to have the bottle with them, like the glasses.  They don\u2019t [inaudible] so if...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20274-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20274-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20277\">FATHER: And some use it to study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20279\">THERAPIST: Well yes, and I that said, I have some college students who are so smart about how they manage their medicine that they really do control their doses appropriately, usually with Vyvanse, so that they get the maximum benefit out of it. But Kevin\u2019s several years away from reaching that level <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202791\">of wisdom in his management. These are the stars. I mean these are the people who are really good with their medicine, and they have good prescribers they work with well. I think, actually, it\u2019s more the kids work well with the prescribers. The prescribers sort of trust them and [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B\">MOTHER: Now these are under the Ritalin right? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D\">THERAPIST: No, that wait, which one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027F\">MOTHER: Well, see, maybe I\u2019m I was thinking Vyvanse and no, Vyvanse and Adderall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20281\">THERAPIST: Vyvanse is under Adderall. Adderall and Vyvanse are both amphetamine based although Vyvanse is complex. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20283\">MOTHER: Right, Concerta\u2019s Ritalin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20285\">THERAPIST: Concerta\u2019s a Ritalin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20287\">MOTHER: Okay, so Adderall and Vyvanse are similar then? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20289\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028B\">MOTHER: So but you\u2019re still seeing better results with Vyvanse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D\">THERAPIST: It does vary from person to person, but the reason not very many people are on Adderall XR anymore is because a lot of people had problems with it when it went generic, and the doctors, a lot of the doctors, are just going straight to Vyvanse. With the coupon the price is pretty good now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D1\">You guys are hitting a deductible, right? That\u2019s your you\u2019re aiming towards a deductible? Because eventually won\u2019t you get a better drug benefit than that or not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">MOTHER: I think we\u2019re...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20291\">FATHER: Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20293\">MOTHER: Well I don\u2019t know about the deductible, but I know that we end up being reimbursed for half. So for a $220 prescription every month, we get half that back. So I don\u2019t know about the deductible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20295\">FATHER: Well, I think it\u2019s like $200 on deductible for medicine. There\u2019s office visits that are different. Five office visits for $25 and then after that until you get your deductible. But medical they pay a portion every medical cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20297\">THERAPIST: And whatever you get at your doctor\u2019s office now is the same parity with us, so we haven\u2019t learned exactly how this is going to work but you should have the same cost here that you have in the doctor\u2019s office. We\u2019ll see how that all turns out. Well I mean if it\u2019s you certainly there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202971\">no reason to not try an XR, an Adderall XR. There\u2019s no reason not to try that if that\u2019s more economically beneficial. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going how much are you paying for sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20299\">MOTHER: For everything that we\u2019ve purchased now I don\u2019t with the exception of Vyvanse, because I don\u2019t remember, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what did you pay for that 5 milligram? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029D\">MOTHER: Oh, hardly anything. Yes, in fact he gave me a prescription for XR. I went in and they you said it was $200 and some dollars I do that for my son. I\u2019m not doing that for me. It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2029C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029F\">THERAPIST: The Adderall XR was $200 and some odd? That\u2019s what I thought was going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A1\">MOTHER: Yeah, and so I went back and said I\u2019m just me. I don\u2019t anyway, he they gave me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A3\">THERAPIST: Your... so your cost for Vyvanse is going to be less than generic Adderall XR I think. If you\u2019re saying the XR, the Adderall XR, was $200 and some dollars, Vyvanse with the coupon will be less expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A5\">MOTHER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A7\">THERAPIST: I think maybe dramatically less expensive. I think you can get up to $60 off of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A9\">MOTHER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AB\">THERAPIST: I have a copay on mine but so I only get $30 off, but I think that\u2019s because I don\u2019t know.  I have never tried it with this version of how drug stub [ph] is, but you want the thing you have to remember is it has to be sustainable. So whatever you can come up with. And it has to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202AB1\">and it has to be financially sustainable. I\u2019m surprised short acting was that much cheaper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AD\">MOTHER: It was I can\u2019t even remember whether it was less than $20 or less than $10. I mean it was ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AF\">KEVIN: You said it was $7.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B1\">MOTHER: $7. It was ridiculous. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B3\">THERAPIST: All right. So which experiment are we going to next? You\u2019re going to try the Vyvanse next?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B5\">FATHER: What do you think Kevin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B7\">KEVIN: I just want to go off all the medicine, but I guess whichever one you guys think is best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B9\">MOTHER: Well I think we\u2019ll maybe make another appointment with Dr. Hughes because the last couple of times I\u2019ve just called and he\u2019s done me, but maybe it would be a good idea to go in and he\u2019d probably...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202BB\">THERAPIST: I\u2019d probably go with the Vyvanse, but if your price is the same that\u2019s what I would do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202BD\">MOTHER: Okay. Yet you\u2019re seeing better luck with the Vyvanse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202BF\">THERAPIST: You can do the same placebo thing with the XR by the way. I\u2019ve just never done it. And back to you, Kevin, so is there any other reason you when you say you don\u2019t really want to be on it, do you mean I don\u2019t really want to be on insulin for my diabetes either.

He might like who he is but it\u2019s and you say act your age or be yourself but it\u2019s not even goofy, it\u2019s very...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N202E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E3\">THERAPIST: Weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E5\">MOTHER: Yeah, weird. Weird, but very much younger than the age, it seems, and then very argumentative and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E7\">THERAPIST: Well I think one of the things that I want to emphasize to you, and I understand; I hear what you said; you did clarify it for me. It is like my diabetes example, and you don\u2019t have to actually take shots to get the medicine in you, so I get the added benefit of that, but I think you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202E71\">I get that it\u2019s frustrating, but I think you\u2019re going to have to reach a peace about it, and not just like a they\u2019re making me do it peace.  You\u2019re getting old enough where you have to sort of see the value in it and yourself. And you are more able to focus on it, are you not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E9\">KEVIN: Mm-hm, I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202EB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty critical. And then if you guys want to have some discussion about I\u2019m not telling you this is a good idea, I\u2019m just asking, I\u2019m just saying, if you didn\u2019t have to take it every weekend, would that be good? You would like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202ED\">KEVIN: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202EF\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how they would feel about that because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F1\">FATHER: It\u2019s kind of what he does now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F3\">MOTHER: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F5\">THERAPIST: Is that what we\u2019re doing now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F7\">MOTHER: No. That\u2019s what he I mean the biggest fights are in the morning. I mean on the weekends. And I keep going but Dr. Thome says...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F9\">THERAPIST: I know. I\u2019m not a huge fan of this but I have had cases where, for example, this is a perfect example for you. This girl I was seeing, and she said verbatim what you said, I\u2019m just too serious on it, blah, blah, blah.  And she said and I said well give me an example, and she said well I <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202F91\">just don\u2019t feel like cheering for the team. And I said well is that really that important in life? And she said I\u2019m a cheerleader. Oh, crap. So we agreed that she would not take it on the weekend and that she did not and it the only downside to that with her is she had a couple of car accidents. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202F92\">And they weren\u2019t they were minor but it just all of us, her parents and me, we were all kind of white knuckled about it because we thought man, is this exposing her to increased risk. And driving is just around the corner with you. So in the long run it all paid off and it was okay, and she even <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202F93\">got a cheerleading scholarship down the road, but the agreement was she would take it religiously during the week and do her homework, and then she had to get all her homework done before Saturday.  She was a competitive cheer; it wasn\u2019t the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FB\">MOTHER: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FD\">THERAPIST: Later she was doing by that time she was doing competitive cheer and so then she was able to not take it on the weekends. And that was the compromise. The thing is, she was whenever she was off of it she was bubbly and funny and everything. I hear you\u2019re not as bubbly and funny off of it. And so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FF\">KEVIN: Well, around my friends I am, but just they don\u2019t think I am. My friends think I am but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20301\">THERAPIST: Well you have admitted in here previously that you can be kind of irritable in those situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20303\">KEVIN: I can be but they sometimes think I\u2019m very funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20305\">THERAPIST: Okay. I mean I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to seeing you try that, but if you\u2019re going to be super annoying on the weekend and people can\u2019t stand you when you\u2019re home, I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to work out very well. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20304-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20304-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20307\">MOTHER: So can we have your number, so on Saturdays...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20309\">THERAPIST: Or he just maybe drop him off at my house or something. Great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2030B\">FATHER: We might even slow down and let you out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2030D\">THERAPIST: You do see my point though. The other thing you could do if Hughes is okay with it, this is a little bit off label with Vyvanse, but if you\u2019re mixing it in water, you can split the dose in half. Now I absolutely do that in my universe because that helps appetite on the weekend, but it keeps <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2030D1\">people kind of together. And you just the reason that that\u2019s not FDA approved, or more correctly it\u2019s off label, is because, again, they haven\u2019t done any research to test it that way. But all you\u2019re doing is cutting the dose in half. And I there\u2019s a guy, weirdly enough, his name\u2019s Peter Winchester, <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2030D2\">like the bird, [ph] that he\u2019s a psychiatrist in Maryland that has a blog. And he\u2019s a child analyst and psychologist.  He does a lot of work with ADD, and that\u2019s one of his recommendations, is to titrate those. So you can do you can see if there\u2019s any problem doing that. The part about mixing it <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2030D3\">in water, that\u2019s on label, that\u2019s in the instructions. It says you can do that. But taking a little less, there isn\u2019t it\u2019s just taking a little less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2030F\">MOTHER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20311\">FATHER: Do you refrigerate afterwards?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20313\">THERAPIST: We don\u2019t, and it says online, on the FDA thing, that you cannot store it, but there isn\u2019t any reason not to store that. So and he says that he Winchester says he hasn\u2019t had any trouble storing it. So you could refrigerate it if you wish. But just the main thing is you\u2019ve got to shake <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203131\">it. It\u2019s got to be mixed up good. And I don\u2019t know that it ever fully dissolves. It may go into a suspension because it looks kind of cloudy in there, but if you shake it up good that will let you get a lower dose for the weekend, and that might be a good compromise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20315\">MOTHER: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20317\">FATHER: Because I try to convey if you are off it on it five days and off two, that\u2019s not really keeping it in the system. I think that\u2019s where you get the peaks and valleys as well, especially on the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20319\">THERAPIST: You come down harder. That\u2019s true of medicines like antidepressants and such. The this medicine is gone from your system when it\u2019s gone. But it does build tolerance, and this is allegedly controversial. I know I\u2019ve talked to you guys about this before. It\u2019s not controversial for anybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203191\">who\u2019s been on ADD medicine for very long. Everybody who\u2019s on them knows about tolerance. So he\u2019s going to, in the week, build his brain\u2019s going to expect the medicine to be there, and so he\u2019s prone to more withdrawal on the weekends, which is why I think lowering doses is always better than being <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203192\">off of it completely.  And I say this about the cheerleader; I almost think maybe that\u2019s what we did on the weekends, was drop her. I can\u2019t remember. But we\u2019ve done that in other situations. These medicines are not it is not a very straightforward path from here to there. It you are experiencing <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203193\">the complexities. I have a kid I see, we only just recently got her meds right after about two years. I hate to say that, but she needed them bad and had headaches with the different medicines, and she had a breathing issue with Vyvanse. And she was very motivated to make them work because her grades <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203194\">went from 2.0 to 3.7 on medicine.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N20318-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20318-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561937\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2031B\">MOTHER: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2031D\">THERAPIST: Really was benefiting from it. She, too, couldn\u2019t finish sentences without it. And so she was motivated, but we finally got to Concerta and that did it.  Or she got the patch. One of the two. I think maybe the patch. And that was finally it after a long period of experimentation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2031F\">MOTHER: I loved Concerta. We actually ended up trying Intuniv as well, at the same time. But then he was I mean talk about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20321\">THERAPIST: Right, that speaking of zombies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20323\">MOTHER: That was awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20325\">THERAPIST: And actually that\u2019s because it\u2019s not a stimulant. And there are when I said I\u2019ve never seen [inaudible] here on medicine, I\u2019ve never seen anyone on a stimulant that\u2019s been in that situation. Intuniv is a blood pressure medicine. It\u2019s a time release version of Tenex. And it\u2019s similar but <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203251\">not the same as Clonidine. And that is going to subdue your hyperactivity and lower your mood. And actually Winchester, in his book, says the main value in Intuniv is to control some of the irritability in the ADD people.  Well I don\u2019t that\u2019s not really that great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20327\">FATHER: It just doesn\u2019t give him the energy to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20329\">MOTHER: I didn\u2019t like I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2032B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2032D\">MOTHER: I didn\u2019t like him on it, and I mean I\u2019m the one going calm down, calm down. But I didn\u2019t like that. That was bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2032F\">FATHER: Clonidine, is that a blood thinner?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20331\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a blood pressure medicine. I take it for PRN when my blood pressure goes up, when I\u2019m going on TV or radio, that\u2019s why I sound so calm because it lowers your heart rate. Even though I\u2019m used to doing that, it always raises heart rate and then your voice sounds a little shaky and [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203311\">that happening though. And I have PRNs and that. But yeah, so that\u2019s you hit the Intuniv problem. That\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t taken off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20333\">MOTHER: I just kind of thought that they would balance each other out and then he\u2019d be but they did not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20335\">THERAPIST: I have been down the path that you are on, exactly the same path, and we could also also used to try Strattera in tandem and alone, and the best that it could ever do for us was kind of get us through the summer.  And then I began to realize [inaudible] really helped with that. So you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203351\">in a good experimental phase. You just Kevin, our only goal in life is to help you be a functional adult and to live out the things you want to do.

So eat heartily in the morning and in the evening, even if you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203352\">got to eat later in the evening, the nutrition is [inaudible] recommend. And just get whatever you can into yourself at lunch. I would even offer you should eat Poptarts at lunch, as much as I hate them. Whatever it takes.
