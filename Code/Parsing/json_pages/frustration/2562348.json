Not wrong per say, I suppose, although I\u2019m not certain about it. But, you know, I was curious to know what \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">What I recalled having apparently jogged, in my interpretation having jogged your train of thought there was something I said about feeling protective of you. Or at least that was how it seemed to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:01:31). (pause) Let\u2019s see, I mean I can imagine my thing was clear in sort of a general way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Well the meaning is clear, but how it related to our conversation was [overlapping conversation at 0:01:50].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Right. Though the thing that I remember, well first your thought that you would need to leave here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Right. Which is a very familiar pattern for me; it\u2019s not a very new development, or it\u2019s not specific or personal in that sense; in a sense that it\u2019s happened many other times. Now I suppose, you know, one could look for parallels and find envy in all of these settings. I suppose that\u2019s possible, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">but I was curious [overlapping conversation at 0:02:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I could not have the idea that (pause) that you had thought about that was unique to this situation. In other words, I didn\u2019t see that as sort of novel [for your own needs] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. I mean the impulse is very familiar, and it\u2019s been kind of the center of whatever this complex that we\u2019re mattering over is; it\u2019s clearly an important impulse that has been more or less overwhelming in the past. But how that relates generically, or even in this particular <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">case, to this specific, I don\u2019t know, relational pattern I guess you could call it, is \u2013 I found myself puzzling over it. [0:03:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">You know, at first I thought to myself, \u201cWell, you know, I mean, what the hell, right?\u201d And the more that I thought about it, the more resistant; (pause) skeptical, I don\u2019t know. Let me put it this way, I [overlapping conversation at 0:04:01] can finish explaining. Yeah, yeah. No please.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: But if that was, (sigh) what I mean, if that was that in order to actually do the work you need to do, you need to leave. That was your fantasy, which you weren\u2019t saying it necessarily true, but that you had this idea in mind. And in order to actually get started, you knew you would need <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">to leave for mysterious reasons; not a familiar one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Well no, I don\u2019t think it was mysterious. I mean I think that the rationalization, you know, in other words, the pattern is so clear that one should be skeptical of the rationalization. The rationalization was something along the lines that, you know, we had really kind of clar \u2013 and I said <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">this, I think explicitly last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">We had done I think a fairly good job at clarifying exactly what is going on here, and something about that mode of interaction; something about the way that we talk about things is preventing me from the fantasy, is preventing me from actually implementing what we had talked about and what we had <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">better I specifically, had better understood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">So that if I gave myself the opportunity to, you know, just chatter about it (inaudible at 0:05:27), whichever comes first, then I might well do so. I might well take that opportunity, and I might orient myself in my life outside, in such a way to facilitate that. So, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562348\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I mean I guess I would say that just from a like a (louder) (ph) point of view, that\u2019s really a very partial explanation, in that it [needs to \u2013 why I] (ph) like a big question around, why -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Why I would have to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Why or really what it is about the way we\u2019re talking about this. I mean, because, you know, we could talk about lots of things that it\u2019s kind of around. Not only it would necessarily prevent you from -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: (laughter) (Nausea) (ph). Adding it to an item would be a bad thing.

(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I mean, well taken. [overlapping conversation at 0:06:32] So, what you said a moment ago was that, that statement was not really motivated. But in fact, you know, regardless of what you think of the logic, and I expressly presented this as a fantasy; it wasn\u2019t like I was saying, \u201cWell, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">you know, this is an ironclad argument here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">So, I mean to the extent that it\u2019s rationed, or to the extent that it\u2019s patterned, it\u2019s obviously not rational. In other words, to the extent that this is an impulse that I\u2019ve had on a number of other occasions, there\u2019s something well beyond, or beneath, or you know, exceeding rationality at work here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">To the extent that I rationalized though, explicitly in presenting it, it wasn\u2019t like unexplained. Do you know what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">In other words, so there are a couple of levels going here, and I don\u2019t see why we need envy as an explanation. And it\u2019s not like, if the shoe fits. I feel like I\u2019m the kind of person who would be willing to wear it, and I mean I think it might be worth talking about envy in other contexts. [0:07:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">But I was surprised to think about an envious relationship between the two of us, because as I said also last week, you know, I really \u2013 what I\u2019m aware of, is just identifying with your sense of vocation. In other words, I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not at all aware in this particular interaction relationship of feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">as if, you know, you\u2019ve got something that I feel resentful of, as well as feeling like I\u2019m reaching toward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">I feel \u2013 I mean, how do you distinguish between an envious relationship in a more, I don\u2019t know, healthy sense of (pause) What\u2019s the nonpathological version of envy? If you have, you know, a friend, or you have an acquaintance, or you have a colleague, and you say to yourself, \u201cWell, that person does <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">x very well.\u201d Or, \u201cThat person has a nice car.\u201d It\u2019s not like, [overlapping conversation at 0:09:03] If you don\u2019t necessarily need to \u2013 yeah, I mean you don\u2019t necessarily need to have that car. You don\u2019t need to say, \u201cGod dammit, that mother fucker, you know, they\u2019ve got this, and I want that car.

I mean, you know, when it\u2019s like the end of the hour, or 45 minutes, or however we\u2019re defining it for official purposes. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">time to go, at 4:30 today, it\u2019s time to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562348\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">We have, as that time approaches, we\u2019re in the middle of a conversation, which doesn\u2019t necessarily conform precisely to the clock time. And we have to make a kind of a evaluation that\u2019s often very unspoken; it involves a sort of implicit relational exchange between us, you know, about when, for our <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">purposes, 4:30 is going to be; when it\u2019s time to go. [0:10:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">And I don\u2019t know, I think that there\u2019s also another version of that, which is kind of long, or our therapeutic interaction is going to extend itself, and it doesn\u2019t seem to me quite so, I don\u2019t know, kind of fucked up to \u2013 and this is a relation that I find very troubling, I guess. Maybe you didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">mean it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, here\u2019s (pause) that you find very troubling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: It seems to me that there is something sort of dark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well, and I don\u2019t mean just envy, but I mean apart from the issue of envy, with what\u2019s going on here, in that like (pause) there\u2019s some very important way in which what you came here to work on and fix isn\u2019t fixed. [0:11:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. And I\u2019ve said that, it\u2019s very, I don\u2019t know, anything to say about yourself, and I said that poignantly; I said that with a lot of emotion attached to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I know, I\u2019m not \u2013 I know, but the (pause) this idea that, well let\u2019s not analyze the things about where you need \u2013 about feeling like you need to go, because this process is getting in the way of your -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: When did we say that we weren\u2019t going to analyze it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Well, if you leave, because leaving is the only way to actually get to work, then that means that we\u2019re not going to analyze why you would feel the need leave here and stop doing this, to be able to start working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">So it seems to me [0:12:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Look, I mean, (sigh) there are many things in life that can\u2019t do until you do it on your own. And, you know, there -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: But I don\u2019t see any reason why this would need to be one of them whatsoever. And in fact the idea that it would be, seems that it must be related, especially given that this isn\u2019t like some incidental thing, this is the very thing you came for help with; came for help for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Agreed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So like, the idea that then that would just turn out to be something that actually really at the end of the day, you need to do on your own,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: So my fantasy is fantastical?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Not just fantastical, but surely indignative of something important that it must be hard to look at, or we\u2019d know it already.

That\u2019s, if anything, it\u2019s a phenomenon that we\u2019ve come upon many many times, which is that, you know, I want to do it myself. That\u2019s a very different thing.

And while our interaction in this conceptual <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">space is fruitful, and has insight attached to it, and has rapport between us, and the development of this relationship has felt productive, and good, at some point, I need to implement.

I was just so disgusted, and angry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">and resentful and jealous, I guess, at some level. I\u2019m not quite sure; I\u2019d prefer to think of it as a purer emotion than that. But, you know, I mean that\u2019s probably some of that there.

Well, and I don\u2019t know why that felt so important to me, you know, that I actually chewed on it quite a lot, even more so than usual, over our layoffs. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Well I had that thought; one possibility seems to me it\u2019s like, what you\u2019re talking about seems to involve a much more positive feeling about this, or about me, like we are doing this together. And even if you feel like that means you can\u2019t do it entirely on your own, that there\u2019s some way <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">that we\u2019re more together in it.

There\u2019s a kind of moral implication of envy, which is also unappealing. But maybe, let\u2019s dispense of the word for the moment, and get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">to the specific observation that you were making, which was that, you know, it\u2019s very painful for me to be without a vocation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">I mean I guess if that was the point of departure at any rate, you know, it was just this confusion, and pain, and really I don\u2019t know, a kind of rootlessness, that I don\u2019t quite understand.

But this is something that like, you know, expectably, you should be able to do it; you want to apply for jobs, you\u2019ll be able to apply for jobs. Or you want to sort of develop a vocation; <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">you should be able to do that.

And on the one hand, I was like, come on. On the other hand, she was totally right. And I did feel kind of powerless to conceive of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">the things that I needed to do; to perceive of them, there\u2019s question about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">And this is a funny metaphor these days, from the perspective of your preferred therapeutic approach.

At some point after that, once I\u2019m a little more settled in, presumably before future <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">rounds, we\u2019ll stop, and then I\u2019ll do the rest them myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">Like maybe this time, it\u2019s important (sigh) to do them yourself.

(pause) (sigh) I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know man; like I feel (pause) I feel, I feel kind of broken when I, you know, as in a mechanism that\u2019s broken, when I think of this strange lack of facility at (pause) me myself. And it is hard for me to imagine how through <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">an interaction, that kind of dialogical interaction like this, you know; I can undertake the actual process of rooting myself. [0:28:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">Like you know, intellectually, I know how I can be; it\u2019s not that complex, it\u2019s not again, as you said a moment ago, there\u2019s no reason I would have to stop coming here in principle for, you know, two days every week, while I was in the process of rooting myself in from the most superficial way to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">most profound way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">In practice, it\u2019s not an obstacle, but in principle somehow, somehow it feels inimical to it. And in some sense, I think, every vocational setting that I\u2019ve ever been in, or potentially vocational setting that I\u2019ve ever been in, has also felt inimical. [0:29:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: To actually getting work done at some point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah.

[0:30:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">But it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t know why. I guess there\u2019re two levels of causation here. Number one is why do I have this complex, and, you know, there\u2019re probably some reasonable answers for hypotheses that we can come to. Why I\u2019m not sitting down to do the job applications, I really don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562348\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">And I think that\u2019s what you were trying to answer last week, and I\u2019m not sure that the notion of needing to do it myself, or having an impulse that is necessary to do it myself, and it can\u2019t be done except, you know, unilaterally, to use the terminology I was a moment ago, I\u2019m not sure why they would <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">interfere with my process of doing it right now. [0:31:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">So maybe we\u2019re talking, I mean in other words, I guess, I guess what I\u2019m wondering is whether we\u2019re still talking at the wrong level. There\u2019s still something very mysterious going on, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be explained even by a further the clarification and elaboration of the thought that you were <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">having; it\u2019s not explanatory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Which thought?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: This question of why I had the fantasy. In other words, the fantasy of, you know, needing to leave is, in keeping with the kind of familiar dynamic, and one that kind of ontological sense, has been very troublesome. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be exactly what is impeding my ability to just work on <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">a very moment to moment (inaudible at 0:32:25) level. (pause) [0:33:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Is it possible you worry that somehow you\u2019d be doing the applications for me instead of for yourself? Unless I was kind of out of the picture? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: (sigh) Possibly. I mean again, that doesn\u2019t make sense, but possibly. There\u2019s no reason I couldn\u2019t do it for both. You know, both to give you a sense of satisfaction in your vocation, and (laughter) [0:34:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Right. To move forward with your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: You know that would be a good solution; it\u2019s like everybody wins, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Why shouldn\u2019t everybody win? It\u2019s not, you know, so the implication of what you\u2019re saying, I guess, is that in some intuitive space, there\u2019s a zero sumness that is kind of assumed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: But another possibility, which may or may not relate, is you might also feel you\u2019re being deceived a little bit about how much it\u2019s for you. I\u2019m just thinking about stuff that\u2019s happened at work, where like you kind of think you\u2019re in something together with somebody, and then it\u2019s kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">(bent) (ph) that you and them and everybody\u2019s going to win. And it turns out, you don\u2019t. [0:35:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I was deceived, but I was disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Okay. Sure, I don\u2019t (pause) yeah, I mean you didn\u2019t feel that there\u2019s somebody actively trying to trick you. It\u2019s more like, yeah you were disappointed when they really let you down. I think there is often a sense of like having been in something together with people, and then finding out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">that like they more self-interested than you thought, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: I mean what I would \u2013 the way that I would \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t know why precision is so important to me in this particular instance or connection. But I would say that I have been very aware of suspending my skepticism about peoples\u2019 intentions, and I think in part, because of a sense that it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">a little bit pathological, this skepticism, even paranoid. You know just kind, just through a sheer act of will, keeping it at bay, and then discovering that just because you\u2019re paranoid, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you.

And I feel, I feel much under slept, than I do sometimes when not asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">And I had this four-hour episode after Jennie parents came over; it was very unproductive, and just kind of a waste of time, basically, as she rightly pointed out. Although, on the other hand, I felt kind of intruded upon, and that made me \u2013 you know, to be intruded upon in a state of some disarray, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">is much more disarranging, or deranging, as I think we called it in the past, than just being intruded upon in general. [0:42:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">So, when I showed up here, I was a little deranged. But something about the way that we were interacting has compounded that, and I\u2019m not sure what it might be. One possibility I supposed is that this zero sumness to the process of, you know, kind of with doing the analysis, is alienating.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562348\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">In other words, I feel discomforted by your taking \u2013 your assumption as the burden of summation or of stocktaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">CLIENT: Maybe I feel \u2013 yeah I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know.

And it\u2019s weighing on me, and it has been weighing on me for some weeks now.
