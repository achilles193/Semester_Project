It will be three weeks from now I\u2019ll take a week off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re graduating soon. Is it around then that you\u2019re graduating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Actually it\u2019s on the 18th, the Saturday, so I was actually wondering maybe for those two weeks if we could find another time, since you\u2019ll be away the next week. That Monday my in-laws are leaving in the morning, which I don\u2019t know if that means I should be around or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So we should take off the 20th?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes, the 20th and then, I guess, the 27th, if there are other times those weeks. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: If you want to take a look next week as it gets closer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: The reason it\u2019s tricky for me is that that week I\u2019m out Friday, so at the moment I\u2019m pretty booked solid for the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I could probably be okay. I should probably talk to them and make sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Going two-and-a-half weeks \u2013 it could be okay for the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes, I can try. I should probably just clarify with them what they\u2019re doing anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: If it makes any difference, I might have a time open a little bit later in the day. I don\u2019t know if that helps at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: No, it probably would because they said they were going to leave in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m almost definitely going to have a 1:20 time. Would that be better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: That would probably. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay. So I\u2019m going to put you down with a question mark for then. Do you want to check on it and let me know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Where are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I guess a little better. I\u2019m done pretty much; I just have to finish up some research hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Thanks. And do my loan exit counseling, so that\u2019s not too huge of a deal. The final that I was worked up about, I already got my grade and I got a 97, so that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Wow!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: That was my main class, so that was good. I had a job interview at the [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:36) on Friday, so that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh, my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: And then I had sort of another pseudo-interview during the week. I say \u201cpseudo\u201d because she just has to wait for her new job to be secure before her position officially opens, but they already asked for my resume and gave it to her boss, so that\u2019s hopeful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Where is that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: That\u2019s at Walter Reed at the clinic. That one I\u2019m more interested in. So, yeah, it\u2019s going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: And these are for research assistant-ship kinds of positions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Sort of. The one at the [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:12) was a data coordinator, which it turns out is kind of a glorified data entry person and you don\u2019t need a Masters or anything for it. The other one is actually a patient navigator, which I don\u2019t know if you know, is kind of a new thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: For the HIV. Everyone at the Walter Reed gets screened for HIV and then they would get screened additionally if they\u2019re positive for the study and they pretty much have to have almost full-blown AIDS or actually have full-blown AIDS and be IV drug users \u2013 so pretty serious cases. Then it\u2019s an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">NIH trial that\u2019s being done in ten major cities and there are three arms of the RCT, and one of them is patient navigations.  You basically go with them to their doctor\u2019s appointments. You learn about their medications and their side effects. You go tour their methadone clinic with them. You\u2019re in contact <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F2\">a lot with them and it\u2019s to really be a support system and encourage them to adhere. That\u2019s one of the arms of the trial, so it sounds interesting. She also evaluates the program. So it\u2019s less epi and more infectious disease. It was interesting and good. I just have to wait and hear what happens from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100068\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s nice to feel that there are irons in the fire and possibilities of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was encouraging to have interviews before I\u2019m even done, so that was helpful. I haven\u2019t even applied to that many yet, so it feels a little hopeful. So that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: How have things been with your sense of yourself? You finished this exam. This is a big deal, this transition, but I wonder kind of where . . ? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s funny. My mom called the other day and asked, \u201cI just wanted to know how your interview and your exam went.\u201d And I told her and she\u2019s like, \u201cAnd how are you feeling about yourself?\u201d (laughs) \u201cAre you feeling any better about yourself?\u201d I guess the answer is not really, which is weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">because you would think. But not too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not that weird. That\u2019s why I ask because these other things can kind of cover up and, for the time being, make it feel like the external is going a little bit better; but the long-term, deeper work is still about your feelings about your own person, regardless. The reason is why it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">not surprising, Ramona, is that you\u2019ve gotten plenty of A\u2019s in the past, for example, and it doesn\u2019t touch this feeling. It\u2019s not like \u201cOh, now I\u2019m a worthwhile person\u201d and that gets inside now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">[ ] (crosstalk at 00:05:51)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: It feels like an expectation. In fact, I felt a little . . . It\u2019s silly because I\u2019m old enough. But I told my mom that I was good and I got a 97 and she was like, \u201cOf course you did. Of course they let you interview. Of course it went well.\u201d  I know how she meant it. She meant it like \u201cI had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">no doubt. I have confidence in you,\u201d but it felt a little bit like \u2013 it\u2019s baseline. (chuckles) So it\u2019s okay. I had a really long week, just really, really long days. I was exhausted, but then somehow Saturday morning by 9:00 I\u2019m redoing one of the kitchen cabinets and I thought, \u201cOkay, at least I held <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">off.\u201d I let it go during the week, but the kitchen counter was gross and I couldn\u2019t let it go anymore; so I did that. I did one cabinet and the rest of the apartment still needed to be cleaned. I let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Meaning you stopped at one cabinet; you got one cabinet cleaned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: It was already clean, I just decided I wanted to rearrange it a little bit, dishes and stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">BREAK IN TAPE FROM [00:07:05 to 00:08:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: It could also be that you\u2019re a human being who gets tired and needs a break and some time to sleep more and some time to not do as many activities. If it stays like that, that\u2019s a different story; but I also never hear that you get to say to yourself \u201cI get a break today.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100068\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Saturday and Sunday I didn\u2019t apply to any jobs. I kept up with [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:01), but it was okay. I\u2019m not going to apply to any jobs. It\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t do my loan exit counseling either, which I can do online, which I just want to make myself do today. So it\u2019s good; but I also recognized <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">the part we were talking about, like it\u2019s never enough. I guess I\u2019m still waiting to really feel good and now it\u2019s okay. I can get the apartment floor room cleaned, especially because everybody is coming to visit and if I get a solid job offer that I want, that I accept and that I have a start date <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">and I finish up these last couple of things that I have for school, then it\u2019s good. It\u2019s like that\u2019s the new . . . I\u2019m like once that happens, there\u2019s going to be something else. So on the one hand, it\u2019s probably normal to feel relief once you get a job lined up; but on the other hand, it\u2019s like there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200673\">no moment where I\u2019m stopping and feeling just good about \u201cit\u2019s done; it\u2019s over.\u201d  It\u2019s probably also because I\u2019m terrified that school is over and it does not feel good at all to have it be over because it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s been the one thing throughout everything in my life that has been steady <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200674\">and a place where, even if it\u2019s baseline or it meets everybody\u2019s expectations only, it still feels good and other people recognize it. Just being in school with all the worked-in deadlines and activities, it\u2019s such a productive atmosphere. I guess I always based my worth or self-esteem off of doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200675\">all of that and if I\u2019m left to my own devices, what\u2019s going to happen? And if I don\u2019t have those grades, whatever they are, or if I can\u2019t obsess over those things to make me feel good or alleviate my anxiety, what am I going to do?  I\u2019ve already gone down the thought process of \u201cwhat if I get fired <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200676\">from whatever job I get?\u201d which is so bizarre; but it\u2019s so typical for me to have a worst-case scenario survival plan in place. I know that\u2019s really unhealthy. I\u2019m not proud of it. So that\u2019s scary for me. On top of which I\u2019m pretty scared that once it\u2019s over and I start working, I\u2019m really worried that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200677\">a lot of resentment is either going to be solidified or it\u2019s going to really come out \u2013 especially with Ivan because it\u2019s going to be the end of the two-year agreement and he\u2019s still going to be not quite holding up his end \u2013 still really struggling to say supportive things about what I\u2019ve done \u2013 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200678\">it\u2019s going to be over. There\u2019s going to be no room to correct it, fix it, deal with it, and I worry about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201cthe end of the two-year agreement\u201d what\u2019s the two-year agreement?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: We just agreed that I was going to go to school for two years and we agreed that Ivan was going to work full time for two years. That was pretty much it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And after that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: There wasn\u2019t really, although it was kind of implied. Before the whole grad school thing happened it was implied that Ivan was going to be working for those two years and he was hopefully going to be getting started on his PhD or getting into better jobs \u2013 and I would probably just work for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">a while. I really worry about that and it sounds like I can\u2019t get over it. I mean I can\u2019t, evidently, and I don\u2019t want to be like that. I don\u2019t want to carry around this grudge, but I\u2019m worried that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen and I\u2019m also worried that in whatever happens with him, I\u2019m not going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">have this school thing that\u2019s kept me afloat to hang onto. And what if I\u2019m not good at my job? And what if it doesn\u2019t pan out? And what if my coworkers don\u2019t like me? And what if there is no baseline measure of success? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100068\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: What if you struggle the way Ivan has?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I feel all of this pressure to either get the perfect job that pays a lot of money or what if I don\u2019t have anything for a while and then I could be applying or not applying like he has been and just in this limbo. It feels right now like no matter what I do, I\u2019m really scared that it\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">to bring that issue with us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: It feels like those things and how you feel about yourself in this stage of your life and how you feel about him in this instance are so intertwined. It\u2019s like you are simultaneously imagining \u201cthis is going to make me feel this much more critical of myself as well as of him.\u201d I was thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">the same thing about your quitting school. Even though you talk about your childhood a lot of times, it sounds like school \u2013 and I may be projecting a little bit because you haven\u2019t said it in this level of detail \u2013 but I imagine you going to school, getting homework assignments, coming home, doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">your homework. This has been kind of structuring and the scaffolding, in a way, that\u2019s given you a sense of yourself. It feels like something that you can hang your hat on that makes you feel good enough about yourself is getting good grades, meeting deadlines, getting on top of things.  To be at this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200753\">turning point where you\u2019re imagining letting go of that as the scaffolding of your positive sense of yourself is terrifying. Who are you going to think of yourself? How are you going to think of yourself as an employee, at a job, where it\u2019s not . . . There aren\u2019t grades. Certainly, there will be evaluations <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200754\">of some kind. At every job there are, but it\u2019s really, really, really quite different. You felt good about yourself or about checking off the boxes of school. In some ways, to me, this is an opportunity to get to know more about what those feelings are underlying because they\u2019ll come out a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200755\">more without this scaffolding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m really worried. It also feels like the one place I\u2019ve always been where I get recognized for doing well in varying levels, but also all of the adults are responsible and they\u2019re there and they\u2019re reliable.  It\u2019s an environment where I can count on other people where it\u2019s a very strict <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">expectation. If this professor didn\u2019t get back to you, that just isn\u2019t allowed to happen. They have their people to answer to. There are all these other people who are doing the same thing. I guess it feels supportive, it feels safe, it feels secure. How can going to school be a bad thing? You\u2019re doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200772\">something really good and productive that\u2019s contributing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a really interesting association, too, because in a way you\u2019re saying that school is an environment where you have mostly gotten to count on the authority figures doing what they\u2019re supposed to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100068\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: They might be better or worse at their job a little bit, but they\u2019re still going to show up. They have to teach the class. They have to grade your papers. They have to get their grades in or else they get in trouble, right? There\u2019s another authority holding them accountable and that\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">so reassuring to have adults in your life who do their job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: I feel like it\u2019s a place where people who have potential have to use it. At some level, they all have to. I guess I feel like my parents and Ivan \u2013 there is so much potential and they don\u2019t have to fulfill it. I\u2019m also a little scared that it\u2019s going to be hard because it\u2019s the one area in which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">my dad can talk. He can talk about school, he can talk about work, and that\u2019s like it. And he\u2019s already . . . He wants me to go to vet school, pretty much. I was pre-vet undergrad. That was my focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: He says that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: He would never say that, but he\u2019s still like, \u201cWhat about those jobs with . . . I know a couple of the people at school who are vets. What about contacting them?\u201d It\u2019s not something that I\u2019m opposed to, but I just feel that he still really wants that for me.  I guess it\u2019s a little scary to let <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">go of that, too, because it\u2019s the one area in which he always looks favorably upon me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a way you feel like you have contact and connectedness with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Right. And I\u2019ll have that if I get a good job. I will have that. But I already feel pressure because he\u2019s like, \u201cNow, don\u2019t take the first offer you get, Ramona. If someone does give you an offer, you don\u2019t have to rush.\u201d I feel all this pressure. I know he probably doesn\u2019t mean to put it that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">way. Between that and my mother-in-law continually harping on the CDC, I\u2019m just like I really just want to get something; and whatever I get I want people to not make a fuss, but I want them to have something positive to say instead of \u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, but you could have done . . .\u201d especially in light <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">of what\u2019s been going on with Ivan.  If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for his parents to say he\u2019s managing a coffee shop and that\u2019s just the way it is; but \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you working for one of the biggest [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:12) organizations?\u201d It feels like all or nothing. It feels<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">BREAK IN TAPE FROM [00:19:16 to 00:20:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m not going to let that work me up. It\u2019s my job and I\u2019m going to do what I want or what I\u2019m capable of doing. That would be the healthy way to go about it. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: So who \u2013 this is your father, maybe, inside you? What could this possibly feel like with her? Did he have expectations? How did that play out as a kid \u2013 expectations around job and school? Was there pressure from your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s the thing, my parents would never in my entire life ask me or, to my knowledge, call me to work on homework or study for an exam. To have done that would have been an insult. In fact, sometimes my dad, even just in grad school, would be like, \u201cWell I know you\u2019ve got to study.\u201d That <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">type of thing, which is kind of insulting because coming from them, they would just never have asked us to do our assignments or anything like that because (laughs) we were never not going to do them. It\u2019s just the way things were.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100068\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Both you and your sister?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: You automatically did your work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: They could just take that as a given?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t feel like there was ever a situation \u2013 no. And they never said like \u201cwe need you to get all A\u2019s\u201d or \u201cwe would love you more if you got all A\u2019s,\u201d but it was also never a big deal.  Sometimes we\u2019d go to dinner at the end of a school year or something or once we did get our report <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">cards, but it\u2019s not like a \u201clet\u2019s go celebrate.\u201d They never did that, but my dad did have a tough time the first time I got a D in chemistry. (laughs) He did have a tough time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: It was just a marking period grade. It wasn\u2019t my total grade, but I had done very poorly on the exam and it wasn\u2019t because I hadn\u2019t studied. I\u2019m still bad at chemistry, kind of, but he was just speechless. He just didn\u2019t say anything and then there was a parent\/teacher conference that came up <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">and he went in and spoke to my chemistry teacher alone and wanted to know what I should be doing. (sighs) And then he spent some time with me preparing for the next exam and telling me \u201cokay, these are the sample book questions that your professor thinks the exam is really based on the book, so you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F2\">need to be doing these instead.\u201d  I know he meant well, but it felt a little difficult because I wasn\u2019t slacking off. That would have been one thing, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: There is no emphasis on applauding your effort and you\u2019re working really hard at something as a kind of paramount thing and the grade is really secondary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I think my dad would never think of it that way because he works insanely hard. His dad worked insanely hard. No one would ever \u2013 it would be like an insult if someone asked him to go to work or asked him to apply to a job because it\u2019s just understood, expected, baseline. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s kind of how you feel when Ivan\u2019s parents are saying things like that to you, like \u201cdo they know who I am? Don\u2019t they know I\u2019m going to get a job and I\u2019m going to do well?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: But I guess that\u2019s the thing you\u2019re describing. It\u2019s so assumed. I don\u2019t know how to describe this. It\u2019s almost like you don\u2019t get to get applause if you do well at something. It\u2019s just taken as a given expectation \u2013 your mom saying, \u201cWell, of course.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I had a situation in which I got really upset about it, which is really weird for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: When you were younger you\u2019re saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: No. Within the last couple of years. My friend, Judy, from college, a really great friend, I really love her. She\u2019s wonderful, but we\u2019re different in a lot of ways. She did this internship down at Disney. She likes to cook and she did this cooking program for one year during college.  She came <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">back from the internship and she moved in with her parents and she didn\u2019t have a job until May and she came back around Thanksgiving; and they were totally fine with this because she was like, \u201cIf I take a bad job, I know myself and I won\u2019t apply to more.\u201d So they just let her not do any \u2013 and my parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF2\">would never let me.
