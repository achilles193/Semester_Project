(Pause) [I'm tired of talking about me] (ph). (Pause) I had an okay day at school yesterday. I'm doing an independent study with a historian (inaudible at 0:02:57). [0:02:58] So for my project I'm going to [be doing] (ph) books with her, and she's helping <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">me do research. So that's very (inaudible at 0:03:10). There's so much that's not been written about, and I was just wondering if maybe after I've (inaudible at 0:03:22) maybe I could study history (chuckling), go back to graduate school, but this time for a degree that I don't have (chuckling), a subject <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">I have not studied. (Sniffing) (Pause) Let's see. [0:04:00] Yeah, she... I have to write a response for every book that we read. And yesterday she was saying, you should get some of these published (chuckling), as book reviews. And I liked that she had thought they were decent enough to get published <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">(ph) (chuckling). (Pause) (inaudible at 0:04:30).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">I don't like the workshop at all. All these anxieties of people not liking me are just there all the time for three hours. And that's very daunting to be at the edge of your seat for three hours (chuckling). [0:04:59] Facing all of that [wasn't a good thought] (ph). (Sighing) (Pause) I just keep thinking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">these people don't like me. And I tell myself, that's okay of they don't. I have my own group now. I mean, not as (inaudible at 0:05:41) at least some people that I see on a weekly basis. (Pause) [0:06:00] There's a conference that the department is also taking part in. It's like a national level conference, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">and the professors here, they've put me on a panel with this visiting writer (sneezing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Thank you. I was telling my colleagues about that yesterday, and all of them were like (ph) as if I was telling them about something so uninteresting and boring or mundane. They just looked so blank (sniffing). They're blank all the time (chuckling). That's what... it's just like... and I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">feeling so disappointed, like (inaudible at 0:06:49) even though this is your department and your (inaudible at 0:06:53). We're talking about work or some aspect of it. They have absolutely no interest in anything (laughing). [0:07:04] I mean, they seem to me like undergraduates who are not... seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">interested in anything (blowing nose). (Pause) (Sniffing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Yeah, I guess I want to find a place where I can be useful and where I shine, and people aren't all weirded out by that or... there's no... or there's not too much politics. It seems like I still haven't found that kind of... [0:07:59] (Pause) I don't know. I don't know what happens. I don't trust people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">or I hold them up to a high standard, and they fail or judge myself too much [because I don't] (ph)... but finding the sort of people you can... yeah, you like for a long period of time, it just doesn't happen with me (chuckling). I don't know why. (Pause) [0:09:00] [0:10:00] (Sniffing, clearing throat, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">sighing, sniffing) [0:11:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559488\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Nothing much (laughing). (Pause) Yeah, I just... (Pause) I don't know. I don't know what to focus on (chuckling). (Pause) [0:12:00] I don't know why I get so affected by other people's behavior. Maybe I shouldn't. I mean, I shouldn't (chuckling). (Pause) (Sniffing) [0:13:00] (Chuckling) I've <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">just been thinking about the workshop. There's this woman I don't like in there. She used to be a friend, but we had a falling out. I might have mentioned this to you. And yeah, just recently, [since this] (ph) new semester, it's just, like, I want to slap her. She just makes me so mad (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">She got the flu, and the first week she didn't come when I was handing out my submission. [0:13:57] But I put it in her mailbox. She couldn't get it. And she's like, [I'd really appreciate if you could please] (ph) send me an electronic version. I couldn't bear this part of the workshop, and I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">feel comfortable sharing. It's like, it could end up anywhere, you know (sniffing)? So I didn't reply to that. And then the week of... when my submission was discussed, and she absolutely had nothing to say. She's like, I just [got it] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">And two weeks later she still hadn't answered. And I was like, give it back. You're supposed to... it's your duty to comment and give it back the week of the discussion. Okay, you didn't get it, so give it to me the next week. Nothing. I had to ask... I had to beg for my own manuscript. And she's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">oh, I can't do it next week because I'm turning in my submission. I'm like, just give it back without comment. [0:14:56] What... I mean, I don't expect you to give me any useful comments anyway, so... because she hadn't done that in the past. The manuscript's completely clean. There's not a single word on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">And yesterday, she was being discussed. And I was... I had decided not to... to return the favor and not give her any comment at all. But I couldn't help myself. I was like, that's too mean, I shouldn't do that. So I commented. But she didn't say thank you. She didn't say anything. I guess she's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">supposed to, but I just expect that. And the teacher was... he brought in a book for her and was being nice (inaudible at 0:15:41). I was so annoyed by that (chuckling). It's completely irrational, but... (Pause) [0:16:00] Just like, why aren't you nice to me? Why don't you suggest books to me? [Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">he thinks I don't need it] (ph), but that's not true. (Pause) (Sniffing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I don't know why I get so belligerent (chuckling). [0:16:57] For... I don't know, attention or something? (Pause) I guess I get surprised that... am I that needy? I didn't think I was. (Pause) I'm like, if I'm not that needy, then why am I not just content in giving feedback? And why does it bother <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">me so much that she hasn't given feedback or she hasn't been friendly or she hasn't done this, this, and this? Why am I holding her to that and finding her falling short? And why is that bothering me so much? So she's sneaky (ph) and she's not as disciplined and attentive. I mean, that's not a crime <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">or... [0:18:00] (Pause) I mean, there are all sorts of people out there. People are actually dumb. They're actually stupid (laughing). (Pause) And when I read a new book, (inaudible at 0:18:30) (chuckling, sniffing). Seems like I'm spending a lot of time getting overawed by smart and underwhelmed by <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">the stupids (chuckling) instead of just focusing on myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559488\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: You see... you sort of see yourself and other people very much in a hierarchy.

You do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: You think of me as an equal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: In some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Sure. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: You don't think I have less or I have more or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: No. I think people bring to the table different talents, different vulnerabilities, different strengths, different... yeah. [0:21:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Well, that's very mature (laughing). (Pause) Why do I think the other way? (Pause) (Sniffing) It's quite nice, it's quite liberating not to think that way. It's quite fun (chuckling). But... (Pause) Maybe it comes from my dad perhaps? (Pause) I mean, he was very judgmental. [0:21:58] And [it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">really] (ph) horrified me to even try to remember the way he was, not just with me but with everybody. He made our life so miserable because of that, because of his attitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: How is he judgmental?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Well, for... yeah, he was always judging us all the time. You couldn't breathe without having him judge. And my mom was supposed to be not clean, not a good housekeeper. Yeah, everything. She couldn't do this properly or that properly. And these were his words. So... and she has a very severe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">inferiority complex now. She can't... she's very unsure of herself in every single thing. [0:22:58] Like, the littlest thing. She has no opinions of where to go to eat, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: So he was judgmental but in particular putting people down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, and we couldn't hang out with anybody. Any of my friends, any friends that I made... first of all I wasn't allowed to go out and play when he was around. And even up until we came here, one of my... somehow I made a friend, and she came over. And he was like... and my dad just woke up <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">from his nap. And she and I were just in my room, and he just started cursing as he walked down the stairs. I mean, I remember that moment so much, and it really horrifies me because I'm just like, oh my God, what is she going to think? And later on I learned that her father was just as abusive (chuckling). <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">[0:23:58] But still, it's like I think my honor was destroyed in that moment. (Sniffing) I want to present a good front, that I'm a nice person and sweet and funny, whatever. I mean, this was when I was 15 or something. And I was so horrified by that, that here's my father cursing and not wearing a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200593\">shirt and walking down... (Chuckling) I don't want that. Take it away. And I was like, I want bright, cheerful, and sunny (laughing), happy. (Pause) [I don't know if I explained that well] (ph), but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559488\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">And everybody was either bad or not up to his standard, below. [0:25:06] It's... yeah. Or if they were better then they were unkind and selfish and they didn't want our best. So my uncles, my mom's brothers, they were well off. But... so according to my dad they're selfish, and they don't... because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">they don't send my mother money (chuckling). And they're not supposed to anyway, but anyone else that I meet... say, for example, that girl in my school or... they're not good enough. And this was the case throughout my childhood no matter where we lived (chuckling). [0:25:59] So... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">And Chris is judgmental, too. I mean, I'm living with him, so... (Pause) I also kind of sense that he doesn't think too, too... well, I mean, he says he does, but he can be condescending a little bit, too. Well, not condescending. Dismissive, without being aware of it. (Pause) [0:27:00] But I... this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">discussion and this woman, she was talking and asking questions. And apparently she had a very corporate vocabulary? I didn't notice it because I'm not attuned to that. But she's also a dancer, and... yeah, so at the end of the discussion Chris... I mean, they were all standing around, and Chris asked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D2\">this girl, where did you learn to talk like that (chuckling)? She was like, I don't know (chuckling). I was like, what do you mean? Where did you learn to talk like that (chuckling)? I thought it was a bit rude, a bit too forward. [0:27:57] I mean, he hadn't spoken to her at all. He didn't know her <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D3\">at all, and he didn't know her name. So he goes up to her and says... (Pause) (Chuckling) I mean, it was supposed to be a light moment, but I wouldn't have prefaced... I wouldn't have said that to someone I didn't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It's kind of aggressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, and he's not usually... he's not known to be aggressive. (Pause) So yeah, I was thinking between my father and now him, Chris, seems to be judgmental world. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Two people? You're extrapolating the world from two people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, but look at my world. It's really... I mean, these are... one was a father, this is a boyfriend of seven years, come on (laughing). [0:29:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: I understand. In your world...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: There are judgmental people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, they're very influential people for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: (Laughing) So... I mean, I would love to... I mean, I agree what you're saying, two people does not make a world. [And I should] (ph)... it can be so much bigger. But the reason why maybe I'm judgmental is because my world really was small (sniffing). (Pause) But how do I exorcise myself of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">these two people's way of looking at things? (Pause) [0:30:00] (Sniffing) That is why I was kind of relieved (inaudible at 0:30:38) Victor doesn't seem to judge. He seems to look at people at a level... all at one level. But I'm thinking it's only because he can have access to as many women (laughing). <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">[0:30:58] But... I mean, that's not the only reason, but... [and then] (ph) he has all these other problems. (Pause) Well, but it really was a relief, like an actual physical relief, like, oh, thank you, you know (chuckling)? It's like someone's loosened a really tight bra (laughing). Like, ah, I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200713\">breathe (laughing). (Pause) I can see more things, taking off blinders. (Pause) [0:32:00] (Sniffing) [0:33:00] But aside from judging people do you think I also expect too much from them? (Pause) [0:33:58] And then, if they don't meet that expectation, then I judge them.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559488\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: I feel like your questions are often statements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, they're a question at the end, a question mark (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: I understand that you... I understand that they are structurally questions, grammatically questions. But you have an idea, and clearly it's your idea. And you think that it's partially true, you wouldn't have come up with the idea. But then you don't own the idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Well (chuckling)... well, each question's an idea, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you don't say, I wonder if, or I think that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: I just truncate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Right, but it's sort of like, rather than it being your idea, you want me to endorse it or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, there's questions like that. [0:34:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: But why should I have that authority? It's your idea, and you think there's some merit to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: No, I mean, you can disagree with me about that. [I mean, that's] (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: And I'm happy to... if I think that... if I disagree or something, I'm happy to chime in. I think I usually say something if I have a question or if I'm wondering something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: But yeah, I mean, the way I think about it is a bit of disowning it, not taking authorship of the idea. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Could be (chuckling). (Pause) [0:36:00] Because I... I just said that because I did... I do at times see it's a level field and people bring different things to the table. And I didn't think that, oh, he and I are going to have this degree (ph), and I'm very (inaudible at 0:36:45) so I'm better. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">So I'm just not... I'm just going to absolutely not associate with any of them. That's not how I was. I didn't just want to appreciate the different talents of the women. [0:37:02] That's why I approached this woman, to be friends with her. I didn't care about how well does she works and all that. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">just came out... it just came to that point where I didn't want to associate with her. But the fight was over an insult from my side and an unanswered e-mail. I felt ignored and, yeah, taken advantage of a little bit too, so... (Pause) [0:38:00] It's often like that, I suppose, that someone hurts you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D3\">emotionally, personally, and you just kind of push them away on a different basis. Like, they're not... (Pause) [0:39:00] But what's the solution to it? I'm not sure. (inaudible at 0:39:09) is not by ideal (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess the solution or the end goal is to be able to separate out their sort of personal issues with... you're seeing it as a slight rather than, she's got her own stuff going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: There's not necessarily the intent to be rude or neglectful. She's got her own things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) But how can you ignore someone who's helping you so much? Every single thing she had submitted to the class she'd send to me first to edit. [0:39:57] And I invited her to Thanksgiving dinner, and there was absolutely no response from her. So, I mean, of course she has her own things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">going on. But if I'm inside her head I'd be thinking... I would think, oh, yeah, I could... she's helped me. I should at least say no if I can't go, you know (chuckling)? Unless there was an earthquake or something severe like that that kept you from picking up the phone and texting. It's not like we <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200952\">don't have that kind of relationship. I mean, (inaudible at 0:40:48). It's not like that. I mean, she came (inaudible at 0:40:54). [0:40:56] So it seemed very petty of me to hold her to that and hold the... respond (ph) with hurt and not let go after so many months (chuckling).

I don't want to suffer myself. I mean, I'm talking about myself. It's... forget about what I'm doing to her, it's mostly to myself damage (ph). I don't want to do this any more. [0:41:56] I don't want to get angry and hurt just because people I expect things from don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">give them to me. Or... yeah. And then have to fight and break off the whatever, friendship, slash, acquaintance. (Pause) Don't I have other resources to turn to if I feel neglected and ignored? Why has it become so dramatic? Why does it get so drastic? It really does. [0:42:55] I get very, very angry <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200972\">(chuckling). It's like I'm on the edge all the time with people.
