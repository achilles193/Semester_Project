Yeah. It\u2019s mostly been a bit cold and windy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So yeah, I still have been really not feeling great. I don\u2019t know. Here\u2019s the getting it\u2019s kind of I was at a sci-fi convention, a big local sci-fi convention this weekend. Didn\u2019t I explain my anxiety about how I had to stay with friends and ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you had been, I think, hemming and hawing about whether you were going to go or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I ended up going, and so, the convention\u2019s at the hotel Westin convention center of [inaudible 00:01:35], like, a big Westin, and something like three thousand people. And last time I went it was more like two thousandish at the plaza. It was really intensely noisy and aggravating in that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">like, [sigh]. There were lots of people in various costumes, which is usually very fun, like, I like that. But I was getting frustrated at people with big costumes, or big costume parts, like, blocking into the aisle, or whacking into you. And then a lot of people were excited to see each other and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">shrieking all weekend, and then there was the drunk talking too loud in the elevators, and just ... It was like... over stimulating isn\u2019t exactly describing it. It\u2019s like, wow. These are a lot of really kind of mildly annoying things, usually, really ramped up and in one space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Way too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes, like, way. And I wasn\u2019t really usually I\u2019ll start out at Convention and be like \u201cAww, guys. You\u2019re all over the top but that\u2019s okay. Teenage girls in Dalek costumes, that\u2019s great!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: In what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Um, Dalek costumes from Doctor Who. Daleks are these evil robots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It used to be that they could only move forward and backward on a flat tread. Stairs defeated them. And then in the new reboot someone was like \u201cHa ha! We\u2019ll go up the stairs!\u201d and then they levitated. One of the things that, these cute little teenage girls, they were wearing little, cute, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">prom dancy dresses, that looked the Dalek robots. And I was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cute, you know.\u201d People do a lot of re-interpretations which is usually fun, but... I sort of never had that, \u201cOh everyone\u2019s really jammed in and kind of crazy and annoying, but I still love you\u201d moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I just sort of was \u201cOh my God. I hate everyone\u201d. I mean, and also I had a complete freak out before packing because I couldn\u2019t find a bottle of painkillers. I had a bottle of Vicodin and I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. So I got super stressed about it, like tearing apart my apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Sorry. What\u2019s hurting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: My hip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: That did used to hurt. I know I haven\u2019t heard for awhile, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked about it for awhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s not constant, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s kind of like, well, you know, it\u2019s comforting to have the concept of it more than anything. And also, like, walking around a lot, blah blah blah. I don\u2019t know if I really could say [inaudible 00:05:39] for awhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: And then I was like, \u201cOh shit. I have to leave right now\u201d. So that was just a little bit much. But it was weird. I didn\u2019t exactly I wouldn\u2019t say I had a good time, I wouldn\u2019t say I had a bad time. It was mostly just a lot, is how I felt about it. And the sort of ... there\u2019s a significant downside <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">of... like I am acquainted or passingly familiar or friends with a ton of people there, so there\u2019s, like if I\u2019m sitting there talking to someone, there\u2019s always a string of people that are like \u201cHey, how are you, blah blah blah\u201d and it was just like \u201cHello, but I\u2019d really like you to go away right now\u201d. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">Or just, like, it was hard to just sort of hang out and talk to a few people quietly. Other than like, my hotel room. Even in, like, I had dinner with some friends in a restaurant pub attached, and of course a whole bunch of people ended up walking by our booth to go to their table. And I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D3\">I guess I kind of missed, everything\u2019s always been kind of... it\u2019s big and kind of overwhelming and kind of noisy, but I really miss not having any sort of, not really having the initial, \u201cOh, everyone hi!\u201d or hanging out in a group of more than four people. So that was frustrating, and the thing I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D4\">had forgotten, or made myself forget, is, Arisia\u2019s panels are really disorganized and half-assed and it drives me crazy. People, the panelists always talk to their friends in the front, or they\u2019ll be like, \u201cI\u2019m not prepared, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here\u201d. I\u2019m just like \u201cAAAAAAAGH\u201d. So even though I knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D5\">that, I tapped out of two panels within ten minutes. I just it was too frustrating. So there was that. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t buy books because the dealers\u2019 room was too big. I just ...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562028\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Sorry, the what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: The dealers\u2019 room was really big. It\u2019s like a... I don\u2019t know what else to call it. You know, like a big convention center space -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh, you mean it was really big to go in, and look around for stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know, usually there\u2019s like, there\u2019s some books out, and t-shirts, and sort of sci-fi tchotchkes. There were a lot of them. A lot. Kind of. Like it was, I just felt like I can\u2019t figure out what I want through this really loud, anti-Sunday, kind of stank-smelling crowd. Like, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">know, I was just kind of having the, everything that ever irritates me about the sci-fi fantasy fans, it knocked me all weekend. Interspersed with hanging out with people I like and talking to them, and then being really annoyed at people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And have you had that? You said you hadn\u2019t had that experience before, of not also having the \u201caw, great to see you guys\u201d feeling. Have you been irritated to this extent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Not really. Although the last time I seriously attended Arisia, which is the convention, I was really frustrated by, like I\u2019m signed up to do a lot of paneling about race in science fiction, and kind of wanted to murder half the audience, and had someone, [inaudible 00:11:10] basically heckle <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">me over a t-shirt that I have that said Black Nerds Unite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, so ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Those are bad, but different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, because that was just like, I did this panel, I\u2019m like \u201cOh, I hate everyone\u201d, basically, and then I left, and hung out with friends, and then and it was more like, parts were definitely fun, and I did like, there are usually a dozen parties happening or so, and I didn\u2019t go to any of them <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">this year. I just was so, A) I can\u2019t drink anything, but B) I just was sort of like, I think without a little, a drink or something to make this go smooth, I\u2019m like, I need some form of social lubrication here, and being around a lot of really drunk people while sober is boring.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562028\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I can imagine that exacerbating a bunch of things that already bothered you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean being with them in the elevators was bad enough. I guess part of what I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: What I\u2019m wondering about is, in the medication, I mean... I\u2019m, like, these aren\u2019t side effects, they\u2019re part of what\u2019s affecting you. It sounds like the sort of thing it\u2019s supposed to be helping with, and then the other stuff, it would help more with, or whatever, didn\u2019t get in the way... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">I mean I know you\u2019re having a hard time, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m I\u2019m not intending to just blame everything on the medicine, but in that your reaction to this was so different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I mean, part of it was also, yeah. I mean I mentioned before that like, guys yelling always makes me nervous, so a convention hall of guys yelling is perhaps not ideal. So it was sort of this mix of feeling like is this the medication, am I just irritated, and... like for me the biggest frustration, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">and I was talking to Dr. Bond about it, and she was like \u201cWell\u201d, so I went up to I guess the clinical I guess, the amount she wanted me to take of Celexa a week ago. So she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know maybe it\u2019s more time\u201d which, I agree with theoretically. I\u2019m just really not enjoying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">[PAUSE 00:14:52 00:15:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: And I think the other thing is, I\u2019m always, I worry about expressing anger a lot, so even though I\u2019m pretty sure that I didn\u2019t come off as particularly ruffled or whatever, I just sort of, I\u2019ve just been worried about it and feeling like, is this going to get more annoying, less annoying, should <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">I just stop going to conventions this big because it\u2019s a lot bigger than I usually go to, doing this whole, like, I don\u2019t know. I guess part of it was that I don\u2019t feel like I know if I was feeling more irritated just from jump because I\u2019ve been feeling more depressed, or if I\u2019m feeling more irritated <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">because of medication, or if I was feeling more irritated because I\u2019m obsessed with or concerned about feeling more irritated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: I mean, from where I sit, on my hunch it might be the medication. Because it seems to me there are other times you\u2019ve been really pretty low. We need to talk more about it. I wish I\u2019d thought this through more carefully. And the medication obviously may have, but also just, I sort of don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">buy that you get that irritated by being worried about being irritated, compared to how you usually are for something like this, you know? Even if it was so marked, it doesn\u2019t sound like, unless I\u2019m misunderstanding, the kind of difference caused by \u201cI\u2019m just focused on being irritated, which I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">want to be, and yet worried about being, and it\u2019s making me more irritated.\u201d That feels like a small difference but it seems like a big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve been to many conventions, as I understand, and this reaction, I\u2019ve not heard you talk I mean, I\u2019ve heard you describe annoying things or people at conventions, or other things have happened, but this is like, really not enjoying the genre.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562028\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. Part of this thing where I\u2019m sort of like \u201cwaffle waffle\u201d on is, sci-fi conventions vary a lot, and Arisia is definitely, I don\u2019t know how to say it. It\u2019s kind of rowdy. It\u2019s a little bit rowdy, it\u2019s a little bit drunk. It\u2019s kind of focused on sex a little bit. Which comes under the long <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">boring 25-year argument with another sci-fi convention in the area. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So there is more of that stuff than there generally is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the hotel that it\u2019s in, while there\u2019s a lot of space, which is good, the main lobby area is like, it was designed for business conventions, not a ton of people being really social and running around screaming. So, you know, like ... there\u2019s that setup, which is kind of like, it\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">harder to describe. It definitely cemented in my mind that I don\u2019t think I like, at least right now I am not liking that genre of convention, like, which is, I love the costuming that people do, but about half the other things, I was just like no. I just... like having programming running, like, all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">through the night. So they\u2019re doing gaming and movies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Twenty-four hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Basically something is happening twenty four hours, and there\u2019s no, like, dinner breaks or anything, or any breaks built in, so everything just feels like, really, I don\u2019t know, I guess it feels like more, people feel kind of wirey. Everyone seems kind of wirey and jittery, and, like, a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">really quickly. But yeah. I mean I definitely, like, was way more annoyed at people at Arisia than I think I\u2019ve ever been at, say, like, WisCon or one of the other cons I do. ]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">[PAUSE 00:21:32 00:22:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Like, it\u2019s weird that I\u2019m still sort of on the fence about, was it a good use of my time, I guess. I think I\u2019ll just say if I didn\u2019t go, I\u2019d probably spend the whole weekend being depressed about it, if I didn\u2019t go, and being like \u201cawww\u201d, but also going wasn\u2019t entirely great. And the other thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">was so due to some poor planning or timing on my part or whatever, I end up, I wanted to leave the convention and run to my apartment Sunday evening. And so first I went to a friend\u2019s house, we were going to have dinner, and someone was going to drop me off at my house. And it didn\u2019t end up happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">until a lot later, and they were really exhausted, so I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay the night\u201d. And it\u2019s these friends of mine, Emma and Damian, who ... their house is borderline hoarder house and it makes me super stressed. Partially there\u2019s stuff piled everywhere and there\u2019s really not places to sit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200873\">And it reminds me of an ex who had very similar, piles and piles and piles and piles of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: And I like, I would have skipped, like, I would have rather skipped going over there for dinner. Even though I did end up having a great opportunity to hang out with my friend Wanda for a couple of hours, and blah blah blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Really annoying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, the hoarder house part just always makes me like, \u201cagggh!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, you had just been overcrowded all weekend, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562028\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then having to kind of pick your way around big piles of stuff, and then they decided to get four kittens recently. Which -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of kittens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, they only have two now, they\u2019re getting two more. And all I could think is, that\u2019s the worst idea ever. Also their apartment has wall to wall cream rugs. Yeah. I\u2019m like, this is not going to go well. In the room where the kittens are right now, it\u2019s already like, just gross. It\u2019s covered <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">in black cat hair. And yeah. The other thing which is not related to me being angry at a sci-fi con is, I managed to, I don\u2019t even know, not notice that the new semester had started for school. Yeah. And it started last week, so that\u2019s not too bad, but never actually done that. I\u2019ve gotten close, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200972\">... Doing that makes me, I had sat down I think Friday and was like, \u201cOh. The semester started. Well, fuck it, I\u2019m not going to do anything with it this weekend\u201d. And then I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll sit down Monday and work on it\u201d, and then didn\u2019t want to. And then today, I was just like \u201cuuuugh... don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200973\">want to again\u201d. And part of it was I really miscalculated how... so [inaudible 00:26:59] to get together this week long something about multimedia stuff. It\u2019s kind of a conference in my library so there\u2019s like, keynotes each day with a catered lunch, like a bagged lunch, and workshops or discussions <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200974\">running every day, so it\u2019s like, two workshops in the morning, an hour and a half keynote at noon, and then afternoon workshop. Some are just talks, some are hands-on. And so, you know, like, I\u2019m just completely not involved in it. Wasn\u2019t asked, wasn\u2019t anythinged. Which, like, on the one hand, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200975\">like working with him, other hand I find it both insulting and kind of baffling. He really just doesn\u2019t like ... So Paul\u2019s been really stressed about it, but hasn\u2019t asked me for any help. I offered to help, he was just kind of like \u201cHmm...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: So ... It feels frustrating and insulting and I\u2019m also a little bit glad that I don\u2019t have to deal with it but I guess part of the frustration is that people have been asking me lately, \u201cOh yeah, that thing your department\u2019s doing\u201d. Yep. I\u2019m not involved. It\u2019s technically not my department, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">it\u2019s technically another group that\u2019s half of my apartment. And then I got reminded that the main multimedia site at the [inaudible 00:29:32] doesn\u2019t list me as a member of the department. Yeah. List of multimedia consultants, and, Karl and Chet, and then someone who doesn\u2019t work for the library, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B2\">then some other people, I\u2019m just like \u201cWhat? Okay.\u201d The keynote today was a post-doc of African American studies, and the sort of title was \u201cStorytelling, and African Diaspora, and African Americans, and Multimedia\u201d. So I was pretty excited. Initially they were supposed to have this other professor <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B3\">who\u2019s amazing, who has done data visualization about Haitian slave revolts, and that was just super amazing and he\u2019s very interesting. And so you know, I go trip in for the keynote, and the post-doc is this white woman that I\u2019ve met before, and I was just like, \u201cOkay, this is a little weird\u201d. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B4\">there was very low attendance, and I was the only black person in the room, and I feel like maybe there were two people who aren\u2019t white but also aren\u2019t US citizens, if that makes sense. From Malasian libraries. I\u2019m just sort of like \u201cHmmm\u201d. And the post-doc being white wouldn\u2019t necessarily have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B5\">a problem on its own, I\u2019ve certainly met her before, but it just all coalesced into me feeling really frustrated and uncomfortable and not being able to leave easily because her talk she was being filmed. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562028\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I see, there would have been film of you getting up and walking out. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s just like, you know. I wish I had my laptop then I could use the Internet. Part of what she was talking about, her talk was disorganized in a lot of things. Part of what she was talking about was the African American Studies sophomore seminars where they learn about how to do community <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">outreach, and how to do anthropological studies and interviews and blah blah blah. So it felt very weird to have a white woman telling presumably mostly black students how to study and talk to black people. In the end that was kind of like, the nut of it, I was just like, \u201cHmmm, this feels very uncomfortable\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I would imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">It was not touched on at all. Also part of her, in part of her talk she was discussing how a lot of her African-American and African students didn\u2019t do a lot with technology and are underrepresented in the tech field. And it\u2019s true, the tech field is very white. Her comment was, it\u2019s because they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">not being encouraged to go into tech, [inaudible 00:33:47] and we don\u2019t see it as a possibility, and we just need to be encouraged. And I thought, no, that\u2019s not really actually the problem. The problem is systemic racism, but sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You mean through both the educational system and the technology field in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Right. You know, one reason, I mean it ends up being sort of circular, but it\u2019s similar to thoughts of like, why aren\u2019t there a lot of women in IT? Well, they get harrassed and it\u2019s really frustrating, or assumed to be inferior and they don\u2019t get hired, so why would you do that? I found her <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">idea that just encouraging them through a sophomore seminar is fixing the problem to be incredibly naive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Ironically sophomoric, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: She\u2019s like, one person\u2019s decided to do a secondary, like to start CS, computer science classes, so they can create a startup. I\u2019m like, computer science classes and startups have nothing to do with each other. Uuugh. Which is probably part of why I didn\u2019t want to do anything with my class today also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You mean because of how you\u2019re feeling from that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And also, I mean, a lot of what she was talking about, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I did as an undergrad in Folklore and Mythology\u201d. Some of these things that she\u2019s talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Sorry, did you say you did your undergrad in -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: No, so some of the things she\u2019s talking about are things that I did as an undergrad in Folklore and Mythology. So like, going out into the community, and collecting stories, and interviewing people...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see, yes. That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So like anthropology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yes. So part of me was like \u201cI already know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d. The other part of me is thinking \u201cWhat you\u2019re describing as being really innovative isn\u2019t\u201d. So part of her, \u201cThis is so amazing and innovative\u201d, was recording people on film. Well, digital film. I was just kind of like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">\u201cI want to tell you, film exists, and it has for awhile\u201d. And it\u2019s interesting that they, students try to turn them into videos, except they didn\u2019t do it very well, so that was kind of weird. And then she had a whole about updating Wikipedia, because Wikipedia doesn\u2019t have a lot of information about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">Africa, African culture, African diaspora type stuff. And I think to me, that was the only interesting part. That\u2019s actually good, because everyone uses Wikipedia for information. Again, there was something they were updating that another editor had been reverting. There was a little, sort of, tussle <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C33\">over something. And her analysis of the tussle had to do with one editor being more religious and conservative and that was what was causing the tussle, when I think the problem actually had to do with, at least part Ethiopian politics, and who\u2019s been blamed for various bits of corruption or balance <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C34\">or, there was something going on there. I was also wondering, you know, who\u2019s the editor that\u2019s reverting it? Are they Ethiopian? Are they not? Who\u2019s writing this? Are they Ethiopian or not? And also asking one\u2019s source for information and taking that as \u201cThis is the truth which we will update Wikipedia <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C35\">with\u201d, is not really a great practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562028\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: The professor here was really quite naive, incompetent, and kind of offensive too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like, you\u2019re a post-doc at Cambridge, put effort in, come on. And I\u2019m kind of like, part of me is like did you get handed this last-minute, were you not initially supposed to speak? Is this a failure to prepare? Do you really not understand the racial politics? Are you just not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">talking about them? Because you don\u2019t want to be controversial?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: This may be very naive on my part, but I would imagine the white person in African-American studies would have thought about, or like, have had to deal with being comfortable talking about that kind of stuff. I mean, clearly not, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: I would think that, except that I think having a lot of white people who\u2019ve done Afro Am, who are just, who are ... I don\u2019t know. I guess it seems like they just feel like... what? Yeah, that\u2019s the truth. And also they feel like, in their head, they\u2019re like, \u201cWell I can tell whether or not something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">is racialized, and if I don\u2019t think it is, then it\u2019s not\u201d, as opposed to like, \u201cHuh. I should talk to someone else. Maybe my own whiteness is preventing me from seeing something\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Right. And, they won\u2019t necessarily learn better, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it\u2019s also possible to do... I\u2019m curious what she\u2019s studying, what she...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: ... Actually does, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, there are definitely people who have done things like focus on the Harlem Renaissance, the literature of the Harlem Renaissance, and then completely skipped over the politics behind the Renaissance. I\u2019m like, okay, I guess people do that, like in literature departments and stuff, but it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">feels very ... Someone in the English department, just focusing on the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance, ignoring politics, makes more sense than someone in Afro Am doing that. ]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562028\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">00:41:54<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yes, I can see that too. Although even just in literature, by the time you\u2019re a post-doc, you\u2019d think you couldn\u2019t get away with purely looking at the internal structure of the books you\u2019re reading, or something like that, but I don\u2019t really know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: It was just so... and part of me is like, I don\u2019t know, maybe she\u2019s dumbing it down for the audience, or like, partially it just seems baffling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: What I am wondering about, and the answer to this might just be no, is, are you doing that thing at all where when somebody pisses you off, you tend to be a little more critical, you know what I mean? I\u2019m thinking of that story, the Cambridge Business Review story? I\u2019m not sure at all that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E11\">what\u2019s going on, but it did cross my mind to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe she could be that bad. I just ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, so part of the there was an overall issue of, there was some incoherence to her talk, which someone else mentioned, so like, okay, it\u2019s not just me. But I think I definitely, I had a hard time listening, like say she was supposed to talk about something, like, part of teaching <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">them how to do these interviews, she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, teach them how to get to Roxbury on the bus\u201d. I\u2019m like \u201cReally?\u201d That\u2019s a weird statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: And also, among the other things in that statement, it\u2019s like, so Cambridge students not taking the bus, not knowing how to get to a poor area of town, or areas where there\u2019s black people... There\u2019s a whole lot going on with that statement. And so I was thinking about that when she was sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">of going on talking about some other things at various points, where I was just like, \u201cBut, how did you just say that?\u201d So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What I might have caught as well, probably not, but I think I get what you mean, that like, there\u2019s a lot going on there that\u2019s reflective of her point of view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, and also since I\u2019m already familiar with the subject, basically ... it\u2019s quite possible that if I was less familiar with it, although a coworker of mine did comment on the bus to Roxbury thing, without any prompting, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the more I think about it, that\u2019s really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was just kind of weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: So, also, there\u2019s going to be a whole week of this, and I had planned to be supportive and show my face and now I\u2019m thinking \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have to do that\u201d.
