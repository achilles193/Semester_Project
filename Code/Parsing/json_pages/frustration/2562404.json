I don\u2019t remember that. Anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve been really wanting\u2014I need to use FMLA a lot (crosstalk at 00:02:35). And then, I e-mailed, anticipating (ph) they\u2019d be like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d And they\u2019re just like, \u201cYeah, you\u2014well, your doctor hasn\u2019t sent anything in.\u201d So, (chuckles) I just saw her last week. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">I don\u2019t know what happened. Here\u2019s the hard copy.\u201d And then, Friday, I was talking to the disability office. And they\u2014well, basically, like, \u201cOh, so, how much FMLA have you already taken?\u201d  I\u2019m like, \u201cBut I thought I couldn\u2019t do that until you said so.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Wait. Sorry. Couldn\u2019t do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: So, the disability office asked me what\u2014[had already started] (ph) a reduced schedule, had already taken FMLA time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:03:19) I get it.

If I had known that, it would\u2019ve been a lot happier. So, I ended up going home in a really cranky rage fit, because I was just really frustrated. I just want to not be crazy at work like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">And then, yesterday\u2014yeah. I\u2019m at work, doing whatever. And I got these couple e-mails from various senior managers about (sighs)\u2014it\u2019s one of those things where they\u2014I got tagged in mid-e-mail stream.  Some people have (ph) already been talking about something. And then, someone was like, \u201cOh, we should <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">CC some more people.\u201d And it\u2019s some new technology that someone\u2019s using at, I think, a dental school that seems really cool. And then, Karl\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my God. Of course we need this in Aurora and Carlisle immediately.\u201d And then, (inaudible at 00:04:45) is going to be like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B2\">(inaudible at 00:04:47) in IT make\u2014do whatever to get\u2014so we can get this right.\u201d Someone had suggested a pilot. But Karl was like, \u201cNo. We can\u2019t have a pilot.

I think I remember thinking, \u201cYeah, people always want to do this. But they can\u2019t.\u201d I think the actual problem is, is that if you\u2019re not part of FAS, you have to register on the FAS network in Aurora. So, if you\u2019re a consultant, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">can\u2019t\u2014your computer can\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t have a network in our building. Unless you arrange for that in advance. Or if someone is from the law school, they can\u2019t come in our network. I think that\u2019s what people were saying was a problem. That they always want to be able to just use their laptop, but they can\u2019t. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\"> I think that\u2019s a networking problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">I don\u2019t know what the software\u2014I generally don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s software or hardware. (inaudible at 00:06:13) I\u2019m (ph) reading this, I\u2019m just like, \u201cWell, in meetings, people can be on their devices to other things.\u201d And I\u2019m just like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">From the description, I get that it\u2019s used for meetings and\u2014so, that more than one person can share information in some way. But I don\u2019t know what. But I do know that it\u2019s not going to be piloted. And that\u2019s it\u2019s coming in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just going to roll out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which was super frustrating and upsetting, because everything basically\u2014I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat does it do? Do you even know what it does? Is this something that we could solve?\u201d  And (inaudible at 00:07:17) like, \u201cWhat?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: So, you\u2019re saying the only thing you know about it, basically, is that you\u2019re going to be supporting it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. And the suggestion to have a pilot was negged. Someone else was like, \u201cOh, you can come over to the dental school or whatever to check out our implementation.\u201d And the answer was, \u201cNo, no. We should just buy it. And sell it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">I\u2019m guessing probably because the dental school is not close by. But honestly, all the things (inaudible at 00:07:58) cars. They can just drive.  Or take the shuttle. It\u2019s free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: The dental school\u2019s by the medical school, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. You just take the M2 shuttle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:08:06), yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. For free. Yeah. I mean, it takes a while. But whatever. It\u2019s right there. So, yeah, what I know about it basically is that I get to support it. And that\u2019s about it. And then, maybe a 3D printer in Aurora. Because another one of (inaudible at 00:08:33) libraries, it\u2019s getting one. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">not, however, currently planning to buy the software that allows you to make your own 3D objects to print.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: (chuckles) That wasn\u2019t part of the plan. Fortunately, one of my coworkers was like, \u201cYou know, you have to buy the thing that lets you do it.\u201d  So, if (inaudible at 00:09:04) about the unknown. And then, also e-mail from Christy (inaudible at 00:09:12), who\u2019s one of the senior managers, about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">some interesting workshops at (inaudible at 00:09:19), at a local conference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">And [I\u2019m like] (ph), \u201cThese look really interesting.\u201d And then, I realized\u2014and then, I was like, \u201cBut I bet I can\u2019t go, because I\u2019m not a professional employee.\u201d And I don\u2019t have professional [development funds] (ph). And Chet says I can\u2019t go to a conference, because I might work (inaudible at 00:09:42) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">hours in the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562404\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">I read them all in one bunch. And then, I started crying.  And again, I couldn\u2019t really stop. I kind of did enough to be\u2014to decide that I was going to go home. And send (ph) an e-mail. And not forget the student worker, who was in the office with me. But that\u2019s about it. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">And then, today, I found out that there is another another group (ph) department (inaudible at 00:10:38) technology coming into the building that\u2019s going to need to be there at (inaudible at 00:10:43).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s going to what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It\u2019s going into one of the main rooms that I support. Which I didn\u2019t know about.  (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">And combined with that, I met with my labor mentor, Laney, again, on, I don\u2019t know, like Thursday or something. And, well, we had a nice lunch, whatever. It\u2019s getting near the end of the mentorship program, so, she was asking me some questions. And I said that I really feel like the answer is I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">do anything I want to at Manchester. Her response was, \u201cWeren\u2019t you considering leaving Manchester anyway?\u201d Sort of. I\u2019m planning to move to New Mexico. Not really the same as leaving Manchester, I guess. I mean, my plan isn\u2019t, \u201cI want to leave Manchester.\u201d  My plan has been, \u201cI want to move to New <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">Mexico.\u201d And it also felt really dismissive. Like, \u201cWell, I thought you were already going to leave.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">And we talked a little bit. And then, she (chuckles) gave me some printouts of\u2014she\u2019s like, \u201c(inaudible at 00:12:25) here\u2019s some printouts of some articles I saw that I thought might be helpful for you.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou gave me printouts. Okay. That\u2019s funny. [And cool] (ph).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">So, half of them are articles about managing (inaudible at 00:12:44) difficult manager and blah, blah, blah. Which I\u2019d read about.  One of the problems that I run into is\u2014I run into with her is that she\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Well, did you try x, y, and z?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYes.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, but it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">make any sense that Chet [would completely ignore] (ph) you.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d And then, she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, but you must not have,\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m really did try.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: But actually, I did. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: And this weird, \u201cBut it\u2019s not possible that he could be\u201d\u2014or that people\u2014I get that it doesn\u2019t make any sense. And it\u2019s not helpful. And stupid. And (inaudible at 00:13:43). But it\u2019s still happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">So, that was frustrating. And then, she gave me three articles that basically\u2014dress for success. One that like, \u201cYou should dress for the job that you want.\u201d  Blah, blah, blah. And (sighs) I know she meant well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Kind of insulting. Yeah (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: It was insulting. In parts, I\u2019m like, \u201cSo, it\u2019s true that you often see me in jeans and a tee shirt. I have to crawl around on the regular. I never know when.\u201d And my first response really was, \u201cCan I direct you to the articles that I publish on this topic?\u201d Of (crosstalk at 00:14:40). Yes. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not really doubting you. I\u2019m just (crosstalk at 00:14:45) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was like, \u201cI have a published body of work on the topic of how clothing, your (inaudible at 00:14:52) appearance does indeed affect how people react to you.\u201d And that sucks.  In particular, an article that was why\u2014respectability politics and why it\u2019s really rare. I may be dressed very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">casually, but it\u2019s really hard for me to dress crazy sloppy, because, in my head, it\u2019s like my dad and all my relatives being like, \u201cYou can\u2019t go out of the house like that because what people will think.

The way she came in with, \u201cHave you thought of wearing pantyhose?\u201d Or I don\u2019t even know. \u201cHave you thought of not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">wearing jeans?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYes.

I guess what I actually meant was I\u2019d like a mentor who\u2019s a person of color who is willing to talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">discrimination in the workplace. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562404\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I imagine it would be helpful to have a mentor who also has some similar (inaudible at 00:21:06) views.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I mean, it sounds like she wasn\u2019t taking in all that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">well where you were coming from.

And with Chet, I mean, I think she definitely feels like there\u2019s something that I\u2019m not doing. There\u2019s something I\u2019m doing wrong. Or something.  She did say she\u2014I think that she found it perplexing or confounding.

And taking things that you\u2019ve learned from other parts of your life into your work.  Or asking work to consider things you do that aren\u2019t technically librarian-y <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">to be considered as professional development.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562404\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">So, three (chuckles) of us are discussion queer activism, \u2018zine making, other kinds of\u2014working with LGBT, homeless youth, that\u2019s three (chuckles) of us. And the other two are so\u2014are\u2014their non-traditional things are a little more traditional, I guess. I can\u2019t remember. I think one of them\u2014one person\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">talking about some kind of (inaudible at 00:26:52) she volunteers with some people, like a youth group, like (inaudible at 00:26:58).

It\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to be different. She has a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">experience of working with youth than\u2014if\u2014like when I chaperone gay prom.

But also, it brings up, like you said, I\u2019m less likely to consider it a (inaudible at 00:28:13) skill because it\u2019s all gay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Right.

And also, some of the stuff, I\u2019m just like, \u201cI would like to discuss the mass amount of organizing I\u2019ve done with (inaudible at 00:28:25), but I really hope that discussing a (inaudible at 00:28:27) group right now.\u201d (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">And it\u2019s really hard to\u2014you\u2014it\u2019s hard to explain some of the\u2014there just ends up being cultural context is where I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t think that most people know how annoying it is to organize lesbians.\u201d Because everyone knows the\u2014how you should be talking, (inaudible at 00:29:02) whatever.

And maybe I\u2019d be better off using whatever Harvard prestige, wink, wink, wink, somewhere else. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">know. Cal Tech, Leslie (sp?), wherever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">And I\u2019ve been wanting to stick it out. To finish the degree.

And then, I anticipate wanting to face plant for a while. And then, start looking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: At least a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: At least a year. Yeah. And I also (inaudible at 00:36:16) I don\u2019t know how long that job search would (ph) take. Or any (inaudible at 00:36:23). But realistically, I (inaudible at 00:36:25) for a year.

And I don\u2019t have an answer. (inaudible at 00:36:42) other part [of what\u2019s tricky] (ph) is that (inaudible at 00:36:48) work is one of the things that has been very difficult emotionally \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: to deal with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t know. I mean, yeah, work is that thing that\u2014I\u2019m not feeling great for a variety of reasons. But the things that set me off and crying or feeling super defeated have all been\u2014not all of\u2014mostly been work stuff. So, there\u2019s that. I\u2019m not sure that I can find a way to have Paul not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">be my manager. Or to work in different space. Or a bazillion things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">The things that would make work much more tolerable to me I don\u2019t think I can get, mostly because that they, \u201cWell, it would look bad. What would people think if you changed desks?\u201d Or changed managers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t recall, in any conversation I can remember you telling me about, in which you brought something up that mattered to you to somebody at work.

But, understandably, you didn\u2019t tell me about those, because \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: we talk about things that (inaudible at 00:39:56).

I feel like half\u2014I\u2019m just being\u2014I\u2019m being defeatist. Maybe there is a way I could talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201291\">to someone. And they would actually listen. But then, I think, \u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty sure that that\u2019s not going to happen. But hmm.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being defeatist. Nor do I think that it\u2019s how you\u2019re talking to people that\u2019s the problem. I do wonder why you\u2019re doubting yourself in those ways. Having (inaudible at 00:41:23) within so many conversations that have not gone that way. Do you know what I mean? It <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">seems like more of\u2014much more of a no-brainer to me than to you.

I don\u2019t get a lot of affirmation when I talk to people about it. I get what I was getting from my mentor, like, \u201cOh, but that can\u2019t be possible.\u201d Or, \u201cYou should go fight that and talk to someone else.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cCool story. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">Already tried that.
