They write up different writers. []. I didn\u2019t like the way it ended, so I\u2019m very pissed off at him. I have to write him a letter. You\u2019re just going to have to write another book within a couple of months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Let me go over one thing about schedule.

It might not even affect us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I will write on my handy-dandy pocket calendar with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It won\u2019t affect us.

Oh, my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: A little high, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(laughs) Hopefully I get to see him next Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: So she needs your sugars to go down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: And the weight to come off. I guess she just really blasted out Winchester. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Why doesn\u2019t he get my sugars under better control? He\u2019s not giving me enough insulin. In the morning when I wake up it can be 117. Sometimes it might be high, maybe once or twice out of the month; but at nighttime \u2013 oh yeah. I\u2019ve tried to stop eating after 6:00, which is kind of hard because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">sometimes supper is not until 7:00. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been hard to get that evening number . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. He finally went up on my units in the morning. I have to take 28 units of insulin. And then at night time it\u2019s like 19. I don\u2019t go for the 19. I always give it 20. I thought why go 19? Why not go for an even number, like 20?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Do you have to measure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Some people use a syringe and a bottle. I don\u2019t use that.  I have a pen and all you do is put the needle on top of the pen every time \u2013 a different needle every time \u2013 and down here is a dial and you just dial one units, two units, all the way back. I just click it to 28 in the morning and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D1\">said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like odd numbers. I\u2019m odd enough. Why just not go for 20?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I got it. I thought you said 12, like the 19 was too much. It\u2019s 20.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. First he started me off at eight units in the morning and three in the nighttime. Then it got to 16 units and then it went to 23 and now we\u2019re up to 28.  Now we\u2019re starting to see a new twist in it. He wants me to see a nutritionist and the nurse to work with me on nutritious meals. (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">She came in and she said, \u201cDo you eat cheese?\u201d I said, \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cDo you eat yogurt?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cDo you eat cottage cheese?\u201d \u201cNo. Don\u2019t you understand? I don\u2019t eat cheese.\u201d \u201cDo you eat fish?\u201d I said, \u201cOnly if it\u2019s fried.\u201d [ ] (inaudible at 00:07:40) She said, \u201cDo you eat chickpeas?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200512\">any kind of peas, lentil beans, nothing.\u201d That\u2019s gross.

No veggies for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I like veggies but I never cared for kidney beans or lentil beans, anything like that. Baked beans I don\u2019t mind, but you\u2019ve got to put sugar on them. She said, \u201cYou can\u2019t put sugar on them.\u201d \u201cWho says they can\u2019t put sugar on baked beans?\u201d [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:28)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: So what are the typical means you have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Today I got up early because I went to coffee hour. I had oatmeal, but it wasn\u2019t that old-fashioned oatmeal, just the instant oatmeal with maple and brown sugar.  [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:05) But then I\u2019ve got to put cream on it. I don\u2019t like milk on it; I like cream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Do you make it with water or milk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Instant. I had that and I had my cup of coffee. Then down at the coffee hour one of the ladies took cracker and put peanut butter on them and there were peanut butter and crackers on the table. I had one of those. Another lady came in and had made this big round thing with the Pillsbury rolls <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">and she put ham and cheese and stuff in it, so I ate a slice of that.  Then at 1:00 I made myself a sandwich and it had ham and Mortadella on it and that was it. Probably tonight when I go home I\u2019ll have a bowl of cereal for supper and that will be it. Some days I can\u2019t eat breakfast and I don\u2019t eat <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">lunch and I just eat the one meal at suppertime. [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:23) I\u2019m getting turned off of meat. I\u2019m not crazy over chicken anymore. I\u2019m not crazy over pork chops anymore or a piece of steak \u2013 no. I do eat it \u2013 last time I had half of a pork chop. I\u2019m just not interested anymore.  I like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D3\">eating a baked potato for my dinner. I like a half a stick of butter on a baked potato. I don\u2019t mind that I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter. That\u2019s not too bad. I don\u2019t mind putting salsa on a baked potato.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not good plain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll eat just about any kind of vegetable except for parsnip and turnips. I bought Brussels sprouts and fiddleheads and all that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not going to make it boring. You\u2019re not going to take away the flavor if my life, the good flavor in life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: No. I don\u2019t like cottage cheese and goat cheese and feta cheese.

That\u2019s on a good day. I can\u2019t even stand the smell. You know how you go to the stores and they specialize in cheeses? In one door and right back out. Can\u2019t stand the odors.  You should see me go to the fish market when I go to get lobsters. Hey \u2013 I\u2019m the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">one in the out doorway.

All you can smell is fish. I\u2019m out in the hallway with the Lysol spraying it. Kelly is out there. (laughs) It\u2019s brutal. He goes fishing, ankle fishing in the river,\u2013 ugh. Do you have any glow-in-the-dark fish there? He brings home some really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">smelly stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Is that right? And then he cooks it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. One day we were out in the backyard and cooking on my barbecue and he says, \u201cI give you fish? You fry?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d No stinky fish on my grill. So we\u2019ll see what happens. There goes my candy bar. I just bought ten boxes of Girl Scout cookies. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Do you like those?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Which kind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I like the Thin Mints. I like the Samoas; they\u2019re the ones with the coconut and caramel. I like those. And then I like the peanut butter ones \u2013 not the plain peanut butter ones \u2013 but the ones with the chocolate over them.  Then I like the sugar cookie that has chocolate on the bottom of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Like the full?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I was thinking about \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is the case for you, but it is a source of pleasure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like this, I have a hard time eating the solid foods because I\u2019ve started throwing up again. When you look at my plate there is not much on my plate because I can\u2019t finish it all.  If I overeat, that\u2019s when I start with the heaving, but put a piece of cake in front of me and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">piece of cake goes down with no problem. The cookies go down with no problem. The bowl of ice cream goes down with no problem. It\u2019s the regular goddamned solid food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: The cookies are okay though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. I learned to be a dunker. I never used to dunk my cookies, but I learned to stick them in the coffee and get them all soft. It\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Is it different than eating soups?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Soups I can eat. Of course, I\u2019m fussy. I only eat my soup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Soup that you make?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It\u2019s good, but the other stuff is kind of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: When I make a home-made soup there is everything but the kitchen sink in it.  There is celery in it; there are onions in it; there are carrots in it; there are crushed tomatoes in it. Sometimes I\u2019ll put cabbage in it. Sometimes I\u2019ll put escarole in it and sometimes meatballs. Yeah, I make all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">that stuff. I like it like that. Give me my cooking. Kelly sent over some home-made soup for Deborah last week because Deborah had a cold. Deborah said, \u201cI ain\u2019t eating that stuff. It\u2019s got all this stuff floating around in it.

I said to him, \u201cI was supposed to come in and see you next Tuesday, but since your kids are on vacation you decided to take that week off. Where do I get my prescriptions because they\u2019re out on that day, the 18th? Did you want to give me [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:54)?\u201d \u201cOh, no. You\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">supposed to write out narcotics ahead of time.\u201d  \u201cWell it\u2019s not that. If I take them to the drugstore they\u2019re not going to fill them anyway because they\u2019ll only fill them when the insurance says it\u2019s okay to fill them, which is the 18th. So who is going to write them?\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019ll have them here.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A12\">I said, \u201cI just don\u2019t believe you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have the best track record.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Strike one. Then you went for strike two. I said, \u201cThis will be strike three if they\u2019re not here and you know what that means \u2013you\u2019re out.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d I said, \u201cShould I? You don\u2019t have too good of a track record with me lately.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re more than free to leave and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">get another doctor.\u201d  I said, \u201cDon\u2019t think that thought hasn\u2019t crossed my mind because I\u2019m working on it. What about my B12 shot?\u201d I\u2019ve always had my B12 shot on the same day I see him, so it\u2019s like when I see him, then there is the B12 shot and the script \u2013 so that\u2019s three things. I said, \u201cCan I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A52\">my B12 shot now?\u201d \u201cWell, no. It\u2019s a little bit early.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So the girl comes in and she goes to make the appointments and she says, \u201cI have your vitamin B12 shots. I can get you in with the nurse on the 28th.\u201d Now that\u2019s a week after it\u2019s due. He\u2019s in with another patient now. I said, \u201cYou <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A53\">page him on that phone and tell him I want to speak to him because if you don\u2019t page him, I will knock on the door myself.\u201d  I\u2019m like a raving maniac by now. I said, \u201cThey can\u2019t see me. I came and saw you today. Next week I\u2019ve got to come back and get my prescriptions and then I have to come back the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A54\">following week? That makes two extra appointments for this month and I already have ten appointments I have lined up. Do you know how much that\u2019s going to cost me? It\u2019s $8 every time. $4 up; $4 back. I can\u2019t afford $80. $100 a month for transportation.\u201d \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know it cost that much. I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A55\">know you had to pay for it.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you think they do \u2013 give it for free?\u201d Luckily they did go down to $3.  I\u2019m not going to tell them that. Still, ten visits a month is $60. Then if I use them to go food shopping, that\u2019s another $6. He said, \u201cWait a minute. Let me go find the nurse,\u201d and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A56\">he goes out and he can\u2019t find them. He comes back and he says, \u201cOh, yeah. They\u2019re going to take care of you on the 18th.\u201d Okay. I go up to the desk because the girl can\u2019t make them in the office because she can\u2019t open up time in the doctor\u2019s things. I said to the girl, Mary, \u201cI need to see you next <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A57\">week for my B12 shot and it has to be after 1:00 because that\u2019s when he\u2019s going to have the prescriptions \u2018in the building\u2019 for me.\u201d So she goes into the scheduling.

When Deidre was small Deborah would have a pair of tongs, taking the diaper to the diaper pail. I could come home from work and Darla would be yelling, screaming her fucking head off. All she wanted was to be held and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201051\">rocked. She was so upset. \u201cIt\u2019s spoiling her.\u201d I would take that baby, put her in my arms, give her the bottle or whatever \u2013 out like a light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">THERAPIST: But Deborah, though, how would she react to Darla gone?

I can hear that, but what it is, is I don\u2019t hear out of this ear at all because all I hear is a ringing sound all the time, so I\u2019m just completely deaf in this ear. They don\u2019t cover hearing aids. Mass Eye and Ear do.

She wears a sloppy old t-shirt that\u2019s six sizes too big for her. Her hair is just a mess. She looks like a slob, messy.
