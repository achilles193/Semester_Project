(laughs) I was pushed behind before then, I just didn\u2019t move fast enough. (pause) I had tea with Camilla, who is one of the priests <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">at my church, who is doing Greek. Before Greek she missed a class and so I sort of caught her up, but mostly we just had tea and talked.  It was really good. She talked about the discernment process. I think she\u2019s probably in her early to mid-30\u2019s and certainly the youngest priest by 10 or 15 years. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">I think she was the most recently ordained. She said she thought it would be sort of torturous for me, not because people would be hard on you, but sort of the opposite. Her prediction was, \u201cWell, you\u2019re young and you\u2019re decent looking and you have the bare minimum of social skills and you\u2019re a woman. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">They\u2019re going to want you to be a priest, so nobody is going to say anything negative about you.  I feel like you\u2019re sort of like me, and that\u2019s going to be really hard.\u201d (laughs) I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m actually saying what she said right. I think the point is . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking that she could have given you more credit than the bare minimum of social skills. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I feel like even that is sort of stretching it a little bit for me sometimes. I know I\u2019m actually quite good in social situations, but I always feel like I\u2019m really not good at it.  I think the point of the process is to have some sort of rigorous self-evaluation of suitabilities and unsuitabilities; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">and also to have your congregation and a whole bunch of people that know you do the same thing for you and talk to you about that. It sounds like that\u2019s more of an ideal than a reality in some ways. (pause) It was a nice talk. (pause) I feel like for Greek, I end up just talking for 45 minutes today, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">talked at people and then was like \u201cdo you have questions?\u201d  We\u2019re at a point where, basically, all I can do is present the material and do questions as they arise. We didn\u2019t have any exercises to go over today and they\u2019re not really far enough along. We\u2019re not at the point where we can translate passages <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">or [dig into] (ph?) stories. I am not at my best in that kind of . . . It\u2019s not really where I feel comfortable or do my best work. I sat in the public garden and talked to Amanda and watched people walk and talk. (pause)  Yeah, it was a nice day. I mean like it\u2019s a nice day outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: (laughs) It hasn\u2019t been a bad day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that didn\u2019t quite make sense, but now I understand it. (both laugh) It\u2019s not like you were saying it\u2019s been a bad day, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Like I was that enthused about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right. Neither the content of what you just said or teaching. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m starting a new project of making things. I took a class at William &amp; Mary called Myths and Stories. I took it because I thought it was going to be like an anthropology class where they talk about myths and stories, but instead it was one old mystic trying to make his internal emotional logic <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">into real logic. (laughs) It was a terrible, terrible class. There are a lot of students at William &amp; Mary who have taken the class and really loved it, sort of one that everybody knows about. He\u2019s been teaching it for like 20 years.  He\u2019s incredibly sloppy with terms, so he would take a word that had <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">several different valiances and he would use it in one valiance and one context and another valiance and another context to try to make them be like \u2013 See? We\u2019re talking about the same thing. No. No. No. That\u2019s the same word, but it does not mean the same thing. He was just doing that over and over <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">and over again. I did what I always do in boring classes, which is I write out poems, all the poems I have memorized. I write them down. So it looks like I\u2019m taking notes. (laughs) I would draw these Celtic knot-style designs, like the Book of Celt-type things, which I\u2019ve sort of been doing since high <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">school, so they\u2019re pretty beautiful and pretty complicated, on a sheet of notebook paper.  I decided to start tracing them and embroidering them with something that would hang on the wall. Since nothing I do is organized, I spent half an hour looking for these designs and flipping through the notebook <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">where I had a couple of notes like \u201cthis is really crap\u201d comments and one-sided conversations I had written with the person sitting next to me. I was like 24 at the time. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562072\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">I feel like I\u2019m a lot better presenting the appearance of respect than I was when I was 12. Now I\u2019m much better at actually just focusing in class. I could focus on the class and that would just make me want to punch a wall, (laughs) so I always just do other things. I would draw those when I was in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">the hospital also. There was just not much to do and so I would just need a pencil and a piece of paper and I would just sit and draw. I would draw in my room or in the common room. I don\u2019t know where those are. They\u2019re somewhere around. (pause)  It\u2019s something that takes the right amount of attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Like knitting or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. It actually takes more attention than knitting, which is good. I feel like knitting I have to be either totally focused on it, like if I\u2019m trying to figure out how to do the shaping or what to do next, or basically my hands are moving and I\u2019m talking or watching TV or whatever else is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">going on. This is very meditative and calming for me. (pause)  I can draw and listen to what somebody is saying and actually hear them, but I can\u2019t really draw and have a conversation at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: I see. Or like watch TV or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:27) If you\u2019re looking for fights there are lots of fights you can have. This is like there are a lot of people there and everybody has got their own story. There are a lot of abrasive people there. (chuckles) So that was one way to . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Both there and in the class there are times when you also felt pretty abrasive and drawing the knots was common that way, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It sort of externalizes the way you felt tied in knots or what but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) It really is a good outlet for my perfectionism because it\u2019s all freehand, but there are pretty geometric patterns in freehand so it\u2019s sort of trying to make everything exactly right. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562072\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: It seems to me you taking on the imperfections you feel in the people around you and trying to deal with them inside you, rather than in place of maybe trying to deal with it in relation to the people outside. Most of your frustrations with the hospital were ways other people were doing things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">wrong \u2013 or in the class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: So I try to sort of fix that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: It seems like you sort of take that in so you focus on something that\u2019s about your own imperfections or efforts to get things right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean to be reducing your doing this to that entirely and saying that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, but seems like one dimension of it. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I had a lot of time to kill. (pause) In some ways, my impulse is often to stay in my room, but that doesn\u2019t really go over that well.  Being with a lot of emotionally-noisy people sort of felt like I was trying to make some space for myself in there. The alternative way to make space for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">myself is to try to be more noisy than anybody else and that\u2019s just . . . I mean, there is no way I was going to win that one. (laughs) That wasn\u2019t a good place to be. (pause)  I\u2019m thinking of one girl in particular who was super-manic and had psychotic episodes on and off and was sometimes violent, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">mostly not. I got along with her most of the time. Just one of those charming people or very magnetic in some ways, but (pause) she wasn\u2019t very good at recognizing that other people were people outside of her.  The one I really remember was during some group and she basically was like, \u201cYeah, all you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B3\">people with mood disorders have it super easy because having a personality disorder is a lot harder and we actually have to work to get better.\u201d I just left. I didn\u2019t feel like I could respond in a way that didn\u2019t escalate the situation and I didn\u2019t want to stay for that, so I just left, which is pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B4\">characteristic.  (long pause) I gave her this shirt that says \u201cFeelings are boring. Kissing is awesome.\u201d I think I told you that. It was a shirt that I was never going to wear and she was totally going to wear it. (both laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I remember the shirt, but I didn\u2019t remember that you gave it to her. (pause) I think, actually, part of what gets difficult in a situation like that is . . . I don\u2019t know. My hunch is that when somebody sort of not just steps on, but stomps on your toes in a pretty big way and you walk out, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">I imagine you\u2019re walking out, to some extent, on your own reaction, as well as on the actual interpersonal situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I really just want to strike back in some way that feels very violent and scary for me and I want to say something hurtful; so I just try to shut that down first and see how I should actually respond later. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I would imagine that\u2019s not the easiest thing to acknowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. Once I sort of have my breath back I can say I\u2019m angry about this, but that\u2019s sort of first in-the-moment reaction.  Yeah, I\u2019m just afraid that I\u2019m going to hurt somebody, which I don\u2019t like. That seems like the worst possible thing. (long pause)  Teaching was good for me because it sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">of forced me to realize that it\u2019s not the end of the world when you lose your temper because, yeah, in high school I was like . . . (laughs) I think I only yelled twice or maybe three times in the entire year, but I know I yelled once and I know it wasn\u2019t much more than once. [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:01) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562072\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">I found with the kids this week I was very short. I just wasn\u2019t in a good mood. I was really cranky. I didn\u2019t lose my temper, but I wasn\u2019t in a good place. (pause) But I don\u2019t know [what I could have done about that.] (ph?) (pause)  Both [Sharon and Keller] (sp?) are entering sort of obstreperous spaces. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">I think Keller could be starting school and Sharon is learning how to talk and has desires that are more complicated than what is easy to do. (laughs) That doesn\u2019t help, but it\u2019s not really about them. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: I guess to me it seems like you waivered there a little bit between, as before, making it about what you have or haven\u2019t done well in that with them. You\u2019re frustrated with yourself. You were too short. I sort of entertain the idea that they were being more difficult. But then kind of moving <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">back to well, it\u2019s really not about them.  I don\u2019t know what the reality is. Certainly maybe it\u2019s your temper this week more than anything, but I don\u2019t know. Little kids can be a pain in the ass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, but they\u2019re always a pain in the ass. (laughs) It\u2019s a constant of small children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: How is that any different? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well some weeks I handle it really well and this wasn\u2019t one of those weeks. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not being trying, but they\u2019re always trying. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but I imagine they have better weeks and worse weeks, too. They do have more [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:48)  I guess my point really is there is something about your probably putting it on them in front of me that makes you worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. Vivienne, my sister-in-law, has a three-year-old and I was watching a neighbor\u2019s kid who is like seven months old or maybe eight months now. She just complained about this kid constantly. She said he\u2019s an enormous handful, like just impossible, like he just cries all the time. He cries <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">for no reason, she says. There is no reason for him to be crying. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, Vivienne. Fine. Whatever.\u201d  So over Christmas she brings her daughter and this kid over and I\u2019m like it\u2019s a baby. It\u2019s not particularly fussy. Not an angel, but not particularly fussy. She put him on the ground and he <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">started fussing and he doesn\u2019t even cry loudly. He\u2019s a quiet crier. She\u2019s like, \u201cGod. You see?\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay, I think he just wants to be held.\u201d I just picked him up and held him for the next hour and a half and that was it. That was all he wanted and it was really easy to do.  It just seems to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200513\">me like that\u2019s a lot more about Vivienne\u2019s dissatisfaction with her own life than it is about the child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not the baby\u2019s being upset that really bothered her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. Although babies crying gets under your skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Sure.

But I really do think that it is about me this week. It\u2019s also sort of impossible to tell because when I\u2019m grouchy, that makes them act out more. It\u2019s sort of a feedback loop.

Yeah. (pause)  It would be easy in the sense that everybody knows that little kids will drive you insane.

But even if it\u2019s more work, I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">think it\u2019s safer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: That makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: I guess I imagine there is something quite disturbing about someone seething the way she was or the woman on the [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:16) you mentioned being the way that she was. You really worry about being like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. I really don\u2019t want to be like that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I guess I sort of think that you\u2019re also like I\u2019m sitting here and I\u2019m trying to listen closely and I would really know immediately if you were being that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think there is a little bit of stereotypes of therapy entering in that there is nothing \u2013 like I can change myself but I can\u2019t change the people around me.  I feel like a lot of the pictures of therapy that I have is that they sort of help people stop saying that if these things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">are external to me were different, then I would feel better and say, \u201cWell, no. What can you do in yourself that will change it?\u201d I can\u2019t talk anymore. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going to have to stop talking. I\u2019ve been talking all day and my mouth is broken. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019m smiling because . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t make words anymore. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: It was more because I had the thought that the way you need to change is to . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: . . . think more about yourself and really identify yourself as to what you need to change and everyone around is fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Surprisingly, I find that model very comforting. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s not the direction. (both laugh) I don\u2019t always be that light and flip about it, but I think that\u2019s something that I think you\u2019ve already seen pretty clearly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it feels pretty apparent to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: But (long pause) I guess the way you seem to be applying that therapeutic model in a way here does, as you say, keep you safer and it means that you\u2019re the one who sort of has to build more of the walls to keep it feeling in and clear and understood because if that stuff gets out over here <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">where I can see it or towards me . . .  In other words, if the regulation is happening between us rather than your doing it kind of on your own \u2013 I don\u2019t know if danger [is a problem and other things, I guess.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) I just get so scared. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re mostly really scared because you kind of start to think that way. I mean about therapy, but about each of these situations, I think. We kind of hinted about the taking back in yourself very reflexively, I think, and without seeing that and it must be because you\u2019re so frightened.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562072\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah.  I was talking with [Larry] (ph?) about you being in the hospital and what that meant for me. And one of the things that I thought about a lot in terms of theology was that I find both in myself and in talking with other people who have been hospitalized for suicidality that there is this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">tendency to want to sort of separate oneself from all the people who should be hospitalized. There is us and then there is me and then there are the really crazy people. That just doesn\u2019t hold. It\u2019s not how it is. I don\u2019t have psychotic episodes, but I do feel like I have some sense of that sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200852\">fracturing of self that comes along with a lot of things.  It has become really important to me to say that it\u2019s not us and them, it\u2019s just us. I don\u2019t feel like, in some ways, there is not that much of a difference between me and \u2013 well, there is certainly no difference between me and Amanda, who has <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200853\">never been hospitalized, and between me and other friends of mine who deal with depression, but have never gotten bad enough to . . . But what that means is that we\u2019re all just really, really vulnerable all the time. I feel like I\u2019ve gotten better at dealing with that in some ways, but I just keep sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200854\">of coming up against it.  (pause) If the kids are going to be monsters one day, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. I can react as appropriately or as inappropriately as I want, but I can\u2019t keep them from making my life miserable. (laughs) (crying) If James decides to leave me, I can\u2019t do anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200855\">about that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: Like it\u2019s so hard not to want to find ways to pretend you can protect yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Because it feels so raw. In a way it\u2019s dangerous. [Not like trying to hit the kids that are bad,] (ph?) but overwhelming and difficult and [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:27).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause)  It just feels like these very small ways in which I reflexively reshape the situations such that the onus is on me to fix it rather than it\u2019s just not something I can fix necessarily, it feels like it doesn\u2019t matter how big or small the situation is. It\u2019s just as terrifying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">because every situation is the same problem like I can\u2019t fix it. I can\u2019t be safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s humungous all the time, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. There is a sense that feels more like I can either look at it or I can look away. (crying) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: I imagine it\u2019s a little bit reassuring to be confronted here with that vulnerability and feel like, at least in this moment, it will be more or less okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s not awful to think about or to feel what that\u2019s like.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is something that . . . (pause) Yeah, talking about it helps. (long pause)  Eventually you have to lose your temper in the classroom and the world doesn\u2019t end. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Sounds pretty frightening, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) More afterwards than in the moment, just because mostly I was just really mad. (laughs)  When you don\u2019t yell at the class for five or six months and then you do yell, they shut up. (laughs) (long pause)  It\u2019s helpful to talk about the things that are really wrong [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">at 00:53:02) that are affecting me. I\u2019m just so into that. I\u2019m so far into that attitude of if I can\u2019t change it, I shouldn\u2019t talk about it or think about it or take it into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562072\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad that that\u2019s helpful and that makes sense to me. I may have been unclear. That\u2019s not quite what I meant. I also agree with that. I\u2019m glad to hear you say that, but what I had in mind is [ ] (inaudible at 00:53:58) all the time, like just now when you got upset.  I think you feel that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">same kind of rawness. I think we should talk about the vulnerability and at some point you feel it; and then you\u2019re going through it and my sense is that that\u2019s terrifying, as it always is, but also it can feel a little contained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.  One of the less good side effects of talking about vulnerability a lot in my writing and in my conversations with people is the more I talk about it, the less I can actually connect that with how vulnerable I actually feel. It\u2019s like the conversations sort of take steps away from what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">I\u2019m actually living. (pause) This is on me and I will avoid that at all costs. (laughs)  I sort of feel like I\u2019m trying to learn how to swim by throwing myself into the deep end over and over and over again. (laughs) I\u2019m not very good at it. (pause)  I think James is planning to apply to a position <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A12\">at UCSB. Did I say that? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s actually applied there yet.
