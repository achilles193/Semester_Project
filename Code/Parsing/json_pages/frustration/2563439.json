(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">I\u2019m still bothered by not asking that girl out on the bus when I had the opportunity. On the bus again, I mean, we just didn\u2019t she was talking on the cell phone, so it was like a missed connection. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: There was a chance after the one that you described last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: There was a chance of something, yeah. I don\u2019t find her very interesting. It\u2019s just I should have a deep relationship with someone in my life, I guess. My friend pointed out I mean, I had a what else happened? Every time I go to class, I feel like girls are kind of coming at me and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">just even like moths to a flame, but I sort of botch my opportunities in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">There was a girl at class this Tuesday who I thought was like 19 but she\u2019s 23. She was wearing they have this new style of stockings. It\u2019s not like fishnets but they have these patterned designs. She had this like see-through blouse and stuff. And so I mean maybe it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t say anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">and that she\u2019s dressed kind of seductively, that I just perceive her as sort of a sexual object or objective. But, I mean, she came up to me after class and said \u201cAre you waiting here long? Where are you going?\u201d and that kind of stuff. She wanted me to tell her about her work and what I thought of her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">work and this kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I frightened her off. I didn\u2019t know what to say about her work. I asked about her age. I started smoking a cigar (chuckles) because that is what I had planned to do after class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: And she wanted to know your she was interested in your opinion of her work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Ostensibly, yeah. But to me, that\u2019s just a gateway to something else. (pause) [There was an opportunity there].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Sure, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I mean, we agreed to meet next week but it was just I said \u201cWhen and where?\u201d and she said \u201cOh, let\u2019s figure it out next week.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Oh, uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: So to me, that\u2019s just \u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s not going to happen. I mean, it could [but to me, it\u2019s probably not going to happen].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: How did you feel when she approached you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: It was good because I was just waiting there, hoping for something like that to happen. Also the professor was there and he\u2019d seen me walk off with the other hottest girl in the class the week before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">And so I felt kind of proud that, you know, I walked out with one and then the other. The other one I had taken from him. They were talking. This girl looks like [] and they were talking, very thoughtful, [almost neurotic], serious. Blonde, blue eyes, pretty. [I might be getting old though]. But they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">were talking and I sort of approached her and I don\u2019t know if they were talking about class or who knows what they were talking about but I walked out with her. So I felt this validation thing where I feel some cheap validation at being perceived as some sort of womanizer or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: But that you can kind of that you\u2019ve got some like influence, power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: That he would see too, that he would recognize in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean, the awful truth is that I\u2019m terribly inept. Well, apparently not terribly. (chuckles) (inaudible at 00:06:28).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563439\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well something though it\u2019s kind of like there\u2019s this kind of ability that you\u2019re finding about attracting, appealing, finding women that are interested and then something turns. Something turns for you. I mean, because the whole yeah, something leaves you feeling like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">mean, I guess that\u2019s why I was asking like what happened with that girl when she approached you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">It sounds like you liked it. You did something evidently to attract her interest, but then something kind of you describe it like something then comes undone almost. (pause) What happens? Like the woman with the stockings. What kind of followed from there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: (pause) I mean, it\u2019s kind of a theory, but what actually happened is during class we were supposed to review her work. We didn\u2019t get to because she submitted it very late, and so the professor just said \u201cWe\u2019ll review this later. I can only look at the other submission.\u201d But I had spent the 10 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">minutes before class sort of looking at it in the library and making corrections and then I gave it to her in class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">And so (pause) Yeah, so she I was leaning on the door that was going to exit the building, sort of waiting for something to happen. The professor came and started talking to me. She came and she said \u201cOh, are you going to be leaving soon?\u201d and I said \u201cYeah.\u201d Or she came up to me and she walked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">so I\u2019m leaning like this on the door. She walks around me like this and then she kind of walks back and she\u2019s like \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d It just didn\u2019t make much sense what she was doing in terms of leaving or coming or going. She says \u201cAre you going to be waiting here long?\u201d and then I said I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">know, I just followed her, I guess, and went outside. Then I got outside and the professor leaves and she plants herself and starts holding her books or whatever like this, and starts asking me what I think about her work. She\u2019s facing me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">And then I start getting us walking because I want it to lead somewhere. I want it to lead. I imagine she lives nearby or she has a room or something, so I say \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d But she\u2019s following me is the thing. I\u2019m in front of her by a quarter pace. I\u2019m just saying \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">she says \u201cOh, my car is in that direction\u201d so we start going in that direction. I\u2019m taking out a cigar just because I planned to have the cigar after class because I needed to use it. I don\u2019t know. I thought it might impress her a little bit too, I guess. So I was just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: But you were feeling kind of pretty good about, like \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got her walking. We\u2019re walking.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, so walking, walking. But she\u2019s asking me about her thing. I said \u201cWell, I could bullshit you, but really I need to think about it for a few minutes.\u201d I asked where she lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">I\u2019m getting like a lot of information very quickly. I\u2019m sort of walking slowly. I think she just wants to stand there and talk, but I was sort of but she was willing to follow me walking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Were you wanting to go back to her place? Was that the idea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I was. I said like \u201cWell, do you want to go to Starbucks?\u201d because that\u2019s right across the street. \u201cWant to go to Starbucks and talk about it?\u201d She said \u201cNo, I have to meet some friends but how about next week?\u201d or something like that. So I said I think this is how it went. And we\u2019re sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">of walking [on our way there]. So she said or I said \u201cAre you old enough to drink?\u201d and she said \u201cYes.\u201d (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563439\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">So we just started talking about her age. I thought she was like 19 but she\u2019s 23. [That sort of nonsense]. (pause) But I mean I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Then what happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Then what happened, we go out of the gate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: How do you feel at this point, by the way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: How am I feeling? I\u2019m sort of finding my way. I mean, I think she\u2019s expecting from me some stability. I think women expect some sort of stability yeah, maturity and stability but I\u2019m sort of groping at how to carry this, like where to carry it. What to do with it. Because if we don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">stop somewhere to talk or if we don\u2019t find some common ground but I can\u2019t talk about her work because it\u2019s pretty crappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: At least not without some hard thinking. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: \u201cI need some time to be able to bullshit you.\u201d (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: [Yeah, there was a concept there].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: [In her writing]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: [In her writing, yeah].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I mean, I said (inaudible at 00:12:37). But at the gate, she just said \u201cOkay, well, see you next week\u201d and I said \u201cSo where and when do you want to meet?\u201d She said \u201cOh, well, we\u2019ll figure it out next week.\u201d I\u2019m there trying to wipe my cigar because it\u2019s not lighting up. [And that\u2019s how it goes].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: What were you feeling when you asked her that? Like what did she -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, when like she goes you know, she\u2019s obviously taking off at this point. I get the sense that you\u2019re like, there\u2019s some urgency you felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Oh absolutely, yeah. I mean, it\u2019s like a small panic because it\u2019s not it\u2019s done, it\u2019s finished.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: \u201cNext week\u201d means \u201cNo.\u201d Next week means nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Right, you don\u2019t have anything really tangible to walk away with, yeah. It\u2019s kind of yeah, right, it\u2019s nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: \u201cNext week\u201d means I blew it or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Oh, you blew it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s not like that\u2019s very visible to anyone, but that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay, okay. What makes you think you blew it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: (pause) We didn\u2019t meet. We didn\u2019t (pause) It\u2019s like planes passing in the night. I mean, there was no common ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: We didn\u2019t have sex. We didn\u2019t even go out to have anything to eat. So, I mean, you have to imagine too, during class I\u2019m visualizing what I\u2019m going to do to this girl and how it\u2019s going to happen, because I sat next to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. What were you tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: I think she\u2019d suck a good dick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: She was dressed for it.

He said \u201cOkay, now you can. I\u2019ll never do that again.\u201d But it\u2019s been done again. I mean, I need the money and I know I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201471\">do well. But I also took it personally because I\u2019m always stretching every single customer. I mean, he could see that I was sort of hurt when someone would say no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">I mean, I would take someone who was in service for an oil change and get them to commit to buy a car if only they these people lived in Delaware so their trade-in was in Delaware.

No, you\u2019re right. There\u2019s no pleasure in good indicators.

It\u2019s like \u201cdo\u201d or \u201cdo not,\u201d there is no \u201ctry.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">THERAPIST: I think you get ambivalent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: I think you get ambivalent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: Not with the girl though. I don\u2019t think so. I definitely do at later stages. But I guess options open up and I don\u2019t know exactly what to do. Are we going to her car? Are we going to her room? Oh, she doesn\u2019t live here, so what do I do know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Did you know what you wanted to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: At the point when she actually approached me, it\u2019s just a good sign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: Getting to know her would be alright, I guess. And I checked her. She has like a website. I checked her website. She\u2019s like a legitimate person. She\u2019s not just a slut or something. I mean, she does like advertising work. She writes the whatever in advertising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Writes copy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: Copy, yeah for TV ads. She does (inaudible at 00:33:22) that kind of stuff. (pause) Yeah, but I\u2019m constantly thinking like \u201cOkay, what are we going to do at this moment that I\u2019m talking to her? You know, Starbucks? Go out for a drink?\u201d [Should\u2019ve gone out for a drink, probably].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: See, that\u2019s where some sort of question something comes up at those moments where you shift from feeling like \u201cI\u2019m leading, I\u2019m leading,\u201d then you reach some sort of point and you start to think about options.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20182-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20182-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563439\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">But some new feeling kind of enters into the mix. I don\u2019t know what it is exactly. (pause) And I was wondering too, did you want her to respond? Did you want her to respond in some way at that point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. (pause) That\u2019s just it, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I\u2019m seeking that nurturing maybe I\u2019ve drank too much of your Kool-aid already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">THERAPIST: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m seeking that instead of nurturing breast or whatever. When I asked \u201cDo you want to go to Starbucks?\u201d what I\u2019m saying is \u201cAm I okay? How am I doing?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Because if I knew what I wanted, I would\u2019ve just said \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to dinner.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: But instead what I\u2019m actually seeking is some sort of validation, constantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean it is another facet of what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not just about the blow job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Or the influence that gets you to the blow job, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">CLIENT: (pause) Wait, what was that? It\u2019s what I want? Influence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not just the influence. It\u2019s not only just to exert the influence and for her to see her as kind of to really kind of be interested in you. Masculinity, male, that kind of realm of it that\u2019s important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">Yeah, sure. Something else enters the mix about what does she want to give me? Nurturance, whatever. Something about, does she want to go to Starbucks though with me? Not just it\u2019s a different realm than being the influencer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: That you started to want as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah, she asked what I did too and I just said \u201cI sell cars\u201d [] (pause) Yeah, I\u2019m at work and I mean, I do what I\u2019m told. Sometimes it\u2019s just contradictory now. I\u2019m a low-level employee and I do things without thinking about them, and then I get in trouble because the things didn\u2019t make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">I mean, I just did what I was told but I\u2019m sort of taking the flack for it. I get contradictory orders and things. (pause) I should be in a better situation. But I don\u2019t feel that confidence that I know what to do with a customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a link here though with a customer and the girl, you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Well, what do you do with a customer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know where to guide them. I don\u2019t know that I want to sell them a car, I guess. (chuckles) Or that they want to buy a car, more importantly. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">I see them. I don\u2019t know how to get them from where they start to where they should finish. The only people I\u2019ve gotten are people who know what kind of car they want. I haven\u2019t been at all good with people who aren\u2019t sure what they want. If someone comes in and they know basically what they want and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF1\">they pick it out, then I sell it to them. Otherwise, I don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">The other thing is I got home from work. I\u2019m living with a refugee. We have I invited him out to dinner because I wanted to normalize him into our society or something. He\u2019s kind of crazy. I mean, he reminds me of myself a long time ago. Everything he does, to him, represents like the image of home, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C11\">his (inaudible at 00:38:52). And he\u2019s concerned that if he behaves this way or that way, it will poorly reflect on himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563439\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">He\u2019s like, you know, physically affected if he makes a bad impression. He\u2019s also incredibly confident, by contrast. So like you don\u2019t realize what kind of world he comes from until he goes to Target and he says something like \u201cWow. This is bigger than the largest store in my country by ten times.\u201d He <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C51\">doesn\u2019t know how to use a can opener or things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">But I invited him out and we talked a bunch and flashes of who he really is sort of shine through. I mean, he\u2019s someone who looks at a situation and sees what\u2019s better, what\u2019s better than this. Then he\u2019s absolutely convinced that what\u2019s better is what he wants. Then he struggles for what\u2019s better using <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C71\">whatever means he can. Then he gets there. Better, you know. \u201cShit, good.\u201d Just very clear distinctions between what you want, what you don\u2019t want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB\">He ended up paying for half the meal though. I was going to cover it, but he paid for half the meal. I felt kind of conflicted. I said \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay\u201d and he said \u201cNo, please\u201d and I said \u201cReally, it\u2019s okay\u201d and he said \u201cPlease take the money.\u201d He actually offered more than half what the bill was. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB1\">He didn\u2019t see the bill because they gave the bill to me. It was like $54 and he gave me $40. (pause) So I gave him 10 back, so I still covered more than half because with a $10 tip it was $64-something, so he paid 30. He\u2019s from fucking Africa and he\u2019s telling me about how he\u2019s on the buses, like worrying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB2\">about paying $2 extra for going this way and $2 extra going that way. [And I\u2019ve been there too].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\">I mean, my situation isn\u2019t that good, but still. I mean, I had a negative balance yesterday. But I at least know (inaudible at 00:41:09). (pause) But I can understand that. I mean, if someone wants to be treated as an equal, you should do that. You shouldn\u2019t coddle them and say \u201cI\u2019ll pay for you\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF1\">or whatever. So I thought that was good. It was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">CLIENT: The waitress was great, one of the best waitresses I\u2019ve had. But then this other lady, she asked me there was soy sauce and they were cleaning up because it was the end of the night. So she asked me for the soy sauce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">They have this weird thing. It looks like a ceramic cylinder and then there\u2019s like a spout on the end that looks like a handle. So I just moved the things towards me and the soy sauce spilled on my shirt. So, I mean, a $10 tip for $50 is good. It\u2019s perfect, actually. But I still felt like guilty or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">THERAPIST: About?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">CLIENT: Well, like I might\u2019ve given more. I expected the meal to cost $80 but it cost $50. (pause) Yeah, I felt bad because I didn\u2019t give more of a tip. I felt righteous too to make that guilt but you know, I spilled soy sauce. I had to pour lemon juice all over it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Oh, she did it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">CLIENT: Well, she asked me to move it and I moved it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Oh, I got it. When you moved it to help out, you spilled it on yourself. I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, and we were still talking. She was just like \u201cExcuse me\u201d and she breaks into the conversation. It wasn\u2019t even the waitress, it was someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">CLIENT: But just because of that, I couldn\u2019t give a full tip. It was just terrible. It really affected the whole conversation too. We were getting really involved and then I worried about my shirt.
