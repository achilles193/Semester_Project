data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Okay, but now what if I told you about something that was like child endangerment? Would it be you to call up the child endangerment or I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Well, somebody. It depends on the situation, but if it was, if it was a child was in some sort of danger that you knew about I\u2019d have to say something. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Okay. I\u2019ll tell you about it when I can write back. Oh well. I can just do it in my arm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Do you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Everything\u2019s in the pen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so much easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: But, maybe, Louise, I can help you figure out what to do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. Well, it\u2019s my cousin, Laura, as usual. Devon had come down two weekends ago with the boys and James is James. A typical four year old boy. Well, Laura retired from work at the age of 50 and what she does is she still stays home all day and sleeps. Well, I guess, James one day decided he <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">was going to flood the bathroom downstairs in the basement and when Devon came home, the water was up to the door so that it would go out under the door and out to the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">So, when Devon came home, the water was just flooding out. There\u2019s James sitting in a bean bag in the middle of the floor floating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Having a hell of a good time. Where\u2019s Laura? Right upstairs in the bedroom, asleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Another incident was he had a buzz cut and Louise says let me show you why he has the buzz cut. Well, he got in to the electric razors and shaved a big, big chunk right out of his head and then a few on the side. And, I said oh, how is he doing at night time? Does he go to bed for you? Oh, yeah. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">give him melatonin which is over the counter and we give him two pills and he\u2019s asleep like that. You know, what happens if all of a sudden he as a reaction to the melatonin or he thinks it\u2019s okay to take because mommy already gives it to me and takes it. I mean just giving it to him to begin with I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: What? You don\u2019t want the doctor to know that, you know, you want sleep medication for your son. So, you buy over the counter stuff. I\u2019m afraid it would build up in his system or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah. They should have a, yeah, I mean, like, they should be having a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: To talk to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: You don\u2019t give that to a kid under four. Under five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well, they should be talking to their pediatrician about all that if they\u2019re going to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: I mean I know it\u2019s over the counter. You know. But, big deal. Over the counter. I mean that would be something I would take. Not a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Who was telling you about this? Devon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Devon. So, then he comes up with this I have finally come to the conclusion that there\u2019s something wrong with Laura mentally. I said you\u2019re finally coming to the conclusion. I said let\u2019s face it, she doesn\u2019t even work anymore. She retired from work at the age of 50 because it was too tiring <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">for her. I said I know she has a lot of migraines. She winds up in the hospital. They send her home. She\u2019s home in bed for three days. There\u2019s no one watching the children. Mother is down in Georgia, so Jackie\u2019s not even near to help her out, and as I said, the kids are on their own again. I mean, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200412\">know, James goes to school, but he doesn\u2019t go all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099713\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: But they\u2019re going to, yeah, she\u2019s off in bed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Kind of just sleeping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: And, she sleeps in a dead sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What, does Devon think she\u2019s using any kind of drugs? Pain medication. You know, too much pain medication or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Probably like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: That kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: No. No. She probably needs medication is what it is. Now, Mary said there is such a thing that is called chronic fatigue and it\u2019s diagnosed. So, quote why doesn\u2019t Laura see if that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with her? I mean, she\u2019s a young woman. 50 years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. She shouldn\u2019t be this tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: The kid\u2019s needs aren\u2019t getting cared for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: The way they need to.

Quote, fend for ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: What did, when Devon called you, what was he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Well, he came by with the two boys because I had some shirts for them and everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: When was the last time you had seen them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: James was two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. It\u2019s been two years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: I missed his third birthday. I missed his fourth birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t know it had been that long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Oh, boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. During the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: The summer two years ago?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Of 2011.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes. You know. And, I wouldn\u2019t mind. James is no worse than Albert was when Albert was his age and I started babysitting him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: And, Albert would stay up until 11:00pm at night and they thought that was fine. But, now, all of a sudden, James, he gets melatonin. I\u2019m going to pick up a bottle and see what the, what it says on the directions and who can have it and who can\u2019t. But, I know it\u2019s not good for children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: How did Devon describe it to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: He, he\u2019s like, I said well, how\u2019s he doing sleeping at night? He goes oh, he sleeps fine. We give him two melatonin\u2019s and he\u2019s out like a light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Oh. Okay. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: By 7:00pm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What did you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: I just didn\u2019t say anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t say anything. Yeah. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: He says it\u2019s over the counter. I just turned around and shook my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: But, then he went on to talk about Laura\u2019s mental health problems?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. About how she retired from work and I mean let\u2019s face it, she got a good pension. She worked in the school system for like 25 years, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">THERAPIST: She had been doing this since she was in like her 20\u2019s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, she\u2019ll get a pension. Yeah. Yeah. But, she\u2019s not being able, she\u2019s not able to kind of function as a mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">CLIENT: No. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: As far as, you know, what you\u2019re hearing from Laura. Yeah. Is Laura worried about it? How is Laura?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">CLIENT: He\u2019s just like ha, ha, ha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Okay. Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">CLIENT: I mean A, he flooded the toilet while his mother was upstairs sleeping. Isn\u2019t that warning number one? He shaved his hair. Warning number two. Another time he went and got up to the bread box thing, got out the bread, ripped a hole in the plastic and put it, buttered it and put it in the toaster. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD1\">And, that was when he was two. So, I mean. I think to myself, well, you know this kid is floating around in a pool of water. What happens if you have an outlet right here and the water goes in the outlet and he puts the light on?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099713\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: No. I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: He\u2019d fry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

That, that you\u2019re concerned and you certainly feel like, well, Laura needs help and if she\u2019s going to be, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D31\">she needs help being a mom right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">CLIENT: They\u2019ll tell Jackie. I\u2019ll get another nasty phone call from Jackie to say stay out of her children\u2019s life. Devon and I have a plan. Well, they thought they had a plan two and half years ago and nothing has been done about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">CLIENT: You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What, what, what is Devon, does Devon have any thoughts about how to help Laura out? Has he been thinking about, does he feel like she should get some help?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">THERAPIST: He doesn\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: Well, he probably does, but he won\u2019t admit it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: You know, he just goes with the flow. You know? So. I, you know, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: How would it go if you talk to Devon about your concerns? Would he, would he, I know you might call Jackie, but would he, how would he react?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">CLIENT: No, because he\u2019s afraid that the boys will be taken away from them. You know, they\u2019re not married. So, I mean she would get custody of the kids, but what good is she? He doesn\u2019t have anything documented down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Well. I, I think, you know, there might be a way of going about this without, you know, having to go to that step of you or him reporting anybody at that point. What, what I\u2019m thinking is that somebody medically should know what\u2019s going on with Laura.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">THERAPIST: And, and that it\u2019s a very serious situation that, you know, and the way, the way to kind of, I think angle this is that mom needs help and the kids need more. Mom needs help to take care of the kids and herself better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">THERAPIST: And, and, not in a, you know, not in a way that, you\u2019re not trying to attack anybody. You\u2019re just looking out for the best interest of the kids and mom is the key to that. And, if mom can\u2019t take care of the kids right, then, then you start thinking about well, who can help out? And, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200F71\">a long way from saying the kids are going in to somebody else\u2019s custody.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099713\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot of stuff that could go on before that.

His lunch to take to work. He even closed his office in Providence and moved his office so that he could <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D1\">be closer. So, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know.

If I do that, if the medication isn\u2019t working for you that you\u2019re on, I said why don\u2019t you try Botox, Laura? Oh. I never thought of that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201391\">I said yeah. I said I\u2019ve been getting the injections and it works fine. I haven\u2019t had a headache since.

I can\u2019t even remember what the hell it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">CLIENT: She called the police on me because I was taking the boys to the movies. She was in sleeping. I went in and told her. I said Laura, I\u2019m getting the boys ready to go to the movies. I brought the car seat. Put it in my car. I was just putting James in and Albert was already in the car and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201591\">was screaming out the door that I\u2019m kidnapping her kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Oh, boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to call the fucking police on you.

He has seen his older brother taken out of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D1\">house by the police. Hey. Auntie Louise\u2019s going by the police too. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yes. Well, as you\u2019re saying, it might not.

He decided we were going to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CD1\">sex. We no sooner got in to the bedroom and his phone rings. It\u2019s Keisha. I said you better answer it. So, she said when are you coming home, daddy? He says in a while. I\u2019m only right down the street. I\u2019ll be home in a while. Are you alright? Yeah. Is anything happening? No. He says okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CF\">Well, no sooner got ready to have the sex and the phone rings again.

He no sooner comes in the door of the house and my phone rings and it says <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CF2\">it\u2019s the hospital.

It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20259\">THERAPIST: And, it\u2019s important, though that you\u2019re noticing this. I think you\u2019re trying to, trying to, trying to work a way out that doesn\u2019t threaten them, but also gets your point across. It doesn\u2019t make you the one of the bad guys and alienate yourself from the family. But, you don\u2019t want, you also <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202591\">want to be helpful. You want them to get, you want them to get the help. You want them to be, the children to be protected and safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2025B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I definitely want that. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll try. They\u2019re all in Georgia now.

I said if, you know, if the children are too busy yacking away in there. You know? Put them in separate bedrooms. You have an extra bedroom. Yes, it\u2019s Ted\u2019s, but let Albert sleep in there so that when James is in his room in his bed, maybe he will go off to sleep by himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202A5\">If you poop him out enough during the day. Not shove him down in the cellar watching television, rather than outside in the back yard, but, then again, Laura you can\u2019t keep an eye on them out there either. That\u2019s how he sleeps.

She opened every single one out of like maybe fifteen that they had. They had bottles. They had pills things. I can\u2019t even twist them off. I said unreal. It took a, a three year old six seconds to get a cap off. So, can you imagine? You know?

And, I walk up there because I, I walk up there so Mark can take me shopping. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202DB1\">Or, he\u2019ll be at the house with the dog and the two of us will walk up and he runs in with the dog and I sit out in the car and away we go.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N202DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099713\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

And he, you know, I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t have it by now. But, no, it takes twenty one business days and then they, then you have to come in and see their <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2036F1\">doctor and he can evaluate you. But, they\u2019ll give you a ride there. I said good, but the day they give me the ride is the day I\u2019m going out in my walker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20371\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Don\u2019t be brave and try to use the cane.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20373\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t be brave and use the cane.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20375\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20377\">CLIENT: You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20379\">THERAPIST: Use the walker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2037B\">CLIENT: Bring the walker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2037D\">THERAPIST: Bring the walker.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2037C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2037C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099713\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2037F\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s really killing me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20381\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20383\">CLIENT: You know. Oh, well, I had a fight at the clinic with them. I told you how I was supposed to go to see Dr. Winchester and supposedly they had called and left me a message that he wasn\u2019t going to be in that day. Well, there was no message on my machine. Who they called, I don\u2019t know. So, I wound <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203831\">up seeing some other doctor and I told her an urinary tract infection and I needed more medication because the medication I was on had already run out. Well, how do you know you still have it? I said because I know. I know my body. Well, I want to talk about your constipation and your diabetes. I said <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203832\">talk all you want because I\u2019m not going to listen to it. So, I left there just and I said fuck it, I\u2019ll wait until Winchester comes back. Good bye and I walked out of there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20385\">She gave me a list for the labs. I went up to the labs and there was like five people ahead of me. I took that lab slip, rolled it up in a ball and threw it in the trash. The guy Jeremy\u2019s going Louise, did you take a ticket? I said ticket this, will you, Jeremy? Bye. I go on and then I missed my bus. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203851\">I was aggravated over that, so I took a taxi home. It cost me fifteen dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20387\">THERAPIST: Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20389\">CLIENT: And, I gave the guy a five dollar tip. And, I wouldn\u2019t mind, but he didn\u2019t even know where he was fucking going. I had to give him directions. Mark. Why didn\u2019t you call me? I said because I didn\u2019t know if you had the car or not. Well, you could have called and asked. I said just leave me alone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2038B\">THERAPIST: So, we\u2019re on for next week then?

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A1\">CLIENT: From the bus station and then to the train.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A3\">THERAPIST: Oh, good. Okay.

Okay. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AD\">CLIENT: I got my whole breakfast. I took two bites of scrambled eggs. A bite of a sausage and that was it. The rest is all in my bag because I was going to start to heave if I ate anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AF\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B1\">CLIENT: I just love this.

We\u2019ll see how that goes because I know he\u2019s not going to shape up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B9\">CLIENT: I told my brother, Jim, about you. I said you did what? Yeah. He came up to visit. He didn\u2019t bring his family up, so he says we went out. He says and I told him all about you and that I have been seeing you for three years. Three years. I go oh, Jesus Christ, Mark. Get a life.
