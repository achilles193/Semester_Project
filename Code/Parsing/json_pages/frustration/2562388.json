While I was here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: No, you weren\u2019t. That was two weeks ago. We didn\u2019t have anything last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been feeling a little shitty. You know, nausea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Like, physical issues?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s been driving me crazy for a long time. And, you know, the last couple weekends it\u2019s gotten bad. I haven\u2019t seen Lucille. I haven\u2019t been taking the kids over, barely. Finally, I had a follow-up appointment with my doctor and went and saw him yesterday. So, they tried to draw blood from <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">me and they couldn\u2019t. They got like, one vial. [58:50] So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter, but it\u2019s a pain in the ass. It makes it difficult to do work, \u2018cause I\u2019m nauseous. Of course, he gave me medication which I forgot. But otherwise, you know, I guess the usual stress. You know, it\u2019s like I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">I do have a lot to do. And I just feel this pressing need to do it all at once. You know, I\u2019ve got to get it done today. And I get so little of it done. Like, you know, that was \u2013 It\u2019s always an issue on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I planned to work Sunday, and I just didn\u2019t feel good. Didn\u2019t get any work done, you know. And I worked on Saturday. [2:03] So, you know, I just felt crappy yesterday. I was sick. I didn\u2019t take the kids. I did some work. It seems to keep coming in. I want to \u2013 on the separation agreement I wanted each <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">of us to get life insurance term policies. And that way, it would \u2013 we each would be the beneficiary on the other\u2019s policy. And if something happened to one of us, there would be money to replace whatever care, support that person provided. And, you know, for me to get a policy it wouldn\u2019t be too expensive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">A hundred bucks a month just for, you know. And I\u2019ve already got a policy. So I kind of agreed to keep Jess as the beneficiary of that policy until Lucille\u2019s emancipated. But I asked, you know, my guy, what would term be like on her if she took a physical. He said, really cheap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So I said, you know, I\u2019m worried you policy is going to lapse. You know, it\u2019s like two hundred and some bucks a month. She ain\u2019t paying it. And if something happens to you, you know, I\u2019m screwed. So it\u2019s a much, much cheaper option to get this term policy. And her response was, well why don\u2019t you keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">my policy up-to-date, you know. It\u2019s a huge loan. [4:10] There\u2019s, lord knows, it\u2019s an expensive policy, you know. I don\u2019t need \u2013 it\u2019s an investment for her. Me putting money in there for her to draw on if she wanted, you know. Fuck that. She\u2019s refused to commit to any type of 529 or, you know. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">in the agreement, but there\u2019s no real bite to it. You know. I think at least for me, I can go back, if she starts making good money, which would never happen. But let\u2019s say that happens. I could go back and try to get a modification and say listen, you know. We wanted to get life insurance. We wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">to get 529 plans. She can\u2019t afford to do it now. [5:03] I don\u2019t care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">I mean, business is starting to hum along for me. I don\u2019t know what to do about this direct mail thing. It\u2019s been about three months, and not a single call. I\u2019m spending about a third of that on the paid search. And I don\u2019t know have time to do my work, because I\u2019m too busy talking to new clients. I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">got to work it out. I\u2019ve just got to, you know, like tonight I\u2019ve got tickets to the Red Sox game. And Marcia doesn\u2019t want to go, because it\u2019s going to be cold. [6:01] You know, I\u2019m like \u2013 I need to do work. Just \u2018cause tomorrow I\u2019m going to be in housing court. I don\u2019t know what I have tomorrow night. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">But Thursday is La Tip (ph). And, you know, I\u2019d like to go down and see Marcia.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562388\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">Today I\u2019ve got to drive up to fucking Acton, because the Amesbury County Registry of Deeds in Massachusetts, you\u2019ve got to pay $4.00 just to view a page online if you don\u2019t have an account. If you have an account, it\u2019s $2.00 just to view it. And when you do a title examination, you view every single <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">document. So we\u2019re talking going back 35 years. And in Massachusetts, they don\u2019t like paying their property taxes. So everybody has property tax liens every fucking year. [7:00] They redeem them when the town threatens to sell it or whatever. So it\u2019s a pain in the ass, \u2018cause you\u2019ve got to look at each <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">one, and make sure that they\u2019ve all been paid up and match up. And, I\u2019m thinking to myself, I should have counted, but I\u2019m like, you know. And we\u2019re talking $4.00 a page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: And how many pages are there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Well, a mortgage is 15. Or maybe it\u2019s $4.00 a document. I don\u2019t know. Anyways, I did the abstract based on just the written information with the pages, dates and all that. I\u2019m just going to go up there and take a look at everything for free on their computer and print out what I need. And, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">know, it\u2019s \u2013 the new attorney, the one that was kind of using me when his guy went on vacation, and now his guy\u2019s not doing Manchester and never did Barnstable. So I did this Barnstable. But not doing Southern Massachusetts anymore. [8:01] And, you know, Amesbury is one of those counties that, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">it\u2019s like I hate to send them to another examiner. Because that other examiner is going to do Southern Massachusetts. When they wanted me to go to fucking Ossipee. Sorry. I\u2019ve got a lady up there you can talk to. But, you know, Amesbury, somebody who does Amesbury\u2019s probably going to do the southern <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">\u2013 Massachusetts. So I feel like I\u2019ve got to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Right. Or justify the fact that you might not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the cost of doing business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Protecting Southern Massachusetts, you have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: You know, I don\u2019t want to give them a reason. And it\u2019s not like they send me a ton of it. And if they do \u2013 if I do start getting a ton of it, but I won\u2019t. But if I do \u2013 because the guy in Le Tip does Massachusetts. I\u2019ll just get an account online, which I think you can view for free if you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">an account. 8:58} You know, it kind of cuts into my day. But I\u2019m going to stop and see my acupuncturist, which, I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s got big boobs. She\u2019s kind of nerdy pretty. I was telling her about my nausea. She\u2019s rubbing my arm. And this is a meeting. Kind of felt a little awkward. Not awkward. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">have a mini \u2013 I\u2019m attracted to this woman. And things are going great with Marcia. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this way. We seem to have come to a little better understanding about just communicating and understanding when \u2013 so we don\u2019t seem to be getting into arguments or anything like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562388\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">Last week was vacation week. And a friend of hers who\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t believe she has a job, but she was on disability for a while. But she\u2019s a schoolteacher. She\u2019s an alcoholic. [10:34] So it\u2019s vacation week and she goes out to lunch with Marcia. When I got to Marcia\u2019s house, she was already pretty buzzed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">And I had just had a rough day, and I was just stressed out or whatever. You know, I was just \u2013 but she just kind of didn\u2019t make a big deal of it. After I kind of calmed down a little bit, you know, we were able to kind of laugh about it or whatever. So it\u2019s going well. I had tickets to a concert on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">Friday. Once again, I didn\u2019t feel that well. It was Aimee Mann and Ted Leo. I really \u2013 they\u2019re playing in a band called The Both. They had toured together and started writing music together. And I really wanted to go, but I couldn\u2019t find anybody to go with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">Marcia was going to go, but her truck \u2013 I mean, it sounds horrible. Her tires are bald. [11:37] And so I\u2019m like, you\u2019re either borrowing a car, or you\u2019re not coming. \u2018Cause I couldn\u2019t drive down there. I had closings. All kinds of whatever. So I decided, I just don\u2019t feel good. I\u2019m not going to go to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">the show, and I drove down there. I\u2019d rather go hang out with her, than go to a show by myself. I did that before early on in the relationship with Black Francis, the guy from The Pixies, which was another show I really wanted to see. But I got to a lot of music. I was able to sell the Black Francis, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">but not The Both. [12:26] I piss money out the door. It\u2019s just your money. You\u2019re moving up the list. Moving up the list. I\u2019m almost about to send a check to the Harvard Faculty shitheads. Whatever. I think I\u2019m going to send a picture of like a poop or something in the toilet. Something really juvenile. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200313\">So I need help at work. I\u2019m not busy. And one of the things that is taking up time is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Wait. I\u2019m sorry. You just said that \u2013 so I need help at work, I\u2019m not busy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: I am busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: And one of the areas \u2013 you know, \u2018cause Marcia was a real estate paralegal. She\u2019s like, can I help you, can I help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t know she was a real estate paralegal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. She was laid off. That\u2019s how she got into the dog-walking gig. And, you know, I do so much myself as part of my practice, that I really \u2013 I don\u2019t even know how or where to begin to get her involved. [14:01] It\u2019s not like I\u2019m constantly getting a flow of closings. A lot of it\u2019s me meeting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">with people. But the one area that she could help me out is with title examinations. And I could start her out with \u2013 you know, the first thing you do is the chain of title. You know, who are the owners over the last 50 years. And for most registries, she can do that on her computer. And that saves <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">me a lot of time. It\u2019s already written out, deed from so-and-so to so-and-so. Boom and then boom, I just go to the index and abstract the rest. And, you know, that could save me 15, 20, 30 minutes on a title, depending on what it is, you know. And it is like, the first step in kind of teaching her about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D3\">\u2013 to basically do full title examinations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">So I told her, I said, you know \u2013 first of all, she was talking about getting used tires. I said, you\u2019re not getting used tires. I said, you\u2019re getting new tires. [15:15] And I\u2019ll pay for them and you\u2019ll work it off. So I already took her on a Staples copy run on Friday. I said, I hope you\u2019re keeping <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">track of your time. I have no idea what to pay her, you know. And of course, it\u2019s going to be under the table. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t, you know, give her money anyways. I think she feels better if she\u2019s earning it. I think it bothers her, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562388\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">So for her birthday, I\u2019m taking her to see Phil Lesh in Central Park in New York. John Scofield, my favorite all-time jazz guitar player. He played with Miles Davis. I\u2019ve seen him a couple of times. [16:13] I think he went to Berklee and then teaches on and off at Berklee. John Modeski, who recorded <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">an album with his band with John Scofield. Modeski\u2019s got kind of a funky jazz band. He plays organ. And he\u2019s done a lot of stuff like movies, like the sound to movies and whatnot. Remember Get Shorty? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the kind of stuff you like. And then, Warren Haynes, you know. He\u2019s the guy I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">went and saw at Tanglewood. He\u2019s going to be playing with the Pops. And there\u2019s one more. It\u2019s just like an all-star lineup. I\u2019ve never seen a show with Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead is probably the least of all of the people playing that I want to see, you know. [17:09] But that will be fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">I screwed up this Friday. I was so busy, I missed the on-sale. So I ended up having to buy them on Stub Hub at like, twice the price. But once again, that\u2019s just your money. I don\u2019 know what to do about Frisbee. I just \u2013 and hopefully this nausea thing can I just don\u2019t even feel like starting to exercise. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">You know, I\u2019m losing weight, you know, because I\u2019m eating a little better. I think that\u2019s helping. I\u2019m taking stairs and it\u2019s getting a little easier and whatever. But I need to really start seriously working out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Do you know why you\u2019re feeling like shit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: No. And Dr. Troutman (ph) is perplexed. He\u2019s going to run a sediment test for Chron\u2019s. He says there\u2019s a bacteria that lives in your stomach, and only in your stomach. [18:14] And he wants to rule that out, so he\u2019s going to test for that. You need to take four different antibiotics at once for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">that bacteria. What else is he looking at? I don\u2019 know. I probably have cancer or something like that. It\u2019s a real pain in the ass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like it. It\u2019s keeping you from working. It\u2019s keeping you from exercising. Keeping you from seeing your kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: The kids has been \u2013 I\u2019ve seen Ian pretty regularly and I see Stella at practice or whatever for a little bit of the time. (pause) [19:28] I think to some degree I\u2019m just, by the time like, Sunday comes around, just exhausted. I\u2019m just slept all day from exhaustion. I woke up and I took Ian home <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">at 9:30. You know, he was like, trying to wake me up all morning. I finally got up around quarter to nine. I took him home. Came back home. Fell asleep and woke up at like, 2:00. And then ended up falling asleep around 9:00. You know, two weekends ago, I was puking my guts out Sunday for no apparent <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">reason. You know, I wasn\u2019t hung over or, you know.

You seem not as stressed certainly, and things appear to be going well with Marcia. And working in a committee which was stressful in a way, but in another way, I think it was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562388\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">CLIENT: And I do think it\u2019s getting worse. But Dr. Billings did suggest acupuncture. And I\u2019ve just been so busy and so \u2013 Everything\u2019s just spinning around in my head that I can\u2019t even do things like make appointments. I just forget about \u2013 I just, you know. [21:06] I don\u2019t want to say my focus is off. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve got too many things to focus on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: We were talking a little bit about you and organization, I think, two or three weeks ago. Are you figuring out a way to get more organized?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: I do. And even Dr. Lynn, (sp) she says, oh, I\u2019ll help you organize. Thanks, but it\u2019s a little awkward I guess. I\u2019ve kind of \u2013 something I\u2019m starting to do is schedule \u2013 Like, I put in my schedule that I\u2019m going to Acton today. And starting to put in times that I feel I need to be working on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">things. But it\u2019s still just \u2013 I\u2019ve been having a horrible time with technology. I can\u2019t get Google to communicate with my Outlook. My Google Voice, people will call one of my numbers which will forward to my office phone, which will forward to my cell phone. But my Google Voice is the voice-mail. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200532\">even though you didn\u2019t call that number, you\u2019ll get a message that says, the number you are trying to reach, 555-555-5555, is not in service. [22:31] So people are like, well, first of all, I didn\u2019t call that number, and why is it out of service. So they call one of my other numbers. The same thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200533\">happens. I\u2019ve got all these numbers. So that\u2019s been kind of a pain. And I think I\u2019ve kind of \u2013 I just stopped the Google number from forwarding to my cell phone. And I think that might, you know, have helped solve it, but it\u2019s frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">THERAPIST: It sounds like what you need are some ways of being organized and like, dealing with the input of messages and information that you get the organization of all that stuff, so you know what you have on your to-do list. And then, some kind of planning around when you\u2019re going to get it done, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">so that you take the load off of your brain. [23:23] You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">CLIENT: But here\u2019s the perfect example. Well, because of this whole voice-mail thing, and also I feel, you know, this could be a potential client calling, I take a phone call as I\u2019m trying to get some work done and leave to go see Marcia. And it was no big deal if I didn\u2019t get the work done. It wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">the end of the world, you know. But, you know, this woman called about this landlord \u2013 I didn\u2019t know if I was representing them or not. And the old property manager was fired, and this was the old new property manager. So I ended up being on the phone for 20 minutes with this woman, because the hearing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200572\">is Wednesday, and they had no idea the hearing\u2019s Wednesday. So they\u2019ve got to get my $2,000 before Wednesday and sign my engagement letter. So that was something that, you know, yeah she probably would have left a voice-mail, but I would have still had to deal with it that night. And it would have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200573\">in the car or at Marcia\u2019s, you know. But anyway, it\u2019s those kind of interruptions where I feel it\u2019s important that I talk to this woman, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">THERAPIST: Right. And those are going to happen. I guess, the question is, how do you roll with them as they come in.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562388\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve got to limit my time on the road, too. Like today, I keep feeling for reason that I need to go into Pembroke, but I\u2019m not going to. I feel like I brought everything that I need, and, you know. That\u2019s a waste of time that I could be working or resting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Maybe you need a few hours with somebody to work on this. Like workflow organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019ve got to get my office done first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">THERAPIST: Kind of assistance. Yeah, but you\u2019re getting busy enough now to where it sounds like there are some inefficiencies that are probably costing you some money from all this. [25:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: Well, the cabinets are heavy on the list. That\u2019s not really a debt, though. That\u2019s an investment. But I can\u2019t get my office \u2013 I don\u2019t want to push everything back up against the walls or organize them out. But once I have cabinets, I can start putting things away and, you know, organize and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">clean up my space and, you know, it\u2019 just getting worse and worse in there, you know. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s adding to my disorganization. It\u2019s how I approach doing the work, and how I organize, you know. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m trying to put \u2013 these are the files I need to work on today and they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200632\">in the front of my carrying case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: I used to do this kind of stuff with people when I was in graduate school and then for a few years after with people with ADHD. And a lot of my students, high school, college and grad students, but also just some working folks. So I\u2019m not saying you\u2019d do it with me necessarily, but yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">I mean, it makes a difference to have software and systems in place to deal with that kind of stuff, because it frees your head up to actually remember things and think. [26:31] And often, it\u2019s very helpful to talk to someone about it, because, you know it\u2019s that sort of stuff that you do implicitly <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">and on the fly that you don\u2019t sort of, step back and actually take in the whole picture and think about. That can help<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just the people I\u2019ve talked to who have done that, I think it\u2019s just \u2018cause it\u2019s like therapists. Anybody thinks that they can be a therapist. Well, anybody thinks that they can be a personal organizer. And it\u2019s very huge in these networking seminars. And every person I\u2019ve talked to who <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">have used one of these people are just like, yeah, it was a little helpful, but they basically told you obvious stuff. [27:24] And it doesn\u2019t sound like any of these people would come in and, you know, make systems specific to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: Well, I think that\u2019s where the action is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: And I think it\u2019s incumbent upon me. And I really just need to kind of put the kids and Marcia on the back burner for a little bit and get myself a chance to get organized. I think part of it is I don\u2019t even have a chance to get organized. This morning, I was trying to catch up on stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I think the thing is like, if you get somebody in, I agree it\u2019s pretty much a waste of time for somebody to just sit and talk at you about this. What they\u2019d need to do was spend I don\u2019t know, five or six, seven, eight hours\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: That sounds expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: \u2026the first half of which is just like, some combination of watching you and talking to you about how you work and what you have to do and what the tasks are. Like, getting the lay of the land, so that they can then, you know, think with you after that. [28:39] And it\u2019s not so much like they <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">have magic words. They might know some software or things like that that you don\u2019t know about. But mostly what it is, is just stepping back and thinking about it with somebody who can kind of facilitate that. You know, and who actually is willing to roll up their sleeves and get into what you actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200712\">have to do, rather than just saying, oh, well, your should make to-lists and you should also prioritize and I\u2019ll see you later. But no, I hear you. It would cost some money. I guess \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not at all clear to me how much you\u2019re losing from not being more on top of this stuff. But I do know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200713\">that particularly, you know, like, in ADHD, it can be a big deal. [29:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562388\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: I\u2019m losing some goodwill as people are like, he was just another attorney who\u2019s dragging things out. You know, doesn\u2019t respond to phone calls. Doesn\u2019t respond to e-mails. And there\u2019s the psychic capital. What is this doing in my mind? And in a day like yesterday, it\u2019s just very easy. First of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200731\">all, it\u2019s just like, you know, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m using my gut as an excuse. Jess, I\u2019ll pick the kids up, \u2018cause it\u2019s like, 1:00. But could you come pick them up early for me, you know. She\u2019s like oh, I\u2019m leaving Barnstable now and I can pick them up, you know. They\u2019re all yours. And I go and I realize <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200732\">I haven\u2019t picked up my Red Sox tickets, so I went and I\u2019m like oh, Ezra works right by the registry. I go, I\u2019ve got to order a file. I\u2019ve got to run some probates. I go do that. I get the tickets. Get home. [30:38] Where\u2019s my briefcase. Left it at the clerk\u2019s office at the probate court. I go back to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200733\">the court. You\u2019d be surprised. It was in the same exact spot that I left it, right out in front and where everybody walks in. And when I went downstairs, you know, the security guard goes, where was it? I go, exactly where I left it. She said, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. It\u2019s like, there are people <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200734\">who get pretty crazy in there about that stuff. But, you know, there\u2019s me getting in the way of myself. And I\u2019m doing those kind of things all the time. And, you know, that\u2019s a valuable half hour I lost, maybe more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. IF you had the advantage of putting systems like organizational systems and processes in place, is that it takes a load off your mind, so that you can be focused on other things. [31:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">CLIENT: Like with my computer. I waste so much time dealing with all kinds of technical problems. I think I was hacked the other day, \u2018cause there\u2019s all these folders I never use all of a sudden were modified on April 23rd, 2014. And since then, that\u2019s when I\u2019ve been having trouble between getting with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200771\">Google. And I think the Google voice-mail thing maybe suffered, I don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s no one to call at Google. So there\u2019s all these technology things that keep \u2013 I\u2019m booting up my computer and the mouse thing. I\u2019ve got to reboot it. Booting up my computer, the screen doesn\u2019t come on. I\u2019ve got to reboot it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">And it\u2019s like yeah, you know, I can get a new computer and pay Dell a few dollars a month and, you know, I don\u2019t want to rush into that. And I feel like, to some degree, where do I suck it up to make some money for a little while, and where do I spend the money. And that\u2019s the hard part, too. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">I feel like spending money on technology right now is the wrong thing to do, because I don\u2019t know what my needs are, really. And do I want to have just like, a server at home. Actually, I\u2019d rather have it at the office. It\u2019s a better AT&amp;T One connection. And then just have like, a tablet. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200792\">I\u2019ve never used a tablet. It seems kind of awkward to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562388\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">Or just a mini laptop or, you know, switch over to the closing software that\u2019s in the Cloud where you just go to a Web site. It\u2019s a little more expensive. But I think it\u2019s less time and would be amenable to this type of system. But I don\u2019t want to just treat lightly, you know. [33:49] I want a good <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B1\">server that\u2019s secure. I\u2019m just not ready \u2013 I want to spend money on cabinets. I feel that\u2019s more important in getting organized. Getting my office. I think that\u2019s a big psychological \u2013 And the cabinets are cheap. I mean, not cheap, but I can put them on a credit card. (pause) April, this is the best <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B2\">month I\u2019ve had in God knows. Maybe ever, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">And Dr. Billings said that the Lisinopril (ph) gives you one of those argh things. So that\u2019s another medication I\u2019m switching. Which, I didn\u2019t realize. I thought it was just the head rushes from the car accident, but it can also contribute to the coughing as well. I\u2019m a wreck. But I woke up today happy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D1\">feeling good. I spent all this wasted time in the car. [35:12] I think the idea that I\u2019m not \u2013 that there\u2019s no pressure to do anything tonight. Tomorrow night I\u2019m going to go out with my buddy, Gerald. He\u2019s been sending me a lot of business. And he\u2019ll probably give me some money for business I\u2019ve sent <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D2\">him or business I\u2019ve done for him. (pause) And the phone\u2019s been quiet. E-mail \u2013 I mean, I\u2019ve got my phone on do not disturb right now. I should probably take it off. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I notice the phone is pretty well coordinated with your socks there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: You like that? Pretty cool. [36:11] Well, at least I know they\u2019re working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great you\u2019ve had such a great month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. And May\u2019s going to be a good month, too. I\u2019ve already -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There\u2019s no reason to think it won\u2019t continue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve just got a re-fi. I sent the deal to the mortgage guy in the group, and a loan officer from his company checked out my LinkedIn page, and then yesterday and like, two days later, I got a title order. So it could be his, but it might be this other law office, but I don\u2019t know. In Le Tip <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">(ph) you do visitations where they draw cards and you go and you visit someone at their office. So I\u2019ll go to his office and meet all the loan officers and get to schmooze and work my way in there. [37:08] But things I was behind on, I mean, I\u2019m like caught up on my \u2013 I\u2019ve already paid May\u2019s rent. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200892\">caught up on health insurance. And that\u2019s with me having to pay all the fucking taxes and Jess still owes me for all kinds of shit that I\u2019m never going to see. She\u2019s a welfare mom. She has a friend who games the system, and I think she just talks to that woman too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Do you know why she\u2019s not working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: To take care of the kids. I think Stella spends all Friday with her. You know, I just don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019m not going to fight it. You know, it\u2019s like I always say, you know, I\u2019m going to live my life with no expectation of any sort of inheritance. I have no expectation of her providing anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D1\">for anybody, so I\u2019m prepared. Like the after school Catcher (ph) and the Jewish program. Oh, it\u2019s so much more expensive than arts and crafts. I said yeah, but I\u2019ll pay for it. It\u2019s expensive. I\u2019ll pay for it. [38:55] She\u2019s a pain in the ass on everything. The answer to everything is no.

I\u2019m getting better at dealing with not being able to bang stuff to people right away. [39:48] That\u2019s what other people are used to with other attorneys. I think the key is to try and \u2013 I\u2019ve got to do better communication with clients. And that\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F1\">thing that falls off. It\u2019s like, okay, I\u2019ve got to remember to e-mail this guy to tell his dad that I haven\u2019t been able to call him. And just remembering to do those little things. And I try and make lists. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll figure it out, I guess, if I don\u2019t die of cancer first. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F2\">be too bothered by that.

I\u2019m just getting a little more, well, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it kind of \u2013 I can\u2019t kill myself. I find ways to justify it. [41:44] But I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200931\">really got to just \u2013 Like, I was going to take this weekend. Then I get a fucking message from Jess. Spring cleaning at Agassi (ph) from noon to three. Well, there\u2019s soccer, there\u2019s that and, you know. There\u2019s no day that\u2019s just laid out for me to just do work. It doesn\u2019t exist. (pause) But I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200932\">it\u2019s better than the old way. [42:34] Stressed about not having work.
