But I don\u2019t know (chuckling). I feel (pause) there\u2019s so much uncertainty. I guess I have to live with it. But I think certainty kind of scares me, bores me, so it\u2019s\u2026 uncertainty scares me, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">certainty bores me. So I\u2019m not really sure which emotion is better, [which one I can live with more] (ph) (chuckling). I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. (Pause) [0:06:58] Yeah, what is it about certainty that\u2026? Well, I guess it also scares me. What could it be about certainty that makes me so afraid? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">I\u2019m not sure. (Pause) Do you know (chuckling)? What usually scares people about certainties? I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t understand your questions, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m pausing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Well, with David, he was saying, so my life for the next seven, six, seven years is going to be teaching and producing six or seven papers. [0:08:04] I was like, really? I mean, so\u2026 and I was surprised that it he had it down to that specificity. And he said, no, that really is it. And he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">telling me it takes so much amount of time to work on a paper, and then send it out, and then they send it back, and this and that. So\u2026 but, I mean, there was\u2026 I tried to detect kind of a resignation in his voice. Maybe there was some, but it was more\u2026 there was more comfort in his voice than resignation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">He knew this was what was going to happen, and he was prepared for it or preparing for it. He knew. It was almost like he could see his future and go forward and live it. [0:09:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And that frightened me a little bit. I mean, I wonder if I wanted certainty of that kind in my life, and I don\u2019t know if I do or\u2026 I mean, it would be good to know that I\u2019m getting published somewhere or finishing a book or\u2026 and sending it out and that it would be accepted. That would be awesome to know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">(chuckling). But I want\u2026 I think I want\u2026 I like the idea of having things open and not knowing and (pause) there being a lot more kind of variation (chuckling)? I don\u2019t know. [0:09:56] I find it hard to describe the actual\u2026 he keeps saying, it\u2019s so nice to have you here. (Chuckling) And I keep feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">bad about that. Yesterday, he was like, let\u2019s get engaged. And I was like, no (chuckling). I just feel horrible for that, and... (Pause) Just\u2026 I\u2019m surprised I guess. I\u2019m like, don\u2019t you want to know more people? Or don\u2019t you\u2026? How can you forgive me for what I did, and all that? And I guess I shouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B3\">look a gift horse in the mouth. But still even\u2026 then for his sake what does it mean? [0:10:56] I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making any sense (chuckling). But\u2026 (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559380\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">I think I used to like or still like the idea of potentiality. Like, what is a person\u2019s potential or an idea\u2019s potential? And I was very afraid to explore those ideas. But now that it\u2019s time to explore them... for the longest time I just thought if\u2026 I had to feel that I lived in just thinking. You know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">Yeah, that I have this idea, I have these ideas, and I write them down somewhere. But I have a job right now, so I cannot really find out what those ideas would look like if I carry them through. [0:11:59] Now I have the (inaudible at 0:12:02) kind of carry them through, and very (ph) disappointing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">when you actually say you have an idea for a story, and then you execute it. And you\u2019re like, huh, it wasn\u2019t as interesting as I thought it would be. (Pause) You can\u2019t really live your whole life just in the potentiality of stuff. You have to execute those ideas, too. And that is what they look like. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">They could be disappointing, but you have to, I don\u2019t know, make your peace with them? I\u2019m not sure (chuckling). (Pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know. [0:12:59] I guess I do that quite often. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">For the longest time that I\u2019ve known Victor, he\u2026 the\u2026 what I liked about him was that\u2026 I would always introduce him to other people as, oh, he\u2019s this great filmmaker (chuckling), even though he hasn\u2019t made [a lot] (ph). But I had the idea, belief, that if he did get a chance to make a film, it would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">be awesome, it would be great, just because he\u2019s seen everything great that\u2019s been made. But I was talking to my roommate last night, and that\u2019s what she was saying. It\u2019s very dangerous to love people based on their potential. [0:14:03] You have to live in reality. What have they really achieved? Who <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">are they right now? But then I feel like, in that case, David should not like me at all, because, who am I right now? I\u2019m not anyone. I have this potential, and people recognize me for that potential right now, people who\u2019ve heard my stories or my teachers. They recognize the potential, but I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">I have the time right now to turn that potential into (inaudible at 0:14:42) or something (chuckling) and see where that takes me. Am I making any sense (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve asked that a few times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure if I am. [0:14:56] I\u2019m just saying, why would David want\u2026 ? I mean, isn\u2019t he doing the same thing? I mean, he\u2019s supposed to be the realistic one here. (Pause) (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: How is he not being realistic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: How is he not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, for wanting to be with me, for liking me for my potential and not for who I am right now. But that\u2019s just who I am. I haven\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m on\u2026 trying to get somewhere. I\u2019m not there yet. And that\u2019s my (inaudible at 0:15:37), or that\u2019s just what I\u2019m doing right now. (Chuckling) Right now <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">has been a few years, since 2009. But\u2026yeah, [when I had jobs] (ph) (inaudible at 0:15:53). (Sighing) I don\u2019t know (chuckling). [0:15:57] I guess I started talking about certainty versus uncertainty and then somehow connected to potentiality [at some point] (ph). Yeah, I mean, the uncertainty in potentiality, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">that is attractive, I guess. Maybe that\u2019s attractive to David as well, maybe. (Pause) But can you help me understand some of this confusion in my head around being scared of certainty?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559380\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Sure, I can.

I don\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Like a philosophy of life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: No, not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019m not sure what you want from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: No, like previously when you articulated some stuff to me that\u2019s been very helpful, so I just wonder if you could do that here (chuckling). But I\u2019m not sure how you do what you do. I don\u2019t know how you do it, so (inaudible at 0:17:36). (Pause) [0:18:00] Yeah, I\u2019m just not sure what it is about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">David\u2019s certainty that scares me. [That\u2019s all] (ph). I wonder if you could help me explore it (chuckling). That\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well, and I guess\u2026 yeah. My answer is yes. So is then the expectation that you ask you a question\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Because I\u2019m not sure, after that\u2026 yes, I very much feel I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: But then I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking for after that.

(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I\u2019m not\u2026 you\u2019ve been in here having your experience.

Yeah (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: So then what\u2019s the\u2026? So I guess I\u2019m trying to understand what the question is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: What question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re saying, how does it\u2026? [0:19:54] Even your saying, how does it work in here, when you\u2019ve been in here for a while, so I feel there must be something else you\u2019re looking for, not just how it works, because we\u2019ve been working together.
