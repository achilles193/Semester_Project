So the time works. What was going on? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Well I thought you had asked whether I wanted to move to Thursdays at 4:15 so I was mistaken I guess and I was thinking about a slightly long term thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: No. I mean we can talk about it. I know that 4:15 isn\u2019t \u2013 if I said it, I misspoke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Is there a different \u2013 what are you thinking in terms of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m not thinking of anything right now. This is fine for the time being. But, I mean today \u2013 this goes into my session, but I was \u2013 had a choice of going to a car company or coming here. If I went to the car company I would be guaranteed work at some point selling products. But it wouldn\u2019t be immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Why? Was there an interview or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it\u2019s been \u2013 there\u2019s this guy who places people at car companys and trains them. And then they pay him some amount to get them a decent salesperson who they then train their own way or whatever. So I\u2019ve been going to his class in Dupont Circle for this week. My (unclear) for tryout <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">at Dupont Circle was yesterday and it didn\u2019t go very well. When I met the guy on Monday of this week he\u2019d said, \u2018come in for class Wednesday and it became clear the class was three days long and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: How did that sound to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well it didn\u2019t sound like a sure thing. Well, he made it sound like a sure thing so I didn\u2019t think it was a sure thing. But at the time \u2013 I guess I was (unclear) because they said it was like a $50,000 minimum the first year. So, it would be enough money to help me solve my problems financially <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">and maybe pay for classes somewhere before too long. So he basically assured me nobody falls through the cracks. You know, I want to (unclear) everyone. So I said okay, this is kind of a big time commitment for me because I have something every evening of the week from 5:30 to 8:30. I mean if I come <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">here I\u2019m not going to be working and I just said it\u2019s a big commitment for me. So I said, \u2018don\u2019t let me down.\u2019 He said, \u2018I won\u2019t let you down.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Did it conflict with your schedule, your work schedule?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, I left my work on Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: You did, huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just left. (Unclear) But then when I got there Thursday for the interview I\u2019d gone through two days of training in his class. It\u2019s really simple but really was good. I mean I respect sort of, or I \u2013 envy is the better word, or covet sales people\u2019s ability to manage social interactions <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">in an organized way that benefits them because that\u2019s something I absolutely can\u2019t do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: The persuasiveness, that kind of thing. They\u2019re able to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: No. For me it\u2019s not the persuasiveness, it\u2019s the \u2013 persuasiveness, I don\u2019t like the word because that implies talking to someone and reasoning with them. Because the way sales people work, or good sales people, they don\u2019t set it up to deal with reason pretty much at all. They deal with or cultivate <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">familiarity with people and you phrase things in such a way that leads them to a certain conclusion and makes them want to be wherever they are (unclear) with that. [0:04:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I don\u2019t completely understand it but what I respect is the ability to organize the social process in a beneficial way. It\u2019s not anything about having a good way of speaking or something like that. Unless their way of speaking just means just being friendly to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561956\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">(Pause): [0:05:13 [0:05:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, (unclear) some of it was kind of beneath my intelligence. I can tell when he\u2019s kind of bending the truth a little bit at least some of the time, although I couldn\u2019t tell all of the time but he seemed like a very good salesman \u2013 someone who uses body language and intonation and rhetoric <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">to motivate people to do something that they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do or want to do. So here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s not selling products anymore, but he talks about the value of selling products so they can train people to sell products so they can sell those people to companys and he sells the companys <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">on himself and also uses the students to publicize himself and his training program so he had all his students mystery-shop companys. Then if the companys call them back they were to just say that he sent them there, things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">But anyway when I got to the interview, the way the interview opened is, \u2018you\u2019re not [so-and-so].\u2019 And so they didn\u2019t even have either of the two resumes I\u2019d given to them, or either of the two applications so I was kind of upset because I think he sort of psyched me in because I was too far away. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">didn\u2019t know I was too far away, that I had a commitment in the evening, I think, to start. So he assumed that to protect his reputation of providing them with quality applicants, he wasn\u2019t going to support me (unclear) work for them. [0:07:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Because he didn\u2019t see your resume yet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: The two managers that were responsible for the company hadn\u2019t seen my resume. The guy who was teaching the class had seen my resume. He had taken another resume that I had filled out to the company directly and taken it and said, here, give it to the company on Friday. But the only important <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">thing emotionally was that I had invested a lot in the training, you know, kind of convincing myself that this is something I want to do. Doing a lot of work not having \u2013 I haven\u2019t really slept \u2013 I slept last night, but two nights before that I didn\u2019t really sleep because I was doing work when I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">have slept. That\u2019s one of the things that the teacher provides you with that he motivates you. You\u2019re motivated. I wouldn\u2019t ordinarily dress up in a suit during the days, but I was looking very nice the last three days. I was, well, I was positive. I wasn\u2019t sleeping much but I was positive and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200373\">trust myself. I thought about going to the classes and I didn\u2019t trust the guy, but I thought about how I\u2019d used the time otherwise, that it would just be unstructured or I\u2019d be masturbating or I \u2013 like I didn\u2019t trust myself to use the time well so it was just as well that I was going to the class. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200374\">I felt kind of betrayed by the guy. I\u2019m not sure I was betrayed but I was hurt that I hadn\u2019t \u2013 that I\u2019d sacrificed so much and it could be so easily dispensed with. I hadn\u2019t slept the past two days. I\u2019d sacrificed things that were actually important to me to do something that was important for my financial <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200375\">survival but less important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: That someone else said, well, this guy\u2019s not going to be good here, so \u2013 torpedo.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561956\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: The company guy, yeah. I\u2019m not sure I understand how the \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: The guy I\u2019m talking about, he trains people for the companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Did the company refer you to him or did you find him on your own?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, he worked in the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: So as I understand it, here\u2019s how it works. (unclear) says that our sales staff isn\u2019t motivated. They suck. So we\u2019re going to have some guy come in and give us better sales people. So maybe they fire some of the people or they wait until he finds some better people. But he comes in and he agDonaldates <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">some group of trainees. He has the company place an ad in the paper saying, \u2018here\u2019s what you can expect. Come, we\u2019re interviewing these days. So they pay for the ads. He works and trains the people, and he gets commission based on how many people they accept as employees. So the whole thing goes back, for instance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: So $850 commission per person. That\u2019s what he said. And another $900 or so if the sell X-number of products in the first year or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And so you just met with this guy \u2013 the trainer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: And then you went and he trained you for a couple of days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Actually, I showed up early for my appointment. So I just filled out an application for the company before I met the training guy. I handed the application to him. He said, \u2018oh, I\u2019ll take that.\u2019 And he said, \u2018fill out this application, too.\u2019 So I filled out two applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: One for the company and one for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. And most people probably filled out one application for him. But I mean, the guy\u2019s telling me that he\u2019s supporting me to work in a place, but really he runs like multiple chains for different companies around. And so I\u2019m not sure why he wanted to keep me there so much. He didn\u2019t really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">but he wasn\u2019t just going to tell me outright \u2013 I\u2019m not being very clear \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t going to tell me outright that they\u2019re not going to hire you because you\u2019re too far away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Oh, so they didn\u2019t want to hire you because you lived too far from the company?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well, you know \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t and he wouldn\u2019t want me to be presented to them because I\u2019m not a quality applicant based on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Based on that. I\u2019ve got it. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: So I didn\u2019t really have the chance to argue the point though because I was never like \u2013 (unclear) with them. They didn\u2019t have my application. They didn\u2019t have my resume. They didn\u2019t know who I was. That\u2019s like having some guy off the street come in where he would have said, \u2018here\u2019s this guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">here, here\u2019s his resume, here\u2019s his application. Here\u2019s his name. Here\u2019s how he\u2019s done in class.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Yeah. And you ended up taking the whole class?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: No. The end of the class was today. But I knew yesterday that I wouldn\u2019t work out there. So I just went there to talk to the guy and say, you promised me this and you didn\u2019t really deliver.\u2019 But the thing I couldn\u2019t do is go through a set of questions that I\u2019d set up. Like I\u2019d set up pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">logical questions. One of which was \u2013 doesn\u2019t something in the sales information you\u2019ve been teaching suggest that you could have treated me a little better? Something like that. Or \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ve given you two applications and two resumes and 20 hours of my time and you didn\u2019t get me the interview that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">promised. I said that much but his excuse was \u2013 he turned it around and said, you were late this day so I crossed off your name. (Unclear). [0:13:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561956\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">I can\u2019t really go through that regimen. I can\u2019t go through what I want to go through when I\u2019m facing someone and talking to them and they\u2019re responding and I have to listen to what they\u2019re saying. I take in what they\u2019re saying and say, okay. I forget about what I want to say. And that\u2019s \u2013 I guess that\u2019s my problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Ah. Un huh. Yeah, when you want to kind of convey the disappointment and the frustration that you\u2019d been left with and he was able to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, well I wanted to clear up any feeling that it\u2019s not appropriate for me to trust these people or, yeah, through that (unclear) that I was sharing that I felt I guess. But also support a query sort of like \u2013 well this is what happened here. Why did this happen? I expected this. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">I asked him \u2013 he was in the middle of class. And I just said, \u2018can I speak to you?\u2019 And he just said \u2013 well, he gave me that time but I wasn\u2019t able to go through everything I wanted to. That was an important question I\u2019ve been saying because the guy\u2019s lying to my face. He\u2019s lying to my face and saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">things like, \u2018I said to them, Donald\u2019s a great guy,\u2019 but they said, \u2018you know, he\u2019s going to passes two or three companies on the way here every morning. How long before he just goes and works in one of those places.\u2019 But of course it was the reverse. There is no way that he concluded that I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200693\">do that or that he couldn\u2019t present them to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: He wouldn\u2019t even present you to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Because I didn\u2019t fit the basic profile of what they want. But it\u2019s hard. Someone\u2019s just staring you in the face and telling a bald lie. I can\u2019t call him on it. I\u2019m just not motivated to. The same thing when I quit on Saturday, the boss, Erik, asked me, \u2018well why? Why are you going? It was because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">of the conversation I had before with them, you know, I need this. You know you talk about treating people with respect, but you do not. It\u2019s not worth it for me to work here. Instead, the first thing out of my mouth was some excuse about what I\u2019m doing with my commitments. And then I got to that, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D2\">I don\u2019t make anyone understand these sort of truths that may convert them but are really important to me. I don\u2019t communicate what \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That are the actual reasons, your motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. The thing I\u2019d want to say. I don\u2019t act quickly enough on opportunities with people. Like if I want to pick this person for a partner or something I don\u2019t do it. But like a girl, I don\u2019t give her attention. I give everyone around her attention to avoid the impression that I care about her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">I\u2019m sort of afraid of what I want. But I don\u2019t know about the car dealing thing. It seems appealing. But it also seems like a mortgage other dreams I could be doing. I think I\u2019d enjoy the person to person contact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Of sales, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yes. I think I kind of am a salesman. Like I have a lot of the same thinking patterns. I\u2019m just not trained. Like I operate best when I know what people want. Maybe everybody does this, but I take what they want and I selectively speak to them based on what they want. I sort of filter <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">out the things that might offend or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561956\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Like something like talking to your boss about what you were feeling about him. Also recent \u2013 something internally for you in doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, so in short I didn\u2019t know, I mean I could have (unclear) training today.

[0:18:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Did you feel like you couldn\u2019t talk to me about it or something?

I guess I wasn\u2019t clear. I was just asking in general. I\u2019m not even sure why I asked. I felt like I\u2019ve asked too much in the recent past to change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">(Pause): [0:19:11 0:19:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">The thing is though, I mean this morning (Pause) I just had an OCD thing that felt like, just don\u2019t respond is the best plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: To me? Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: What was the OCD thing saying? What was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Just don\u2019t. Because I would have training or I\u2019d be at the company for something solid to happen there. Yeah, because if I said I was coming here it would preclude the possibility of my being hired at the job I was doing. On the other hand if I said I couldn\u2019t come then it would say for certain, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">then I wouldn\u2019t be here right now.

Well, yeah, so if you were hired you would have wanted to be able to work today.

Okay. I wondered if you felt like that would have been asking too much. You might have felt like that might have been asking too much of me to kind of make it more conditional or provisional or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019d rather not \u2013 it\u2019s strange because you\u2019re my therapist but I don\u2019t typically give people that level of insight into my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Hmm. You must have some reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Well yeah, it\u2019s conveyed as just an impulse but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what\u2019s in the impulse? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Just don\u2019t. You\u2019ll curse your luck or something. Like stepping on a crack in the sidewalk or something. A superstitious kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s something that you touched on before. Something about people knowing your plans and how there\u2019s like this kind of sense that they\u2019ll be affected if they\u2019re known.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Exactly. One of the worst things I hate is going to an interview and someone asking what I\u2019m interviewing for or are you going to an interview. I despise it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Ha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: I cannot stand it because it\u2019s my business and it might not go well. So fuck you for trying to have any insight into something that may be a failure. I despise it. There\u2019s nothing I dislike more than someone trying to uncover plans that are important to me and are sort of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: It really pisses you off, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: None of your business. That\u2019s something I don\u2019t say very well either. I mean there a temptation but it\u2019s very, it\u2019s almost violent, it seems like. Someone asks me something kind of offends me and I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t really want to tell you that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561956\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you do feel that strongly about it. There\u2019s something about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s like a superstitious certainty or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t like it at all. It\u2019s very threatening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does seem more along the lines of a protective kind of mechanism. Like you\u2019re trespassing here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yes. Like years ago applying to Birmingham was a very long process. It took like \u2013 but then (unclear) very quickly and then after the application there was some other stuff, hurdles to go through and I passed one hurdle and another hurdle and then learned like what two full nonsectarian (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">that I\u2019d been accepted, that I had a binding contract with Birmingham for me to go there and I couldn\u2019t back out. And so when I got that e-mail, I asked the Dean of International Affairs, so I said, is this a sure thing? Am I going here? Is there anything that could prevent me from going? She said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">\u2018no, you\u2019re going there for sure.\u2019 So after that I then told my parents that I\u2019d been accepted at Birmingham.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Only after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: After all that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You have that same kind of sensibility like I don\u2019t want them to know. It might affect my luck about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. In the interim, during the process I said nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: No details about anything did they see any vulnerability or weakness or what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I think that\u2019s kind of one part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: And so I don\u2019t know if I made the right decision today. It certainly feels like the wrong decision. I went there to clarify this. I hoped to reach the guy before he started teaching the class so I could go through things really with him, but I couldn\u2019t and it\u2019s pretty far away. I started an <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">hour and a half early and I only got there five minutes late. So. I just had the talk with him. He went through some sort of sales reversal and sort of shook my hand and turned me around and I sat back down in the class for a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: You were dealing with an expert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. And then I just sort of got up and left without saying anything. Everyone in the class (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: When you got back from the interview?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: What did they have you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Going to the interview?

Because they\u2019re the ones hiring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: And the class watches or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: No they don\u2019t. They just \u2013 they continued receiving instruction. But I touched them in some way at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">(Pause): [0:26:29 0:26:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: So after I talked to the guy I just \u2013 my plan was to do some reading and to visit a caf\u00e9 I knew where this interesting woman sometimes hangs out. I\u2019ve only spoken to her once but she\u2019s like really smart and spiritual. She\u2019s like 60 or something but she happens to be at this caf\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 had <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">been changed so I just after not going to the training, the guy said I only went to one today, but who knows if that\u2019s true? I didn\u2019t go to the training \u2013 or left the training. I just wandered around and did nothing. I mean I went too far on the red line and had to get out on the other side and go back. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E92\">I went to the caf\u00e9 which had been converted into something else and then went to the library to (unclear) books and then came here. I mean I haven\u2019t used my time well though I told myself that I would. My objection to the guy was that he had sort of wasted my time. But at the end, this is how I\u2019m spending <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E93\">it. It\u2019s sort of a point of pride. I wasn\u2019t treated well with them. It would have helped him for me to be there somehow for his credibility or something. But it would have helped me, too, but I\u2019d been treated in such a way that I didn\u2019t want to let him gain anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561956\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.

It\u2019s actually like I took a test drive in a car. It was kind of fun. It\u2019s not a bad thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">(Pause): [0:29:00 \u2013 0:29:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: (Unclear). Driving a new car. Or a different car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I had this sense like when I was selling this guitar on Craig\u2019s list, I mean my father was very upset that I was not very (unclear) like very skeptical and sort of judgmental that I\u2019d sold something for more than I\u2019d bought it for. It was like a used guitar. I\u2019d bought it for $200 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">sold it for $300. A 12-string. I\u2019d advertised it in such a way that played up its qualities and so the person thought it was worth $300. So I realized that there\u2019s like a perceived value which can be built up in the customer and there\u2019s a sort of inherent value. But for me it\u2019s not its actual value. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD2\">And if you build up someone\u2019s appreciation for something, it\u2019s actual (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of created value, but it\u2019s a value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">(Pause): [0:30:24 \u2013 0:30:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, I can\u2019t organize my time. Just like I can\u2019t organize social interactions. I can\u2019t organize my time. I need to \u2013 like for this morning it would have been nice if I had rehearsed \u2013 like I knew exactly what I was going to do. I knew this guy was going to say you came in late or you have something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">that conflicts with the schedule or give some reason why I was in the wrong. I knew that and I knew the next thing I\u2019d say to that. And my questions were timed to just move the progression along to basically how I feel. But I couldn\u2019t get to the next question. I\u2019d just forget it because I\u2019d be listening <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201072\">to his saying, okay, like, so what I need I think is to be able to rehearse those things at least, or to become more skilled in maintaining my own agenda in intercourse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Did you get a little nervous?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: No. Not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Almost like he had \u2013 was it more like he was kind of influential in the conversation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: You know, in this case \u2013 he has a skill.

What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking, you wouldn\u2019t want to \u2013 what I was imagining was that you wouldn\u2019t want to just see that you needed to write things down to remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Well, of course not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: Like what would you think of a performer or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that they needed to look at the script while they were onstage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: He did fill me with a motivation, though. Like that\u2019s when I realized I kind of do the same thing with people. I mean the easiest way to work with people sometimes is to build up what they want. So he would always talk to people like, \u2018oh, you want money, you want this and this and this?\u2019 And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">so you felt a sense of purpose going through the training. So that was sort of a gift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but it was kind of a waste of time though. They were going to \u2013 you went out there and did all that and they were just going to tell you that you live too far away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: I mean why wouldn\u2019t they tell you from the outset?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Does he have any other contacts anywhere?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. To hear him talk. One woman came in and said he\u2019d trained her five years ago and that he\u2019d come a long way since then like he used to sound kind of crazy. And the guy would be taking cell phone calls in the middle of class and he\u2019s like a kind of drill sergeant and then someone calls <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D1\">and he\u2019d say, \u2018hello, I\u2019m teaching class. Say, hello, class.\u2019 Like he\u2019s taking sales calls during class. Yeah, like thank you for the reasonable point of view. Like why not just say you\u2019re too far away because like this guy needs to keep everyone involved as much as possible on the off chance that they <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D2\">might not come back if he does it somewhere else. Like he\u2019s going to be doing the training next week at another company and the next week at another company. But if I say you know, great, I\u2019ll see you next week. There\u2019s no guarantee that I\u2019ll be there. For him I represent money as long as I\u2019m there <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D3\">in the room. And I knew this coming in. Like coming in yesterday I knew that there wasn\u2019t really a point for me being there but I went in just because I wanted to show this guy \u2013 continue working with this guy in some sense because he does have a lot of other contacts and so that he might place me somewhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D4\">else. But by walking out of his class today I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a professional, but that probably has some effect on people. I mean to just get up and walk out of their class. Like if I just got up now and said nothing and walked out, that wouldn\u2019t be so good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it would make a statement. Yeah.

I knew not to trust the guy from the moment that he said, \u2018you\u2019re going to have to trust me.\u2019 And that rule has held up. If someone asks you to trust them \u2013 do not trust them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s also interesting that you, you know you gave him a shot.

I was really quite hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t know if it was just that I had sort of held out hope that I could do the interview well, but I did horrible in the interview. I got in there and said \u2013 they sort of made me go around a table to a place other than where I\u2019d been intending to sit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: And then they said, \u2018so, you\u2019re not []. And I said, \u2018I\u2019m not [].\u2019 And then they said, \u2018describe yourself.\u2019 And I started off with being involved with the Church or something. I\u2019m not that good at describing myself. Another thing I could have done like (unclear). I mean that\u2019s not something I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201511\">practiced beforehand, that question, \u2018tell me a little about yourself.\u2019 That\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve practiced. I think most people like talking about themselves. I have no idea what I can share with people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah! It is a skill. Like interviewing in that context you\u2019ve got to kind of \u2013 how much do you share and how much do you not share? I mean is that what he tries to \u2013 is that what the class is all about? Or no, he\u2019s training you to be sales people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Yes, he\u2019s saying things like you know, just be friendly with the customers. Cultivate a relationship. Christ doesn\u2019t sell products. Trust sells products. And you have to convince the customer that you\u2019re the one that\u2019s giving them the best deal and there are certain like ways of saying things <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201551\">\u2013 questions you don\u2019t want to ask \u2013 yes or no questions. Do you want a car? Yes or no. You want to ask, which car do you want? Or, which car are you looking at today? What do you like in a car? Do you like this in a car? You might say no. Do you like this? No. That sort of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like the interview sounds like they tried to throw you, too \u2013 but did you feel they were trying to throw you too by, \u2018not there \u2013 there\u201d? They must do that routinely to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: That must be some psychological trick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, I\u2019m sure. Every time I go to a company I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s some sort of system I don\u2019t understand. And I don\u2019t know what to chalk up to the company just being the company or like some sort of process I\u2019m being put through. Yeah. Like the secretary waits five minutes before giving <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D1\">me the paperclip I asked for like how am I even supposed to deal with this? And they\u2019re watching to see how I deal with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Right, right, right.

How much do you trust somebody and you know, the last <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201631\">couple of days you really making a bit of a gamble on, I mean judge for yourself, trying to say, okay, I don\u2019t know that I really trust this guy but I\u2019ll give him a go to help me out. He says he\u2019s going to do it. And I\u2019m telling him from the outset \u2013 don\u2019t disappoint me. You know.

So I\u2019m never of a piece with them. And I can earn their respect. I don\u2019t feel left out. But that\u2019s also an element of the hurt is that I never quite fit in and so I told the people (unclear) that I\u2019d been accepted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">Birmingham once and this is something I (unclear) and you know I put down, this and this and this, and owned my own business and I need a job that puts me in contact with people, then the people come to me and I work for the team and I compete with the team. And I help the team and I\u2019m willing to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B2\">helped by the team. I\u2019m not communicating what I meant to because I\u2019m forgetting but there\u2019s something about the awkwardness of putting myself out there on this lower rung and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it doesn\u2019t seem like your milieu, quite.

I mean I go into these places expecting like okay this will be \u2013 I\u2019m better than this and I\u2019ll dominate here and I\u2019ll be great. Not that I\u2019m not or I don\u2019t \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t provide any comfort. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F1\">Like it\u2019s not what I want.

That grocery store wasn\u2019t easy. I was a really good employee once I checked with the boss and said, okay, I need this, this and this.
