It\u2019s something I\u2019m not used to. I was just thinking about how there\u2019s just so many more pedestrians here. And they\u2019re so annoying but yet I\u2019m one of them, too. On weekends I walk around. Anyways, how are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good. Yea. Hey, checking in about next week. I am going to be in. What\u2026 do you know what your plans are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Oh, Monday. I\u2019m off Friday, Monday and Tuesday. Is traffic going to be crazy? It shouldn\u2019t be, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I would guess by this time of the day, no. I mean, it\u2019s tricky getting over here between\u2026 until like 1:00 or so or 2:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: If anything I\u2019ll take a day trip somewhere.

I mean, I can\u2019t afford it. I wish I was saying like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to Miami.\u201d No, not yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yea, so you get\u2026 are you just taking some time off for yourself? Is it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yea. I actually have not taken a single vacation day since I started in July. That was pointed out to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Is that right? Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So I mean, we\u2019ve had\u2026 because we work in a university, there\u2019s a lot of like special days that we just get off. But I haven\u2019t used a single vacation day. So I was like, oh, maybe I should do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: And are you guys ever closed over like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: We\u2019re closed Monday. We\u2019re closed this Friday. We\u2019re closed for graduation which is on the\u2026 like May 19 or something. So yea, we have a lot of days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What about over like Jamestmas holidays and stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yea, we got a week off.  No, so it\u2019s\u2026 I have had some breaks but just not\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of people that just\u2026 they take off\u2026 sick days are based on like\u2026 it\u2019s like the honest policy or something. They call it just whenever you need it, we believe you. And my associate director was joking the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">other day how like, \u201cYea, there\u2019s the regulars who once a month guaranteed they\u2019ll take their sick day or just people who just go on vacation.\u201d Like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to the beach.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">And I feel bad because I wish I was at a point that I could afford to do something. I like staycations. I like just staying at home but not for too long because then I get depressed. I wish I could travel or spend quality time with people. But there\u2019s no one to spend quality time with. Brian has a crazy <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">schedule and I can\u2019t count on him really. And then my family is not here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I had an interesting weekend. Friday was calm. Saturday Brian had told me that he would be in Vermont because he was teaching there. And he had a very crazy schedule. I think Friday during the day he had to teach and then he went home and napped for a while. And then Friday night from 11 pm to 7 am <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">he worked at the hospital and then got in his car and drove to Vermont to teach from 9:00 to 5:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">And so he had said, \u201cIf you\u2019re free on Saturday come stay with me.\u201d And I was really excited about that because we had always joked about doing that. He had always kind of said when we just met like, \u201cOh, I go out of town all the time. Maybe you could come with me.\u201d And I\u2019ve always wanted to do that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">But this is the first time he actually asked me so I was all excited.  And it was Saturday night. So of course I have this fantasy of, oh, I\u2019m going to get all dressed up and he\u2019s going to take me to dinner. And then maybe we\u2019ll take it easy because he\u2019s exhausted. But I got there all dressed up.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: In Vermont.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: In Vermont. Got there like around 6:00 and he looked exhausted. I mean, he\u2019d been up for a long time and I hadn\u2019t had dinner. And he just laid down and we pretty much just went to sleep from 7 pm till the next morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">But it\u2019s funny. I remember thinking in advance like, hmm. It\u2019s 6 pm. I ran four miles today. I must\u2026 I\u2019m getting hungry.  That morning all I had eaten was like eggs and fruit or something. And so I had to eat dinner. But it\u2019s like when I\u2019m with him, I so\u2026 there\u2019s two feelings. I\u2019m like kind of offended <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">that he won\u2019t look out for me and be like, \u201cAre you hungry? Have you eaten?\u201d I want to be taken care of. But the side that ends up winning with me is just I don\u2019t want to bother him. He\u2019s worked really hard. He needs to sleep. I can handle starvation for one night and I just go to sleep. And I went to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Oh, but without dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yea. (chuckling) I just like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: No, no, no. I see. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: And it was just funny because I did my hair. I wore heels. And he commented on how pretty I looked. But then it\u2019s like I took everything off and, OK, we\u2019re going to sleep now. So\u2026 but that\u2019s just like our relationship. We spend all our time in bed. That\u2019s all we do. And I understand he had a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">very crazy schedule. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">And then the next morning he got up at like 6:00 in the morning because that\u2019s his regular wake up time and I had slept so many hours I was awake. I didn\u2019t mind. So we got up. He took me to breakfast which was very nice. We went to a really cute place and actually talked and had conversation. And he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">says sweet things. At the end of it he was hugging me and he said, \u201cYou know what\u2019s funny. We got to the restaurant and we were the first ones there. And then the whole restaurant filled up and I didn\u2019t even notice because I was just so focused on you.\u201d He was sweet. And we hugged and he paid for breakfast. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">And then he asked, \u201cCan I fill up your tank?\u201d He filled up my tank. He took care of me. I think\u2026 and then I started thinking, well, last night he must have been completely out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And so I was like not a big deal. I went hungry. I got a good breakfast the next day, whatever. And then he had to go back and teach that day again from 8:00 to 4:00.  So he did that. I went home, did my day and it\u2019s getting hot, right? I heard a rumor somewhere that today was supposed to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">75 and my apartment gets so freaking warm. So I had bought an AC recently and he had offered to install it for me. And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting really hot.\u201d I had been asking him for a few days and he said, \u201cYou know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. When I come home from the city, from Vermont, when I come into <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">the city I\u2019ll do that. I\u2019ll just drop by for a little bit and install it.\u201d And he did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">So at the end of the day he came. He couldn\u2019t find parking because my neighborhood sucks like that. And so he parked illegally in a corner and said, \u201cCome down. Sit in my car. Give me your keys and I\u2019ll do it all for you.\u201d And he did it really quickly. (chuckling) So I\u2019m sitting in his car and reflecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">on what a nice day we had and everything is fine. And I\u2019ve never snooped before. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">I\u2019ve stayed at his house. He\u2019s taken a shower like in his home, in his family home. I could\u2019ve looked through stuff and I just never did, never looked through his phone even though he barely ever leaves it there. I remember it used to impress me that James used to leave it face up like and go take a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">shower. And I\u2019d be thinking to myself like, \u201cWow. This guy has nothing to hide. Brian would never do that.\u201d Anyways, for some reason I felt like snooping. He had some papers right on top there about the courses he had just trained and I was reading through them and it was all this gun stuff and medic <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">stuff. And then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Gun stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well, he trains military and cops in what to do if someone has a gunshot wound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Oh, and so he has to get up on\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like an all-day training. So as part of the training is shooting, defense and how to be a better shooter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: And then his part is the medical part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Oh, OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like a company\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: \u2026that different professionals this guy he works with is ex-military he heads the whole thing and he does the medical portion of it. So I started snooping and I looked in his glove compartment. It was interesting because the day before when I got to the motel he was looking at me upstairs <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">from the balcony. He was like, \u201cHey, can you get me my charger?\u201d And he unlocked his car. And he\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s in the center console.\u201d Yea, in the center console. And I stuck my hand in there. I was like, \u201cIs this it? Is this it?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">And so I knew there was nothing in there. I had already looked in there the day before. But for some reason I was just looking so I stick my hand in there and I see a piece of mail that says his name, his wife\u2019s name, whatever. It\u2019s a piece of mail. Back to the reality, oh yea, he\u2019s married and they <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">live together.  And then I find another piece of paper in there and I take it out. And it\u2019s a little notepad, like a little piece of paper from a notepad that big that says Best Western on it, hotel stationary. And it says, \u201cI, Francesca so-and-so, Brian completely agree to\u2026\u201d like all this explicit sexual stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Oh, on the notepad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: On the notepad. Like her name, her full name. \u201cI agree to comply with whatever he tells me to do. To have all my holes violated. To be fucked no matter how hard I scream and ask for him to stop. Signed\u2026\u201d and her signature was there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Like a contract. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Like a contract. And on the back it seems like it\u2019s something filled out afterwards like, \u201cI, Francesca so-and-so, thank you for treating me like a whore. I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I protested and screamed and it hurt and I might bleed for a few days. Signed\u2026\u201d And my heart just sank. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">And I went numb and my whole body was on fire. And I was like, \u201cWhat do I do? What do I do with this information?\u201d It hurt for a variety of reasons. Number one, we do stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019ll write stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yea, he\u2019s made me do that. And I guess I was aware that he\u2019s done stuff like that in the past.  But not knowing how recent this piece of paper was. The thought that he could possibly be doing these intimate things with someone else. It\u2019s like someone took a jackhammer to my face. It was just so painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: To your face, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: The second thing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: A jackhammer to your face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yea.

Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: \u2026that there\u2019s a possibility.

I\u2019ve never cheated on you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yea. No, I remember.

Not enough for him. And also what went through my head is this is not about me. This is about him. This is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">not that, \u201cMelanie, you\u2019re not enough. You\u2019re not pretty enough. You don\u2019t give him enough.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">It\u2019s completely like this is what he needs for his ego. He needs to be the big and powerful daddy with a huge cock to many women, not just you. This isn\u2019t about you. He needs that because of his messed up history. And he has just such fragile self-esteem. That\u2019s what he thrives on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">And then the next thought was, \u201cWow. I can\u2019t believe when he tells me, \u2018I don\u2019t have time to take you to dinner or go for a walk or just watch a movie with you.\u2019\u201d  That all he ever seems to have time for is to come over and have sex with me, cuddle and go to sleep. But he finds some time to go to a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">Best Western hotel with some girl and do this to her. I thought you didn\u2019t have extra time. So I took the note and I stuck it in my pocket. And I decided I\u2019m not going to say anything tonight because if I do it\u2019s going to\u2026 I\u2019m going to destroy him with my words. I\u2019m just going to put him down and call <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">him a piece of shit and tell him I never want to speak to him again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Were you feeling that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You were. OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yea. I really\u2026 like I can feel it all over my body. It\u2019s on my feet and it\u2019s going up, the tension and the anger.  And I felt like saying like, \u201cYou piece of shit. Yea, I know I wasn\u2019t perfect but this wasn\u2019t a perfect relationship. You\u2019re cheating on your wife. I was dicking around looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">for a real relationship. But now after what\u2019s happened in the past few weeks and me being completely open and honest with you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">Honestly like I got rid of all telephone numbers, all apps, all everything. I\u2019m not talking to Peter. I\u2019m not\u2026 I erased all of that and I told Brian I\u2019m going to be completely honest and faithful from now on and I expect the same. And it was just so hurtful thinking like, \u201cWow. If this is recent I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">believe... what a piece of shit.\u201d And at the same time I thought it doesn\u2019t take away that I think he loves me. I do believe him when he says he loves me and he cares and what we have is special and different.  But it doesn\u2019t matter to me because if he\u2019s sleeping with other women, it just\u2026 it won\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F2\">work. I need him to be loyal.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: You need that loyalty. Yea, it\u2019s making me think about\u2026 for some reason I was thinking about the note that when it was written. And that it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: I had brought it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking about how it seemed to kind of indicate a one-way loyalty. That\u2026 and I was wondering if like the\u2026 if there\u2019s anything to the dynamic of it being a one-way loyalty at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: What do you mean? She was only loyal to him and his wishes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yea, not vice versa. And I was wondering if it can feel that way. I mean, actually for some reason I guess I\u2019m just caught by you sort of saying\u2026 you saying in a lot of ways, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be loyal to you. But I need you to be loyal back.\u201d  And in some ways it\u2019s such a\u2026 it\u2019s a different than <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">that note implies of kind of a\u2026 what I would sense in a one-way loyalty. And in some ways that I hear it in you a one-way loyalty that I hear is kind of implied sometimes at least in the fantasy between the two of you, a one-way. You Brian be my pet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: I am serving him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: The loyal pet but the owner not necessarily being\u2026 the owner might have more than one pet. And not to say that that\u2019s the case but thinking like the loyalty is one-way in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Right. But for some reason like when we play like that in bed and everything, I know that it\u2019s not like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Everything he\u2019s doing, it\u2019s for me. It\u2019s because he\u2019s doing it because it turns me on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. OK. So it\u2019s kind of in the context of a play, of kind of a play kind of context.  As opposed to it being kind of outside that boundary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: And I mean it\u2019s almost like I call it debriefing. We debrief afterwards. When we\u2019re just cuddling and holding each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yea, I know you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: He\u2019ll talk to me. I said\u2026 I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cOh my God. When you said that, I wasn\u2019t expecting it. But I can\u2019t believe that turned me on.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYea, I knew it would and that\u2019s why I tried. And I\u2019m glad that it worked.\u201d And it\u2019s like a mutual arrangement even though while we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">playing, it might seem like it\u2019s all for him because that\u2019s what\u2019s turning me on\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yes. No, that\u2019s the play element.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: \u2026to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: But you stop the play and then it\u2019s\u2026 and then you\u2019re asking him to go, \u201cThat was just play, right?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Right. And it feels like that. So when he came back out to the car, he finished quickly. And right away he could tell something was wrong. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You look worried. There\u2019s\u2026 you\u2019re looking at me funny.\u201d  And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cThis bastard knows I found the note.\u201d That <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">was my first thought and I tried to act as normal as possible. \u201cThank you so much for doing that for me. I\u2019m going to be so nice and cold and comfortable tonight.\u201d Gave him a hug and he looks at me. He\u2019s like, \u201cAre you sure? Are you OK?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: He knew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: And he got in his car and he left and I walked away. And the first thing I planned to do was create a face\u2026 a fake Facebook account and look up this girl by first and last name. And I found her and who knows if it\u2019s her. But it is a college student from like\u2026 what is it \u2013 some community college. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">I wasn\u2019t impressed. I was waiting to see someone completely hot and oh my God, of course.  And I was just like, seriously? She just looked regular. But I know he gets very turned on by being with young girls. She\u2019s probably 21 or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Oh, so she\u2019s college age, too. Not just going there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: It says she still works at Starbucks. Nothing against people who work at Starbucks but he\u2019s always ranting and raving about how proud he is of me, that he can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s with me and on top of that I\u2019m a psychologist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re a psychologist then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I\u2019m a professional and I have a doctorate. But of course different things turn people on. And sometimes it turns him on to be with somebody who has an associate\u2019s degree or a high school degree. He just gets off on different things and I get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">So as I\u2019m trying to make this fake account and trying to just breathe and keep from crying because I just want to pull it together and find out as quickly as I can what\u2019s the story here.  The phone rings and it\u2019s him. (chuckling) And I guess I sounded surprised answering the phone. And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">wrong? You sound surprised to hear from me.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, you just left my house. I thought you were driving home.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYea, but can\u2019t I call you? I missed you. I wanted to talk.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, OK.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">And then he was trying to fish again. Like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You sound weird.\u201d And I didn\u2019t want to say anything yet because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to say. And pretty quickly I got off the phone again. Like, \u201cNo, I promise. Everything is fine.\u201d And I made an account, like just very\u2026 like some\u2026 pretended <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">to be like a young college girl. I put a fake picture of a bunch of girls standing together so you can\u2019t even tell who\u2019s who and I just messaged her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">I sent her a private message saying something like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry to bother you. And this may seem kind of awkward but I just started seeing this guy. I don\u2019t know if you know him but his name is this and he\u2019s a nurse and he\u2019s tall and dark hair. And anyways, we\u2019re just starting to see each other <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">and I have some doubts about whether or not I can trust him. And I came\u2026 I was snooping through some of his stuff and I came across your name so I was just curious if you guys were talking now or if this was from something from the past. Girl-to-girl, I just wanted to know can I trust this guy?\u201d She <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C52\">hasn\u2019t written me back. In fact, before I left work again I sent her a quick message saying something like, \u201cSorry to bother you if this isn\u2019t the right Francesca but I really just want to know. Please write back if you can.\u201d She hasn\u2019t written back. And went to sleep, didn\u2019t get any answers. I normally <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C53\">sleep until like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: This is last night. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: This is last night. I normally sleep until 8 o\u2019clock when I have to be in work at 8:45. By 6:30 I was awake and I couldn\u2019t sleep. And got up, went to work early. And I had a bunch of no shows. I had two no shows in a row. So I had two free hours. And I got on Gchat and I noticed that Brian was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">on. And so I was like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Are you doing your homework?\u201d because he had a paper to write. And he\u2019s like, \u201cYea. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now. Hey, were you upset about something last night?\u201d asking again. And I said, \u201cYea, I actually was.\u201d I felt like I was ready to talk to him about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C92\">it at that point. And I said, \u201cI have no shows. Do you want to talk on the phone?\u201d And he said, \u201cYea. Call my house.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">So I called him and it\u2019s exactly what I expected. He was very serious and I said, \u201cBrian, do you know what I\u2019m upset about? When you came out to your car you noticed I was upset about something. Do you know what it is I\u2019m going to talk to you about?\u201d  He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t have a frigging clue,\u201d and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">started getting very defensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">And then I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you about Francesca so-and-so and about how you took her to the Best Western hotel and had her write a contract about how hard you were going to fuck her and how you were going to hurt her. And I want to find out more about that and why you did that.\u201d And he\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">\u201cWho?\u201d And I repeated the name and he\u2019s like, \u201cI seriously have no clue who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d And I was like, \u201cBrian, I found the note. I have the note in my house. I took it from your car.\u201d And he was like, \u201cIf that\u2019s who I think it is then that was like from a long time ago.\u201d And I was like\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD2\">and he\u2019s said, \u201cOver a year ago.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">Mind you, we\u2019ve been together a year and a half. I said, \u201cWell, I know that that\u2019s not true because this is a new car. You just got this car last spring.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYea, but I bet it\u2019s like paper that I stuck in there from my old car.\u201d I was like, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. If you\u2019re like cleaning <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">out your car\u2026\u201d And he keeps this new car of his really pristine clean. His old car used to be a piece of garbage. He just like threw garbage in there. I was like, \u201cIf you were just cleaning out your car, you wouldn\u2019t keep pieces of paper like this and I know your wife occasionally drives your car. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF2\">wouldn\u2019t care if she found this? So it\u2019s just very confusing to me if this wasn\u2019t done recently why you would have this in your car.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">And he got kind of mean. He was like, \u201cWell, if you would shut your mouth for just a minute, I could explain myself.\u201d  And I was like, \u201cI\u2019m controlling myself and the reason I didn\u2019t talk to you about this yesterday is because I was going to be really mean. And I\u2019ve decided to try to make this a mature <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">conversation. So don\u2019t be mean to me.\u201d And so he stopped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">And he completely denied it and said, \u201cYes. If that\u2019s who I think it is, I think it\u2019s some girl that I met and we did that once and that was a long time ago. But I promise you that that is in no way recent.\u201d And at first I wasn\u2019t believing it. But I don\u2019t know what happened that he tried to turn it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">around on me in saying like, \u201cWell, you\u2019re one to talk,\u201d or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">And I was like, \u201cWe know my sins. Let\u2019s leave my sins out of this. And I\u2019m not even so sure they\u2019re sins because you\u2019re married and I was trying to find a real relationship and whatever. Fresh start since this whole thing happened with the drinking incident. I told you I was going to be loyal. I\u2019m being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">loyal. And by the way after I found that note, I went on OkCupid again just to check if your account was still active and it says that you were on yesterday. So explain that as well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">And he\u2019s told me before, \u201cOh, I never\u2026. I have a hundred windows that open up whenever I turn on my computer. When I do homework those windows pop up and I haven\u2019t even gone to OkCupid and that\u2019s why it says I was there yesterday.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, you know what? I\u2019m not OK with that. If you\u2019re being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">loyal to me, I need you to delete that. Are you going to be OK with doing that? Can you delete that for me?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m fucking doing it right now as we speak on the computer.\u201d \u201cAnd I was like I just I can\u2019t comprehend why that would be in your car if it was from a long time ago.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">And he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention. I don\u2019t know.\u201d And in a way I started to believe it because he\u2019s not that careful. Like the time he left his phone when his wife was getting dressed in the room and I was texting him and his wife could just pick it up and read it and the fact that his wife knows. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">I, again, clarified because I think it\u2019s so hard for my brain to understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">Like I said to him, \u201cWhat would she think if she found that in your car?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this. She knows this about me.\u201d I was like, \u201cSo she knows that you fuck other women occasionally.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYes.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAnd she just chooses to live in denial about it?\u201d And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB1\">like\u2026 that\u2019s when he said, \u201cIf you would just shut up for a minute, I could explain.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, explain.\u201d And he says, \u201cShe\u2026 that\u2019s just the way it is. We don\u2019t talk about it. She knows I do this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">I guess if they\u2019re not having sex, I mean, it\u2019s a sexless marriage and I guess she accepts it. But I said, \u201cBut something so explicit, she wouldn\u2019t freak out about it? Let me ask you this. Does she know that you\u2019re with me?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cBut she assumes that you\u2019re fucking other women.\u201d He said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD1\">\u201cYes.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to make it really clear. I\u2019m not your wife. I\u2019m not OK with it at all.\u201d (pause) And at the end of the conversation I don\u2019t know if I don\u2019t care or if I believe him. But I wasn\u2019t mad anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yea, what were you feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">CLIENT: You know how I\u2019ve told you that whenever he does something that really hurt me, it really hurts intensely and then kind of I feel close to him again and we talk things out.  And everything is just whoosh, swept away. And that\u2019s what happened this morning in the conversation. And even now I told <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E11\">him in the conversation. I said, \u201cIf I ask Francesca when this happened, is she going to tell me the same thing that it was over a year ago?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what? If that\u2019s what you feel you need to do, go ahead and do it. But I\u2019m telling you it was a long time ago.\u201d And I didn\u2019t say anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E12\">more. But I hope she responds. I don\u2019t know what to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">THERAPIST: What are you\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">CLIENT: If I were to say this to any of my friends\u2026 I was too embarrassed to even tell my friend, Carly, at work. Because anybody would be like, \u201cAre you a freaking idiot?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Why? What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">CLIENT: Of course it\u2019s recent. His story doesn\u2019t make any sense. And the fact that he took me to a hotel and it felt good.  He had always kind of told me these stories about how he used to take some\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Oh, and that was at a, what, hotel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yea, he took these girls to the\u2026 these young girls to the hotel sometimes because they would have dorm roommates. He couldn\u2019t take them back to his house. Or how about the one time that some girl told him that she was in college and then she found out she was a senior in high school, had just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">turned 18. Of course he couldn\u2019t fuck her at her parent\u2019s house so he took her to a hotel room and had always kind of teased them. Like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not enough of a whore that you need a hotel room. I wanted to be taken to a hotel room.\u201d And here we are finally going to a hotel room and it was like a really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED2\">nice, loving time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yea, right. And right after that you found the note.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: And then it\u2019s like here\u2019s a note. And a part of me even felt like jealous. How dare you do this with other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t even get this at the hotel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: No, I was thinking\u2026 well, you didn\u2019t get what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: Well, like we had sex but it was nothing compared to the normal sex because he had been up for 36 hours. We had sex for about an hour and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yea. That he got really into it with this Francesca. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: And I get that all the time. But I hadn\u2019t had it the night before. And a part of me was like, pshaw. But it\u2019s like\u2026 and I automatically after the conversation\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: It brought up\u2026 that\u2019s important. You kind of said it brought that sort of feeling of\u2026 and withholding something from you or something that he gave to somebody else and kind of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: I mean, and he never withholds that from me. If I want it rough like that, he\u2019ll give it to me. But the fact that he\u2019s giving it to other people, too, I\u2019m not OK with that. (pause) I think anybody who would be listening to me would be like, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2026 I mean, what I hear you saying is that, yea, it doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test to you, right?  But all this stuff and yet\u2026 and I know there\u2019s the level you feeling angry by it, angry with him about it. But I also hear like something in you wants to\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right to say <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">but wants to find a way to forgive him. Wants to find a way to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: Because I know he\u2019s not perfect and I even told him on the phone. I said, \u201cThe reason I\u2019m not feeling so sad and insecure right now, yea, of course a part of me is insecure. But more than that I know that this is about you and your ego and what you need. You need to be all that to different <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">women. And maybe I\u2019m not enough. Maybe there\u2019s something wrong with you that you need to get this from different people. It\u2019s like validating.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yea, what is it about him that needs do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: He stayed quiet.  He listened to that. And I said\u2026 I gave him the chance. I said, \u201cI\u2019m giving you the opportunity. Tell me right now if that\u2019s what you need and that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work because I\u2019m not going to judge you. I\u2019ll just walk away because I can\u2019t be with you if you\u2019re not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201091\">to be loyal. So you need to tell you right now. Because I promise you if anything else comes up that I suspect that you\u2019re being loyal to me, I Brian never talk to you again.\u201d And I know that he thinks that I Brian never be able to do that. But I swear to you. I have\u2026 I\u2019m able to just shut off like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201092\">that. I\u2019ve stopped talking to my father. My best friend in high school who stabbed me in the back, I stopped talking to her for three years. I can do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">THERAPIST: What would it mean\u2026 why would it be this point that would do it, do you think? What is it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s like a fresh start. Because I feel like I scared the shit out of myself a few weeks ago when I did that, when I acted like a complete imbecile.  Could\u2019ve risked my career, could\u2019ve risked my life. Oh, I got my wallet mailed back. Did I tell you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: An ETA. I think that I feel asleep on the subway. Can you imagine? I must have looked like a homeless person. I could\u2019ve been raped. Anything could\u2019ve happened. And I think I really, really scared myself. And I just like\u2026 I want to start new. And I don\u2019t want to mess anymore and I want to try <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201111\">to be more honest. (crying) And so that\u2019s why if he\u2019s not going to be honest with me, then I can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s not fair. (pause) I feel kind of foolish, though, for just being so forgiving.  But it\u2019s like at the end of the conversation all I wanted to do was have catharsis and have sex with him because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201112\">that would make it all better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">THERAPIST: No, I sense that you felt like you wanted to find a way to forgive him and try to find a way to make it right or something. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">CLIENT: Now if this girl ends up writing me back and saying like, \u201cOh yea, that happened a week ago or something,\u201d there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be able to explain himself out of that one. That\u2019ll change things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yea, do you think\u2026 I mean, what do you\u2026 I mean even the way you\u2019re talking with me right now I can kind of sense that there\u2019s a little bit of a kind of a step\u2026 a few steps back from how you\u2019re feeling. Is it\u2026 I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to be a lot more careful. I\u2019m not going to trust him but I don\u2019t think I ever trusted him blindly but now even less so.  It\u2019s almost like now he has to earn my trust. (pause) But it didn\u2019t feel like it used to. If something like this had happened before\u2026 remember when I found that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201191\">picture on his phone of the girl. Before I used to be vengeful like, \u201cHa, you\u2019ll see. This weekend I\u2019m going to go out with my friends and I\u2019m going to have a few drinks and I\u2019m going to see who I can give my number to.\u201d And I don\u2019t feel that way this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">CLIENT: In fact the thought went through my mind. Patrice has already called me. My friend, she said, \u201cOh, can we hang out? Let\u2019s go out.\u201d And hearing\u2026 like the thought ran through my mind like, \u201cOh Melanie, you\u2019re basically single. You have no reason to be loyal to this guy. You can go out and have <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D1\">fun. In fact, you should activate your dating accounts right now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">CLIENT: But I said to myself, \u201cNo. I want this to work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yea. And you\u2026 I mean, and also asking him about what\u2019s going on here?  And trying to be very straight and direct with him about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">CLIENT: He thanked me at the end. He said, \u201cThank you for trying to be rational and calm and talking to me through this. And I have very strong feelings for you. And I love you. And I don\u2019t want to lose you. And I promise you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">THERAPIST: When did you tell him about\u2026 when did you make the comment to him about\u2026 when was it that you made that comment about, \u201cListen, if it\u2019s more than one person, your just ego needs that.\u201d When did you put that out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">CLIENT: Today.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563459\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">THERAPIST: That was today. Yea, yea. That\u2019s the sense of, \u201cTell me what\u2019s really going on here. OK, let\u2019s really face this. What is inside of you? What\u2019s going on? Tell me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D\">CLIENT: Because maybe his wife acknowledged that and accepted it.

I think that\u2019s part of the dilemma you face is if that\u2019s part of the package here, it\u2019s not easy to kind of keep them separated.  And I think in a way you\u2019re trying to put it all together actually in some way. Like, \u201cOK, on this one <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F1\">side, well, we\u2019ve got this powerful relationship and I want it.\u201d And the play is tremendously powerful between you two, the sexual component. And\u2026 but you got to know what\u2019s really going on under the mask. Or is the mask\u2026 is it real?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20131\">CLIENT: Yea, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on sometimes under there. (crying) You know what just made me cry? I was thinking about how good it is what you do, how you do it. I can sit there and help me make sense out of everything and not judge it.  And I know it\u2019s possible. I do it all day with people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201311\">But it\u2019s just different when you\u2019re sitting in this chair because I just\u2026 I judge myself so harshly right now. Am I making the right decision? I can\u2019t even tell my close friend, \u201cOh yea, I found this note and we\u2019re back to normal now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20133\">THERAPIST: Yea, I think there\u2019s something to that. I think it\u2019s been something that you\u2019ve been really needing. Now watch out for those Kleenex by the way. They are... did you notice that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20135\">CLIENT: Menthol. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20137\">THERAPIST: I know. I bought the wrong brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20139\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve done that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t even realize they were Vicks.

But it seems like, yea, you\u2019re digging at something inside of yourself that\u2019s something that\u2019s very important. Just the way you were trying to dig at Brian.  Like, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s\u2026 we\u2019re not going to judge. I just want to know.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20141\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t jump to conclusions.

What are you both looking for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20145\">CLIENT: I feel like we\u2019re getting closer. He finishes classes this semester in four weeks and then he has clinicals which is just like a few hours a week at a clinic shadowing a nurse practitioner and then he\u2019s done. And he keeps talking about potentially\u2026 over breakfast he was telling me, \u201cMy life <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201451\">could really go two ways.\u201d It\u2019s like he\u2019s been a paramedic and then ER nurse and had this crazy schedule. And basically worked his ass off taking on more hours than any human should and sacrificed being a father.  Having a life, being a husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20147\">So he was talking about how as this draws to a close he\u2019s going to have the choice like, \u201cDo I want to get a job that pays really well but continues to have this kind of hectic schedule or do I want to kind of have a life?\u201d And he\u2019s not sure yet what he\u2019s going to choose. I keep thinking like if he <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201471\">chooses having a life maybe that might include me. It\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for. Who knows? I try to take it one thing at a time and right now I\u2019m dealing with what I just found in his car.
