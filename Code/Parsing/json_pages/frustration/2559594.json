So I thought about that some and I think the answer breaks up into some of them never existed. Some of them lost track of and I think some of them I suppressed because I did not, I do not want to face them sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">so there were times when I did not want to be in this marriage. I don't think it's really an overriding desire, but it's something I definitely think I have wanted during this time. And so, those are (Pause), that's a hard one, too, that we have to face, or something, and so I think that's where some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">of those went.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(Pause): [00:01:34 00:01:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Um hmm [yes].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: That's all I have on the subject, but even so, I thought I'd -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: There's a lot in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(Pause): [00:01:47 00:01:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(Pause): [00:01:59 00:02:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Well, you did start with the last one first. The question is, when you have desires that are not being met, what do you do? Do you just submerge the desires?

Throughout all of that I had a stronger desire not to break up the house that I had made, the vow that I had made. But that doesn't make the other desire disappear. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause): [00:02:50 00:03:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So some days the answer was to look at it and push away and some days the answer was just to push it away and not look at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Um hmm [yes].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(Pause): [00:03:10 00:03:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I'm not sure how good either of this is. Eventually, it sits there but between the two of them I think the former was better to say, 'this is here. This is not what I'm going to do.' But I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Um hmm [yes].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(Pause): [00:03:48 00:03:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Well, it's especially difficult when there's an assumption that these desires are going to be met and then something completely derails that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">(Pause): [00:04:05 00:04:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and there I feel like were beating someone into the (unclear) who just got lost because these are things I want and then they're we ended up in a very different world, than I feel like we'd set out to be in and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">(Pause): [00:04:43 00:04:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: This is the part where it's hard to hold onto desires that I have that certainly are not possible in the present. I guess in a sense they're similar to the other ones. I desire other things, but I desire, in some sense, to take care of Tanya, more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">(Pause): [00:05:28 00:05:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: The requirements of that have become overwhelming at times and hard to hold onto anything else in sight of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">(Pause): [00:05:44 00:06:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, this is, what I meant to say, all of it. But I do think a piece of it is that you have assumptions of what desires can be met without knowing. Like you have assumptions that you can't be forthcoming and honest about certain feelings you have about the marriage, about what happened, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">that may not be that may not be true that you can't do that. I'm not saying it's definitely not true, but you're making a lot of assumptions that may not be true.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559594\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">(Pause): [00:06:36 00:07:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I mean in this talking about this and that specific desire (Pause), there's a sense which the narrative of the last several years is Tanya was abandoned by her parents and then got into graduate school and felt abandoned by the people who were supposed to be taking care of her in that circumstance. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">And so even the suggestion of I might not be there I'm not sure the assumption of that is a dangerous thing to voice. It's really an invalid one. (Pause) I agree, I am assuming it, but I think I have I don't think that's one that I have constructed entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I'm not at all suggesting that. I'm not at all suggesting that. And I'm not suggesting you might not be right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I'm not suggesting either. I'm just saying that's not a certainty. And maybe I'm even as I'm thinking about it, certainly that's not all. I'm not making the claim that everything that you desire I mean, that you assume that you can't get that you desire, that all might not be true, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">you're just making assumptions. Because there's a lot of desires that have already not been met.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: So, I'm thinking as I chose what to say, maybe I wasn't picking the most essential thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, I think you weren't picking the most essential thing of the specific desire not to be in that marriage while that was happening. I think it is probably an essential feature of other desires, that I do something similar. I actually think that is that. I think that my position is not too <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">far off the mark in that circumstance. When she is suicidal saying, 'I don't want to be with you when you're like this,' is maybe not the thing to say when she has said that I am the only reason she is still alive. I don't really believe that I'm the only reason she is still alive, but she's holding <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">onto telling the story of I am the thing she's holding onto, so to loosen that tie seems dangerous, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">(Pause): [00:10:16 00:10:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: That's not true in most of the other circumstances or all of the other so, I probably am making (Pause) similar assumptions or something like that, that is contributing to my own frustration or something like if -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">(Pause): [00:10:43 00:10:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I had a whole I hadn't remembered this in like 14 years or something. It was just sort of an I think often, I don't know what the context was, but I was in supervision once with a colleague. I was probably like a first or a second year grad student and he was talking about doing this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">assessment with this psychotic I mean, clearly, psychotic I mean, not like upset or something, she had some sort of psychosis and he met with her and the family first and this woman really seemed quite psychotic and off the wall and he met with her individually and she was still psychotic but much, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F2\">much more organized. And the reason that I think that I thought of it and you can be completely right about Tanya, so please, like I'm not saying this is what's going on, but I think there are certain complex, sort of systems where behaviors enabled that might not otherwise happen. Like it could be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F3\">the case, and just could be, please, like don't get me wrong that you know, if you were to say to Tanya, you know, 'actually, this isn't acceptable.' Maybe she'll rise to the task. I don't know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559594\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: You know, that's a really interesting suggestion. She used to self-harm, to cut herself on her legs. I don't know if you knew that or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I didn't know that, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: It's not surprising given the other stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: given the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Right. So that's something I think she'd done when she was in high school, self-injury of some kind, I don't know exactly what. And then it would like come back as things got worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">(Pause): [00:12:24 00:12:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: It is something that I told her about that I did not think was okay but it wasn't I sort of didn't say it that strongly, but anyway she stopped after she visited, which one was it -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">(Pause): [00:12:48 00:12:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Mount Sinai up in Brooklyn. Or Brook-lyn, or however they say it over here. And the reason was one of the psychiatrists really thought something like that was going on to a large extent that like the type of psychotherapy she was doing was enabling her to spiral out of control emotionally, rather <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">than helping her deal with it and so he essentially told her she just wasn't trying hard enough which was not really what she wanted to hear and maybe not helpful in a lot of ways, but I think to spite him, she decided to stop self-injuring. And it hasn't since. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">(Pause): [00:13:40 00:13:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: But you were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: It's an interesting suggestion. I don't know that I could take the risk involved in saying it. Like, 'this is not acceptable.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: What is that risk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: It feels like the risk is of pushing her over the edge. Saying, 'this is not acceptable,' in a time when she's (Pause): [00:14:14 00:14:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: In a time when she's in a sense, out of control, or emotionally out of control. She -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: But here's a Catch-22. Part of the reason she's out of control is she's not being held accountable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">(Pause): [00:14:43 00:16:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: It looks like you've gone somewhere very deep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Well, that's a pretty deep suggestion, isn't it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: The first thought that came to mind is so the five year old she's watching a few weeks ago, started her morning by doing something deliberately that she had told him not to do. He'd kicked his sister and then she said, 'don't kick your sister.' So he'd look at her, kick his sister and then looks <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">back at her like, 'what are you going to do?' So she sent him to his room and the rest of the day he'd be fine. So it seems like (Pause) he was in a sense, asking to be held accountable and I mean by being held accountable, everything was okay. So, certainly I just told you about the self-injury, I guess I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">(Pause): [00:18:01 00:18:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: It's plausible. I don't know whether it's, I don't know. But I'm not certain as to who's supposed to hold her accountable? It's not a question I guess. Of course my first answer is, 'me.' I guess that's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">(Pause): [00:18:56 00:19:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Your first answer is you.

Because I started to think as we are talking about this topic, I actually think it's really important, I thought diverging from what you were saying which is about you and your desires and the compromises that you've had to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">make maybe too many compromises so this there's the issue of holding her accountable for her own good for her good. And there's holding her accountable because it's what you need holding her accountable because you need a partner in marriage. And so when you said, 'who else?' it sounded like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB2\">it was more because it was your responsibility to hold her accountable because you have to take care of her. Which, I mean, I'm not saying that's not true, but then what gets lost is you need to hold her accountable because you need a partner who can be accountable because that's what you need in a marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">(Pause): [00:22:57 00:23:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I do think not being held accountable is a destructive thing in life in general. I started thinking about the story of her brother, about the graduation, of how he didn't seem like he was held accountable on any level even to the extent that his parents would check in with him, would be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">'how are you doing your classes? Are you actually getting -?' He could lie. I'm not saying he wouldn't lie. But there's a lack of accountability there which seems like instead of being accommodating, but in the end being extremely neglectful of your son who clearly needed their help and needed their <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">input and needed to be held accountable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">(Pause): [00:23:42 00:24:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, he sort of changed life plans in December and Jonah wanted to (unclear) by boat and no one said, 'what's wrong with you?' That's not a reasonable life plan. So, yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">(Pause): [00:24:14 00:24:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: So I guess one of the things I'm thinking is that I'm kind of thinking out loud, is your feeling of what she needs and what you need as sort of conflicting isn't necessarily true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">(Pause): [00:24:31 00:25:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: So on the other hand if she had cancer, it would not be reasonable to look at her and say, 'this is not acceptable. You cannot have cancer.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: But it would be reasonable if she avoided treatment of it. The cancer isn't she can't but if she did have something that actually hastened her death with the cancer, or neglect her care, that you can hold her accountable to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559594\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">(Pause): [00:25:45 00:25:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Absolutely, So the line is clearer there than it is in the mental health case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Well, it's tricky because if the illness is not holding oneself accountable, how can expectation about being accountable that's part of the illness in a sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">(Pause): [00:26:14 00:26:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: And so it becomes more complicated I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">(Pause): [00:26:20 00:26:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: But certainly the solution is not avoiding that issue and I know you're not because I mean, we're talking about it.

I mean, for some people I mean their <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">alcoholics. I mean it's in their I don't think this is true of everyone who has an alcohol problem.

It may have been possible, but no I'm not making that I'm making a statement in the here and now because that has been going along with your logic that somehow you had some responsibility in creating this. Even from a moral standpoint, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">I couldn't possibly take that position. I don't think it's your responsibility. Would it have helped? I don't know. I really don't.

And some of them having been thwarted, I have lost track of them also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">(Pause): [00:39:13 00:39:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Probably one of the more important ones is having a partner that you can rely on now in going forward and having some sense of security and trust that she'll be there for you. And you know, her mental illness aside, which is (unclear) you want to feel that she can be accountable to herself <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D1\">with all of her vulnerabilities and accountable to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: And there is also there's some sense that there's nothing I can do about that like I can hold her accountable, but what will I do if she fails? I guess I don't see sometimes I don't see a meaningful way to hold her accountable if I'm not going to leave and I'm not going to leave, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F1\">(Pause) I'm not saying, 'oh, you didn't get milk. I'm out the door,' is a likely or reasonable response, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: That's an interesting way of thinking about it. Because what you're saying is that there is no consequence had you held her accountable. If there's no sending her to her room after she's kicked her sister, what's the point? But that's interesting in itself that the only way that that accountability <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201711\">is meaningful is if there's a consequence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">(Pause): [00:40:59 00:41:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm not sure I think that's true. It's just that it's clearer when there's a consequence that accountability has happened. I think that maybe part of why we have the criminal justice system we have, which is clearly problematic, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">(Pause): [00:41:27 00:41:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: So for a child, the consequence is the accountability I think. Or something like it. It's the physical manifestation of the accountability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Well, then a consequence like you're going to your room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Is there accountability without consequence? Is that even a meaningful thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Well, that's what yeah, I guess that's the question we're looking at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: This is sort of going out on a limb a little bit so I really don't know if I believe this, but I do wonder, like 10'% of me, 5% of me wonders that if you held Tanya accountable and she failed, whether you'd be more open to consequences. You don't even get there. You're not even going there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">(Pause): 00:42:38 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">THERAPIST: That it's simply to say that you actually might feel differently if you whatever this looks like and then it didn't happen you might feel differently than you do now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">(Pause): [00:42:56 00:43:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: I think part of this is that this is not the kind of relationship that I thought I was entering into so I know how to hold people accountable. I can do that, but I ran the fencing team for several years. I held them accountable, made them practice. I mean like but if -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2018A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559594\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">(Pause): [00:44:02 00:44:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: But I was elected to be in charge of the fencing team. Am I in charge of my marriage? Like am I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">(Pause): [00:44:25 00:44:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">THERAPIST: Maybe we're talking about different kinds of accountability not that you and I are thinking about different but maybe if we think about it as different kinds of accountability, because when I brought up Tanya's brother, the accountability that a son to parents has, you know, that kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201931\">of relationship is different than in a marriage. I would argue that every marriage has, you know, two people are holding each other accountable, like always, like that's part of a marriage. What's different about your marriage is that doesn't feel implicit right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">(Pause): [00:45:17 00:45:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">THERAPIST: Maybe that's a way of looking at it. But I think you were but I understand what you were talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">CLIENT: Okay. And I'm not upset. I'm very interested in this line of discussion because I think it's getting at something very fundamental.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">(Pause): [00:45:46 00:45:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: There's something that I don't want to have to hold Tanya accountable to for her vows. Does that make sense like I feel like those are I am accountable and responsible for my vows but that is a thing that I should be doing, like maintaining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess we're going to need to stop here. These are, you know I was thinking like we needed to analogize the Brown students like the Brown students might be paying their taxes. They should, but they're not. So what do you do? Do they not pay their taxes or do you come to them, 'look, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F1\">you need to pay your taxes.' So I don't know if that's a perfect analogy, but if people aren't doing that then what do you do? And what you're saying is you didn't sign up for the, 'then what do you do?' But that's the position you're in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">CLIENT: Right. I didn't intentionally sign up for it, but it's yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">THERAPIST: We're going to stop on that note. So I will see you next week.
