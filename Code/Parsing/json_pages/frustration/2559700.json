I\u2019m saving all the e-mails. I\u2019m taking these all to court. The inconsistencies and the stuff she says . . .

I know she\u2019s fucking crazy and she\u2019s not going to cut me a check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">Within an hour, she changed. She\u2019s like, Elaine \u2013 the other trustee \u2013 is like, \u201cI gave you\u2014you have my money to send him.\u201d So, I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, if you could send me Elaine\u2019s money, that would minimize your finance charges and collection (inaudible at 00:29:42).\u201d Which is true, and it\u2019s close to $2,000. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201A71\">I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">Thinking that, oh, this would be some sort of . . . at least trying to pay it. But she started arguing about it.  The, \u201cYou never gave me the money.\u201d \u201cElaine has the money.\u201d \u201cYou have the money.\u201d They\u2019re arguing over (ph) who has the money and who gave\u2014they\u2019re arguing over not whether someone should <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201A91\">write the check but whether this whole, just, pointless, \u201cWhat instructions did you give me?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t instruct me.\u201d (inaudible at 00:30:18) Well, now I\u2019m instructing you: do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">And Elaine won\u2019t respond with that. She plays into this, \u201cOh, I told her.\u201d \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t tell me, I told Cameron that,\u201d just\u2014okay, I\u2019m telling you now, send the fucking check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD\">So, I\u2019m probably just going to wait another two weeks and I\u2019ll file small claims. So, that guy may just shoot an e-mail today. And I wanted to explain to\u2014I tried to explain to her that my judgment, whether she likes it or not, whether she agrees that she owes the money or not, is going to cover her <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD1\">evening, so . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559700\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: That means she\u2019s got a cloud on her title.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: Until she pays off the judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: So, she can\u2019t refinance or sell without paying off the entire judgment. None of them would be able to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: And judgment (crosstalk at 00:31:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: Even if I get Elaine\u2019s portion, there\u2019s no way for me to not have it apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Right. So, that (ph) the judgment is (ph) small claims<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT: Right. Usually, in a trust situation, the beneficiaries are not liable for the trust. But in this situation, the beneficiaries are the trust. All three are trustees. All three are the only beneficiaries. They\u2019re so closely related that they are the trust, so, they\u2019re ultimately that\u2019s the case <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C11\">I\u2019m going to make, that they\u2019re liable. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some case law up there, too, for condos, to get them individually liable for the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">I may decide to take it to district court for that reason. I\u2019ll leave it up to some magistrate to look in his gut and feel whether it\u2019s right or not, so it may be worth taking it to district court. Problem is, in district court, I\u2019m probably going to get a counter-claim for malpractice. That judgment <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C31\">for $20,000 was really incompetence. Desperation on my part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Wait, what do you mean the judgment for\u2014the judgment against them in small claims court for $20,000?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT: When I got summary judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Oh, you mean that way the case\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">THERAPIST: it sounds like, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">CLIENT: You got to suffer damages for there to be malpractice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">THERAPIST: I see. You mean you won.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yes.  [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">THERAPIST: [laughs] Yeah, I remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s hard for them to sue for malpractice if you\u2019ve won.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">CLIENT: Right, right. And even if I\u2014you still have to suffer some damage. You\u2019ve got to be missing something, something you didn\u2019t have before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Right, your problem has to\u2014your malpractice has its cost of trouble (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E1\">THERAPIST: I mean, sometimes you lose, sometimes you lose and (inaudible at 00:33:21) that cost them damage. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E3\">CLIENT: And also, when the counter-claim comes, the question is do I want to go [to find] (ph) my insurance company and have them do the lawsuit? I don\u2019t know. So . . . Which is another reason just to keep it in small claims and take what I can get. Even a judgment against the condo association is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201E31\">to cloud their title. So . . .

This is what I deal with when I deal with these tenants and the pro bono, lawyer-of-the-day stuff.  I really just start spitting out all this information on a single <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201EB1\">case. Let\u2019s focus on (inaudible at 00:35:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201ED\">THERAPIST: [I see] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EF\">CLIENT: The conversation you and your landlord had, where you disagreed on whether Obama was a Muslim or not a Muslim really doesn\u2019t play into the fact that you owe $3,000 in rent and you were evicted or you were terminated, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F1\">So, this will be the same thing. She\u2019s just going to start blah, blah, blah, blah. And the magistrates are a little better than I. They know how to handle this stuff, so . . . They deal with it all the time. They won\u2019t just let you go. They got a lot of cases to get through.

On one hand, she says I don\u2019t represent the condo. I represent them individually. But then she blames me for not\u2014for allowing the condo to fall into disrepair. So, which is it? Do I represent them individually?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">I went and checked my old e-mails.

I didn\u2019t mean so much the crazy part as the part where you\u2019re in a situation with somebody else, feeling like you really don\u2019t have a leg to stand on, feeling like you can bluster or whatever, but you\u2019re ultimately wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">CLIENT: Even when you\u2019re not.

[0:39:00] So, it\u2019ll be interesting what the bar council does if she file a complaint. Because I had another bar where they filed a complaint against me that I had his escrow money.

The lender fees, interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021B\">So . . . But that\u2019s not a\u2014they don\u2019t consider that a complaint.
