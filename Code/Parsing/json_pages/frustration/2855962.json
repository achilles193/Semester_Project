You don\u2019t say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Thank the lord Heath paid for her trip up here. She comes up with one big suitcase, a backpack, so we decided we\u2019re going to open up the big suitcase. There\u2019s nothing in it but another suitcase, another small carry-on one that had her clothes in it. So I guess the hint was\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Stock us up, restock us with clothes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: She came with a package of new underwear, a package of socks, a couple pairs of shitty shoes that had seen their last day, some bras, maybe three pairs of socks and a couple of tops.  That was it. And her makeup and stuff. So I says well, I guess that means Nana\u2019s filling up the suitcase, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">she tells me she doesn\u2019t plan on going home, and she doesn\u2019t plan on going back to her grandmother\u2019s, with Margie. She wants to stay where she is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Has she turned 16 yet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. She\u2019ll be 17 in August.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Is she emancipated at 17?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: 16 you can do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: At 17 does she even need to do that, or does she still need to sign\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: She\u2019ll need to sign. She just went and got her birth certificate. Deborah says, \u201cOh, we\u2019ve got to go to Hingham and get her birth certificate.\u201d Because she was born in Hingham. I says, no you don\u2019t. You just go up to Medford City Hall. It\u2019s there. \u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d I says, Deborah, I was born in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">Falmouth. I went there and got my birth certificate. Your brother was born in Revere. I said, we got his birth certificate from Cheshire. I says, so go ahead. So she just called me and said they picked it up. Let\u2019s see. Sunday she went \u2013 no, Saturday she went to Peabody Oaks. From Peabody Oaks she went <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">to play miniature golf in Boxford, and from there they went to Winthrop to the (inaudible) for something to eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re paying the tab? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Well the kid upstairs, Jim, took them, and he paid for some, but I only gave her 60 bucks, but that was gone. They went to the movies together in the movie theater. Supposedly it\u2019s fantastic. They have seats you can really recline in, and she says it\u2019s almost like being in a bed, that\u2019s how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">they recline, how far they are. I say, okay, that\u2019s good. That cost me another $50.00. This was $33.00 for the tickets alone because it was in 3D, then a tonic and a cup of corn, then of course putting money on the card, costing me 10, 15.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Last night they took the bus to Naomi\u2019s house.  Then she went and saw Naomi, and Naomi drove them home. They just took the bus to City Hall and walked from there to Naomi\u2019s house, and tonight they want pizza. Darla wants pizza with pepperoni and black olives. I go, I don\u2019t do black olives, so why don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">you just get a large (inaudible) pizza for you and Darla, and I\u2019ll get a small cheese one myself. Darla says, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the mozzarella sticks, and the chicken wings.\u201d (inaudible) Darla, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: A side of Darla.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Friday night they\u2019re going into Providence to see all the lights and walk around, and everything, her, Naomi, and Deborah.  Saturday night she\u2019s going to the lake. Kid upstairs, Jim, is taking them. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing Sunday. God only knows. Then the following weekend is the July <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">4th weekend. We\u2019re going to something up in Falmouth that (inaudible) puts on for the seniors. I get a free hotdog, and bag of chips, and a drink, because I\u2019s a senior citizen, but they have music, and all kinds of things, activities going on, fireworks, but then they\u2019re going into Providence to see <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">the fireworks in \u2013 I don\u2019t know, is it Saturday night they do that?

She went to Naomi\u2019s and she came home, and she was starving, so this time she wanted four meatballs, a sausage, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">and macaroni. I don\u2019t know where she puts it.  Do not know where she puts it. She\u2019s 5\u20195. Deborah\u2019s 5\u20194, and I\u2019m 5\u20193. So okay.

Where is she going to \u2013 you know? Mind you I went out and bought a queen-sized inflatable mattress that she sleeps on, and it\u2019s in my living room. You\u2019ve got to blow it up every night, take it down every morning.  It\u2019s a pin in the ass.

The damn thing weighs a ton. She folds it this way, and that way, then throws it on my bed. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">up nights. I take it from my room, carry it into the parlor, which I\u2019m not supposed to be doing, unfolding it and plugging it in so it inflates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Who do I have for company? Nobody anymore. I haven\u2019t heard from Artie in three weeks. I called him for Father\u2019s Day and wished him a happy Father\u2019s Day, but he didn\u2019t answer, so I left a message. Same for his birthday, didn\u2019t answer. I just said Happy Birthday and that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">that. I haven\u2019t bothered him at all. I think when I left a message on his birthday, I said let\u2019s remember this. It takes two to get into an argument, Artie. So I says, I\u2019m not to blame for everything, you know?  I said, you did mostly a very good part of it, you know? Then that was that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah, he\u2019s at least temporarily upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: He\u2019s out of the picture, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Yeah. Well how do you feel about taking it all on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t mind because she\u2019s the type of kid that every parent would want, really, you know? She does love school. The work for her seems to come like a breeze.  She really doesn\u2019t \u2013 well here she doesn\u2019t do much of anything because she doesn\u2019t know any kids from here. If she knew other kids, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">it would be fine. Even Sue\u2019s son, Lee, was trying to put the make on her. I said, Lee, she\u2019s 16. You\u2019re 32. Don\u2019t even think it. \u201cWell I can introduce her to my friends.\u201d I said no, because they\u2019re just as old as you, and they\u2019re junkies just like you. No. Texted me the other day, \u201cDo you know where <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200892\">I can get any colonicans (sp)?\u201d I said, no, why don\u2019t you ask your mother? She\u2019s the one that takes them, you know? I said, Darla don\u2019t fall far from the tree, believe me.  Then Darla saw in our hallway Susan and him interact with each other, and she says, \u201cI think that\u2019s a little odd.\u201d I says, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: So they came over and they were kind of\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What you had seen, you just got lost on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: She said, \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you two to go. Bye.\u201d (laughter) Yeah, they left. I said, they are a sick group, you know? I said, it can\u2019t be on the Ashton side, must be the Skellen (sp) side, which is her mother. I said, because that\u2019s not normal.  I don\u2019t know if when she was doing that she <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">did it to make up for not being in his life, because of the way he was brought up by his father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Probably guilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, she\u2019d take him up skiing, take him to Disneyland, really overdo it, because she was making up for not being there. So he was a kid to think that everything should be his, like Deborah. Susan\u2019s money is his money.

I know my mother had me tied in the driveway, and my uncle drove in the driveway and ran over me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: Had you what in the driveway?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: Tied, when I was young. There was no fence, no nothing, so she had a long rope on me, and my Uncle Conrad decided to back up, didn\u2019t know I was there, ran over me. I wound up in the hospital for that, for having skin abrasions on my back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: After he had run over?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Or hit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: Hit. We didn\u2019t stay in that neighborhood for\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: What? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: My mother decided it was time to move into another apartment at that time. I tell you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: Hearing you talk about your childhood and all the kind of violent and all the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: Never a dull moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">THERAPIST: What is it like to hear it though, think about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">CLIENT: I think it was really whacked out, but what the hell? That\u2019s the way they \u2013 I guess we lived like that. One big whacked out family. My mother still had Mary and Jonas living with us because every time my aunt and her decided to get sloshed, Uncle Conrad would drop them off at our house.  So <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201691\">it would be me, and Mary, and Mickie, and Billy. The latest thing on that is with Darla staying with her grandmother, Margie, one of his brother\u2019s, Bobby, has two kids \u2013 well, he has three. The boy is 11 and I think the girl is 13 or something. Well the married brother Willie, and his wife Savannah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201692\">have had custody of them ever since they were little. Well now Savannah doesn\u2019t want custody of them anymore. So now they\u2019re going down to Nana Margie\u2019s house to live. I said, where\u2019s Nana Margie going to put them? There\u2019s only one bedroom, and she can\u2019t put the two of them in the same bedroom, Darla. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201693\">Let\u2019s face it. They\u2019re too old to be in the same bedroom. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855962\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">That means that one of them will have to \u2013 the girl will have to go in the bedroom with you and share it. Darla says, \u201cI\u2019m not sharing my room with anybody.\u201d I said, I don\u2019t know what your Nana Margie\u2019s going to do. She says, \u201cNow you know why I don\u2019t want to go back there.\u201d I says, at your father\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B1\">house, you have your own room. \u201cI\u2019m not going back there either.\u201d I guess Heath finally agreed to get her counseling. That\u2019s a start when she gets home. She\u2019s all, \u201cWhy should I start there? I might as well just start here and stay here.\u201d The kid\u2019s got the answers to everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s got a plan. She wants to stay. She doesn\u2019t want to go back, (inaudible). Is it that she wants to stay with her mom? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: Or with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: Mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">THERAPIST: Mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">CLIENT: I said, Darla, how do you expect your mother to afford to support you? She says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I says, y you\u2019ve got to think all these things out, Darla.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a good question to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">CLIENT: Does your father get insurance for you or whatever\u2019s available for you down there? \u201cNo.\u201d I says, does he collect any money for you down there? \u201cNo.\u201d I says, why are they charging Deborah for support when he\u2019s not getting any, or from the State, or nothing? Deborah said to her, \u201cTell your father <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B1\">to write a note saying he gets no support for you and all this, so I can apply for health insurance for you up here, so you\u2019ll have insurance.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Would she know if she\u2019s insured?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">THERAPIST: You might want to check with Kenny to see if he signed her up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">CLIENT: I think Deborah thinks if she does that she can get support for Darla from MassHealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s insurance though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">CLIENT: I think she\u2019s thinking she can get a check from them for\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think from insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Maybe from the State.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I said, I don\u2019t know. You better find out all these things, Deborah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Who knows? There\u2019s probably some support. I think it would be more likely though that Deborah would have to enroll for some support in some way, rather than it be Darla. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: You claim you have a dependent, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to send a check to Deborah. I mean to Darla, instead of to Deborah. She would have to also establish residency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: She would have to get housing too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: But that might be a way for her to kind of \u2013 if she does pursue that, she would have to get involved with the system and get some help through them. I can\u2019t \u2013 I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Could she say her residency is at your place, or would that raise a red flag for you? In other words would they\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: She\u2019s supposed to be supposedly homeless. The only thing she gets is her mail delivered to my place, and she might come by every now and again to pick it up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: I got it. She\u2019s technically homeless?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Our neighbor is making threatening threats against Deborah, which is\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the one from upstairs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: They had the relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the (inaudible)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. She came knocking at my door the other day, a few weeks ago. She says, \u201cIs Deborah home?\u201d I says, no, she\u2019s around in the building somewhere, but I don\u2019t know where. \u201cWell you tell her I\u2019m sick and tired of her shit. She\u2019s spreading rumors about me and I\u2019m sick of it. She\u2019s out <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB1\">of here. She doesn\u2019t even belong living here.\u201d As she\u2019s walking down the hall, \u201cShe\u2019s out of here. She\u2019s out of here.

What did you think of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: Alice\u2019s whacked, you know? She sent Deborah a letter with a little envelope of marijuana in it, and thanking her so much for taking care of her cat, because the people who owned the cat were visiting Alice, and saw what care the cat was getting, and all this shit. So I guess Deborah showed the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF1\">letter to a few people, and that was it. Who knows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Oh, that was the rumor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Of course Kelly and I had another big fight. It\u2019s a fucking jungle there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it. What happened between you and Kelly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">CLIENT: These new people that moved in last year, the woman\u2019s name is Petra. The husband\u2019s name is Javier, something.  Well Petra has such a loud mouth on her that you can hear it no matter where you are in the building. I guess she was yelling at this girl Pat \u2013 she\u2019s not a girl. She\u2019s like, 55, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B71\">she\u2019s slow. She got hit by a car when she was little, and had brain damage, and lost a kidney, and all this shit, and she is a little slow, and Petra was calling her a fucking idiot, and a fucking retard, and fucking this, and fucking that. Well Kelly went and told Alice she called Alice a retard and an idiot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B9\">Again, she would report her to housing. I guess she got called into housing on Monday, and it wasn\u2019t because Alice called. It was other residents that called into the building of her foul language.  I guess she was saying something about Kelly and her son being in jail, and Kelly goes, \u201cThe only one <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B91\">that knew my son was in jail was you and Deborah.\u201d I says, you don\u2019t think people can\u2019t Google your name and anything like that and see that come up about your son? I said, give me a break, Kelly. I never said nothing, and Deborah never said a damn thing. I said, believe what you want to believe, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B92\">is always natural, you know? So what the hell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Well you say it\u2019s a jungle, really captures the way it can feel and maybe you talking about your childhood in some ways, how it\u2019s always felt this sort of sense of things can really get explosive fast, and relationships can get like, destroyed quickly. People get hurt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. \u201cI never called a (inaudible). You know why I don\u2019t like him, because he\u2019s cheating on his wife and he\u2019s using you.\u201d I says, you think I don\u2019t know that? I says, like I tell Deborah, it\u2019s my money. I\u2019ll do what I want to do with it. She has a roof over her head. She has food on the fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD1\">table, and she has clothes on her back, so what she\u2019s bitching about, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">THERAPIST: You mean she was bitching to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">CLIENT: To Kelly \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">THERAPIST: About you and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">CLIENT: (inaudible).
