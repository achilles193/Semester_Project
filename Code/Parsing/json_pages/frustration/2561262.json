And I wonder if some of this is because it reminds you of your mom\u2019s behavior. Because your mom had a before and an after before drugs and after drugs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And who you were that\u2026 tell me what you\u2019re feeling.

(pause) I think\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Growing up, I think that I spent a lot of times telling them, \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d And when we have our kids, we\u2019re not going to do our children like how we were done. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C31\">then I look at my sister, I\u2019m like she\u2019s smoking week with her daughter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So that makes you feel what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: Ooh, like God. This girl in school, I mean, book smart. A\u2019s, has scholarships and stuff. And now I\u2019m looking at her, I\u2019m like, OK, she\u2019s not working. (crying) She\u2019s very lazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: You feel like she threw it all away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yea, very lazy. She likes to drink. But she\u2019s not violent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: She just likes to drink and I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s not ladylike.

But I want to be a lady.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like you have higher expectations for her than she has for herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And I also wonder if a part of you is not looking like, do you see what this did to our mother and us?

And then if you mix some weed with the drinking and it\u2019s not what you want.\u201d (crying) I said, \u201cWhat if you get weed from somebody and it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB1\">all weed?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause this is what happened to our mother.

You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll get. And then I tell them, I said, \u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d OK, I think all three of my sisters smoke weed. My baby sister, though, I don\u2019t think she does it on a regular. And she\u2019s a very good mom. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E32\">a good wife. Everything.

And my baby sister is more so like me with the exception of that she smokes. And my\u2026 the two middle sisters, they smoke on a regular. The third sister, she\u2019s more inclined to work and she will work. She wants her own. Right now she\u2019s a little down and out and so she moved in with my sister, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">the one that I was\u2026 the one next to me with the daughter\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: \u2026to help her out.

So the models in our life, we mimic what they see, right? And sometimes even though you might have one shiny example like you, when you\u2019re surrounded by other models that are not doing what\u2026 doing productive things, you are in some ways pulled down <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201591\">by your environment, right? And it didn\u2019t start with you. It started with your parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">THERAPIST: And this isn\u2019t to point the finger at them. I mean, there are some very painful reasons people use, right to numb pain, to do all kinds of things. That\u2019s what has happened to some of your sisters.

So every year the two middle sisters, they made it a point to say, well, we\u2019re going to make it a tradition that every year on her birthday we cook dinner.  And all the sisters <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F1\">get together and we just sit around and enjoy what mom could\u2019ve enjoyed, right? And I said, OK, that\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">So the third sister called me and she said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re thinking about going to the cemetery to see mom. Go visit and visit grandma.\u201d And they wanted to know if I wanted to go. And I immediate told them no. And I haven\u2019t been to a cemetery.

And then now my mom is there and then my grandma is there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D1\">Then there\u2019s a headstone space for my granddad and everything.

I said, \u201cBecause everybody is there.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd there\u2019s so many.

And I think the reason why is because I\u2019ve remembered my grandmother. I remember being a kid and it was Memorial Day. And I knew what Memorial Day stood for. And I said, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cGrandma, are we going to cemetery and see Uncle Larry?\u201d Because he was 19 when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D1\">he passed away and it was by accident and stuff then I was so close to him.

I said, \u201cWell, I got all the flowers we need.\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go stealing people\u2019s flowers out of their yard.\u201d And I said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t steal them.

I\u2019ve seen them in a casket. I know that they\u2019re buried.

I always ask myself that and I try to figure it out. And I say because I want to be at peace. I don\u2019t want to walk around and feel like\u2026 and I\u2019m going to tell you why I feel like that. I feel like now I could be washing dishes and I could feel like I see a shadow <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB1\">walk past me. And at first, it used to scare me.

So I\u2019m feeling good and everything. Now I\u2019m the only one in this car and I\u2019m going to pick up my baby sister who\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB1\">to keep my kids for me, right? And I had my music going. There was no traffic at all. It was unbelievable that there was no traffic really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Yea, because in Milwaukee it doesn\u2019t happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yea. And then the time was like maybe 7 or 8 o\u2019clock in the evening. And then I hear this little voice and I hear it and it\u2019s so clear. And it whispered like it was just so soft. And it just said, \u201cGet off at the exit.\u201d And I was like, \u201cGet off at the exit?\u201d It\u2019s like it was just sitting next <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF1\">to me.

Why would I get off at the exit? That\u2019s the long way around. There\u2019s no traffic. I said, shoot. I ain\u2019t getting off at the exit. And I cut my music all the way up and guess what?

(chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20223\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2026 I\u2019m thinking a couple things as you\u2019re telling me this very powerful story. One that I think, at least and this is my own personal belief that the spirit world and the physical world are not that disconnected, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20225\">CLIENT: You don\u2019t think so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20227\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think so because I think I have felt the presence of my father. I think that\u2026 and this is all going to depend on what you believe. But when people physically depart from the Earth, they live within you, right, which is why their physical loss is so painful. But depending on how you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202271\">feel about the person, their emotional loss, they may still be with you. And it sounds like you feel that in a very powerful way, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20229\">And I mean, religious\u2026 religion, one way of defining is people who sort of attend church or a particular religious service a mosque, the synagogue, whatever on a consistent basis.  But religion can envelope a sense of spirituality or it can be some of the things you describe for yourself a belief <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202291\">in God, a belief in spirit, a belief in things more powerful than yourself. And you\u2019ve presented yourself as a very spiritual person.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20228-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20228-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561262\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022B\">CLIENT: Yea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think, for you, if attending church is that\u2026 if that\u2019s not for you or where you find God, OK.

I was wondering that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">THERAPIST: And this is just\u2026 I should confess. I\u2019m not a regular church attendee myself.

You don\u2019t\u2026 may not always know or be able to acknowledge that you\u2019re doing that, but you very clearly follow <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202551\">your own voice.

I think they do. You know why I say that? My sister, the one I told you that\u2019s next to me, the one with the daughter, this is the way she is and I\u2019m kind of noticing it now that if she feels an obligation to something, she\u2019ll do it.  But if she feels no obligation, nah, no interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027D\">THERAPIST: It does make me wonder, when do you get to focus on your own voice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027F\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20281\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t. I don\u2019t mean leave your family behind. I don\u2019t mean that at all, right? But at a certain point in time, you get to focus on your own voice. Like this is your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20283\">CLIENT: Yes. And I am so enjoying it. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20285\">THERAPIST: I know. But how do you enjoy finding your own voice? And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really that lost from it. It\u2019s just about clarity because you\u2019re pretty consistent in who you are and what you want, right? But it\u2019s about, in some ways, accepting and this is a somewhat painful but accepting <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202851\">your sisters are making choice that they are allowed to make given that everybody is grown.  And your choices are different. And you can\u2019t always relate which is why when they were passing bud around the room, everyone was like, uh-oh, guess who\u2019s here, right? Because they\u2019re choices are different than your choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20287\">CLIENT: And I have\u2026 (chuckling) It\u2019s really kind of funny. Some of my neighbors, they call me Ms. Yvette and they\u2019re the same age I am. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20289\">THERAPIST: What do you make of that, Ms. Yvette?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028B\">CLIENT: Yea. And I\u2019m like, so should I dye my hair now? (chuckling) Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028D\">THERAPIST: Well, and so what does that tell you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028F\">CLIENT: That I act like an old lady. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20291\">THERAPIST: Well, but you know what? In some ways, you\u2019ve been forced to be everybody\u2019s momma. And you\u2019ve taken on the role. And so when your siblings make choices that you see as detrimental to them, it does hurt you. Of course it does. But they are allowed to make their choices just like you\u2019re allowed <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202911\">to focus on your own voice.  So what are we saying forty?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20293\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20295\">THERAPIST: Hey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20297\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20299\">THERAPIST: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029D\">THERAPIST: And so your sons are how old?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029F\">CLIENT: Twenty-three and nineteen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. And so it doesn\u2019t involve leaving your family behind but it does involve shifting your concentration because at a certain point in time, they get to be responsible for their choices. You choose to lead by example. You\u2019ve given them the example. They have to choose to do something <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202A11\">with it and they\u2019re making all kinds of choices some of them good, some of them bad. Just like you and I, right? So when do you get to focus on your own voice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A3\">CLIENT: Well, I would say late at night but by then I\u2019m tired. And I am so exhausted. But it\u2019s like I ask myself. I said when did I have time to write that book? And then I said when did I have time to put together that little portfolio? [0:38:05] And do you know, I still can\u2019t remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A5\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A7\">CLIENT: I cannot. I don\u2019t know when. And then like the other day I was washing dishes. I don\u2019t know. It always seems like when I\u2019m washing dishes I guess I go onto thinking mode or something. And I\u2019m washing dishes and I said, ooh, perfect title for another book for a kid. Oh, (inaudible at 00:38:23). <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202A71\">I\u2019m going to do that.
