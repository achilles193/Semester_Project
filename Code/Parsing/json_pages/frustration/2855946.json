As long as I can stay and work -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: And did you talk to the temp agency guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yes, I\u2019ve talked to temp agencies as I had submitted before. So I met with one of them on Thursday and the guy seemed very intense. And apparently they have a very small pool. They don\u2019t call people in unless they think they can place them. And the other thing is once you say you\u2019re ready to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">work he expects you to be ready to work even the morning of, which I\u2019m thinking this is kind of scary. The day before I understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: That felt like too much of a commitment for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes. I mean I\u2019m okay with getting something and saying okay this is a two-months thing, come in every day. Just I guess I just want to live as though I have something and therefore can\u2019t schedule appointments during the daytime anymore. So I told him I\u2019d be able to start this coming Thursday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">since I have appointments well today, tomorrow and Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Or you just know that you might need to cancel things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yes. Well the other problem is just I have one professional [inaudible at 00:02:04] right now that fits, for certain definitions it fits and it doesn\u2019t even fit that well. It\u2019s the one that I use when I talk to the temp agency people. I went to Macys today since the other place I talked to they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">only have sporadic temp work so the woman there said yes you should be with multiple agencies. So I think I\u2019m more likely to get placed by the first place. But when I went afterwards, Macys was at the downtown crossing station, and I found a suit that fits. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: And do you need a suit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I need a suit for interviews; I don\u2019t need a suit for temp stuff. But I\u2019m hoping that if I apply enough I think I\u2019ll at least get some interviews. I still have to get it tailored. But then an hour of looking after I found the suit and I could not find a single shirt that was business casual <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">looking. They were all looking like okay we\u2019re going on summer vacation or going clubbing or I guess those would be the two extremes but I couldn\u2019t find anything. There were ones that might have worked but then they had tank top sleeves and I thought that\u2019s not very professional looking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And I\u2019ve already on Wednesday I went searching the second hand store and couldn\u2019t find anything. And then went to The Gap and couldn\u2019t find anything and now I\u2019m just I found a shirt on Amazon that I think will work that comes in multiple colors so I ordered on to see if it\u2019ll fit but I have to wait <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">until I ordered it on Sunday and I\u2019ll get it on Tuesday and then I\u2019ll have two shirts if it does fit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">But I\u2019m thinking how the hell am I going to get myself professionally attired? And I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m that picky in terms of style. They just all didn\u2019t seem like something that would fit in a business environment. I don\u2019t know where to get those types of clothes especially since now I\u2019m a shirt <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">size larger, extra large and, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yes it could be tricky to find a store that meets your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yes. I guess I could always try Target and tomorrow the only thing I have on is the we have couples counseling at 10:00 in the morning. Yes, I can\u2019t start working until I have things that I can wear to work. And I\u2019m just really frustrated that this is as hard as they\u2019re making it out to be. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">Do they just not expect women to work in the fashion industry? They say oh they\u2019re clearly all supported by their husbands and go out all the time and party and therefore don\u2019t need business-looking clothes? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I doubt that that\u2019s the case. There\u2019s plenty of women working and wearing clothes as they do it. But it might be that you\u2019re having trouble finding the right style for you that feels comfortable and fits in where you\u2019re looking. Have you talked to some friends? Where do they shop? Does anybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">work in an office setting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know and they\u2019re, most of my friends would be a lot smaller than me and I\u2019m larger size so I haven\u2019t I guess I could ask. I don\u2019t even know what size I am any more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Oh. So maybe that\u2019s the place to start is to honestly go and figure out what size really fits you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes. I mean if I had found things that looked like they would plausibly worked I would have tried them on like I did with the suit. And I\u2019m really confused now because the pants that I got for the suit, I figured the pants that I used to wear around most of the time were size 16 and they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">getting very tight and stuff. So I assumed that when I gained all the weight I was probably sized 20 or something or 22. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">And I tried on a 22 and it was super big. And I said okay let me try an 18 and the 18 fit. So I think okay does that make me a size 18? And the shirt, the top, the blazer part of the suit was a 14. Am I large and not an extra large but my business shirt that I wore this morning and changed out of was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">a large. It was not sitting properly and so I thought maybe I am an extra large.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Well different you may not be exactly the same size for tops as bottoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Well [inaudible at 00:06:55] knows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Human beings are not necessarily uniform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And different styles and different makers sizing is not necessarily consistent across brands. So it is, which I know might be frustrating but trying on lots of different things. And maybe looking at some of the stores that are more specifically geared towards larger sizes because you might <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">find more variety there that feels comfortable for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes. If I find a long shirt that fits and it comes in a bunch of colors, I just buy it in a bunch of colors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yes, sure. That\u2019s a great way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I did with the last round of business casual clothes. But at least I have a suit now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yes you made a good accomplishment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Because I was afraid I was going to be a giant size or something or they weren\u2019t going to have it. And then Macys has this size 14 to 24 section so I was able to find stuff in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yes. And so there may be other stores that have women\u2019s sizing that is larger than the typical sizing. And even whole stores geared towards that. And having, being able to pick from a wider variety like that will make it a lot easier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Assuming they have any styles that are suitable in the first place because there were things at Macys that I think would\u2019ve fit me but none of them looked like something I would want to wear to work in an office. I think the problem is right now the style that\u2019s out is slouchy, which I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">like that\u2019s not looking -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Right, you want something more structured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yes and I\u2019m really not picky about clothes. It\u2019s just the problem is that I don\u2019t like things that are, I don\u2019t necessarily like things that are fashionable. And so every so often there is a time when whatever\u2019s fashionable is something that\u2019s reasonable and I would actually like and then the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">next year I can\u2019t find anything. It\u2019s the same thing with sweaters too for that matter. And I could knit myself sweaters but it would take forever. So I\u2019m just hoping that my sweaters will still fit by the time I get to winter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: So just focus on getting clothing you feel comfortable in for summer first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yes. I\u2019ll look online and see if there are any plus-sized stores nearby because, yes, I don\u2019t know. I just feel so I got a weird vibe. When I was at the other staffing agency I was sort of thinking panic, panic, panic. I think maybe because the whole we can call, if I call you at 5:00 in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">evening and say you have something on for tomorrow, if I don\u2019t hear from you then you\u2019re on. And okay I would obviously return that call though there might be a voice-mail at 5:30. Is that, him being right before he leaves the office and then I\u2019d have to wait until next morning but <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">I don\u2019t know because he said, on the one hand he said well if something doesn\u2019t feel like a good fit you don\u2019t have to take it. But on the other hand he said well it really annoys me when I have four people who say they can work and then it turns out when I call them they\u2019re not ready to work that day <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">and stuff. And mixed messages and also sort of no appreciation for the fact that a lot of people who do temp work are also interviewing for permanent jobs and so you can\u2019t miss any days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">And I mean obviously I wouldn\u2019t miss lots of days but you can\u2019t schedule all interview around business hours. You can get something really early in the morning or really late at night maybe but there does have to be some time off I guess just the rigidity of it. And the fact that they don\u2019t seem to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">care that people are also trying to find full-time jobs which, it would make sense if you were at a full-time job but not expecting you to stay there. But if you are putting people in a job that you know is ending in three months or something, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">It was just really intense but I guess I\u2019ll I\u2019m supposed to call them on Wednesday to see if they have anything on Thursday. And there was also a full big problem with me getting my social security card because my passport expired in November. I never renewed it because at the time I was living in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">the house with the crazy people who were really bad at putting my mail in a place that I\u2019d actually ever be able to find it. So I didn\u2019t want to have it get sent to my place and it\u2019d get lost. And so the stuff, I had filled out the paperwork and everything and that envelope is still at Sydney\u2019s place <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">but there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t do it now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">I probably should; I just haven\u2019t been at Sydney\u2019s place so often and it hasn\u2019t been a problem. But you need either your passport or social security card and driver\u2019s license in order to prove that you\u2019re a U.S. citizen. And so my social security card was at my parent\u2019s house. And I called on Wednesday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">which is when I had gotten the call from the first temp agency. And my mom was already in DC and [inaudible at 00:12:47] was on her way to Portland, so it was only my dad at home and he was at work. So when he, he was going to scan it for me but my dad really, really, really sucks at technology. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">And I knew that the scan would be enough for now but I needed the actual card and I told him to send me the card. He ended up not being able to get the scan and so he said he\u2019d send it. I said send me the card. I\u2019m 100% sure I said send me the card. And he sent, he said okay, I sent it; you\u2019ll get it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">by Friday. It came on Saturday and then I opened it up and it was a scan of the card. So I was really, really mad. I mean I didn\u2019t tell my dad that I was really, really mad but I was just really pissed and after all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">And so I had to go down yesterday to get the stupid social security card. But now I have it. Why didn\u2019t I sort of understand for tax purposes and stuff why you need to have all these things. I just don\u2019t remember ever needing to bring my passport when I worked at the zoo. And I certainly didn\u2019t need <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">it when I was getting the grant funding. So maybe it\u2019s a thing with the temp agencies but I didn\u2019t realize it was this hard to start working. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yes, sometimes some of the paperwork requirements and just policies can be frustrating to get through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just oh and the other thing about the temp agency is also so they, because they have the relationships with their clients they send people right out to a job and don\u2019t do it, they choose first which means no interviews which means -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t get to stop by the place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: See the yes. So when I told them that I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s feeling a little out of your control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yes. I told them I preferred probably smaller jobs, a few days a week. If I can get enough of them that will line up one from another then if I\u2019m in an office that\u2019s really depressing and I know I\u2019m only there for two weeks then that\u2019s not really a problem. But yes there\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So it seems like you\u2019re seeming relieved on one hand because your parents are willing to continue to help you pay for the apartment if you get some temp work but anxious on another hand because <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to be thrown into a horrible environment and not be able to get out. And I don\u2019t want to burn bridges with other temp agencies too. And just I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to fail and I don\u2019t want to fail. I mean at least this time the jobs that they\u2019d be throwing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">me into are administrative type, office assistant, receptionist things so I wouldn\u2019t be doing data entry. But the environment was also a problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">And I\u2019m afraid if I I guess I shouldn\u2019t make that many plans based on whether or not I\u2019m getting interviews but I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll take a two month or a three month position and then get an interview. And then if I need to finish up the three months and not be able to start the, be able to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Make decisions that work for you. Have you continued to look for permanent positions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes. I applied to something yesterday and oh I actually found the perfect job. It was a zoo assistant at a zoo. And I meet almost all the requirements, including the background in archeology and anthropology, experience handling zoo objects, familiarity with the zoo which makes me think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">possibly they have a candidate in mind already because how many other people would be familiar with it? So I don\u2019t even know if I have a chance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">But, so this time what I did was I wrote the cover letter and I actually gave it to Bridget to look at to make sure that it\u2019s perfect because while it would\u2019ve been really neat to get it in yesterday, well and they only posted it on Friday anyways. And but yes I\u2019m not messing this one up. But I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">to be confident in my work that I cannot have to wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Having somebody else\u2019s eyes on it is not a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yes, so I guess that now -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Is there anybody you know there or can you personalize it at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure who would I guess I could look up and see who I think is going to do the hiring, although it\u2019s going to go through the Yale HR system first probably because right now I just have Dear Search Committee. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yes but knowing who works there I mean just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s the zoo proper. I only worked at the zoo but I do know some of the other people in other parts of the zoos. So maybe if Hailey Seymour is in charge of things and I\u2019m not sure she is. She\u2019s in charge of part of the zoo but I\u2019m not sure if she does the hiring stuff and I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">who I\u2019d be working with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Right but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: But she\u2019s the person I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: If she\u2019s the person you know and she\u2019s connected to the zoo, I think part of networking is just sending her an e-mail and saying hey noticed that zoo\u2019s hiring a zoo assistant. I\u2019m excited to put my name in, grease the wheels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: But then am I asking her for anything or just telling her hey I\u2019m applying? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well I think in letting her know that you\u2019re applying you obviously want the position; you\u2019d be happy for any information she could provide. You can\u2019t ask her hey can you put in, can you tell these people to hire me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yes I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t ask her that. But I think it\u2019s somewhat self-evident that you would like some help if possible by letting her know that you\u2019re applying and you have a relationship with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Except I\u2019m not even sure if she remembers me at this point because last time I worked a lot of stuff with her was Spring 2009.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Well you could remind her of that. Oh I know it\u2019s been a while; we worked together in the spring of 2009. I noticed you\u2019re still connected to the zoo. I\u2019m excited to put my name in the ring for the position that\u2019s open now. Thanks so much for your time. You\u2019re just refreshing memory and personalizing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">if you can because the system is very impersonal. And if this is an important one, you taking that extra step of reaching out and reminding any connection you have that there is a positive connection, that you have this history. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: But I should frame it as an informational, saying hi and letting them know that I\u2019m applying thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well I mean you might want to check go online, do a check I am not a career counselor so you can kind of look and see what are the best networking strategies when you have a past history with someone. Look for examples for what do people write on LinkedIn when they are trying to utilize <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">connections. Maybe familiarize yourself with what the best ways are. But it does seem like if you have this connection, it\u2019s a loose connection, you want to position yourself to use it as best you can. And I don\u2019t know what the exact wording for that would be; that\u2019s beyond my area of expertise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Well I wasn\u2019t even thinking wording; I was just kind of thinking more what kind of thing am I asking slash am I asking anything or am I just saying hi I\u2019m applying. Wording I can figure out if I have a vague idea at least what the direction of the letter is and right now I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yes I mean I guess I think you\u2019re indirectly asking for some assistance if possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yes, and I\u2019m doing that by telling them I\u2019m applying. Yes, I was really excited when I found it because I\u2019d just been planning on on Tuesday I\u2019d gone on the work website and saved a few jobs. And some were things that would be a good fit and some of them were long shots. And I went to look <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">at those same jobs on Sunday when Sydney had his game starting at 4:00 so I said I am going to try to get at least one job application in. And then I had done another search and there it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Up it popped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes. So I\u2019m really glad I found it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yes, well I hope that it goes in a good direction for you. I really do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Do you think it would be a good idea for me to try to take a temp job that lasts two to three months if I\u2019m trying to apply but I don\u2019t want to be without a job so I can stay in the apartment? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s fine because I think that in the big picture, a temp job is a temp job. And while you don\u2019t want to be flaky and not show up for things for smaller reasons, your career and getting yourself a permanent position is your main priority. And if you take a temp job and it\u2019s supposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">to be for two to three months and you get an opportunity to take a permanent position, then you resign in as a professional a way as you can. And if you\u2019re offered a position, you have negotiating room for a start date at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">So if you get offered a position they\u2019re not going to say and we need you to start tomorrow or you don\u2019t get it. They\u2019re going to offer you a position and you\u2019re going to say I\u2019m so excited; I appreciate the opportunity. I can start in two weeks. And then you give two weeks\u2019 notice at the other job. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">But we\u2019re getting a little bit ahead of ourselves because you don\u2019t have an offer in hand <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t have an offer but I do have to decide now whether or not do I tell them okay I can take two or three months position when I originally had said that when I had asked if I would be interested in shorter term things. So whether or not I tell them that when I call them up on Wednesday and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">see if there\u2019s anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: So I guess that you have a decision to make of whether you live with a little bit of the uncertainty of not knowing when you might get a position, when you might get an offer for something full-time and can you decline politely to a temp job if something, if you get an interview for something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">or if you get an offer for something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s just because the guys said oh call us, he said if you have a, are really, really, really sick or have a family emergency. So it seems like those are the only reasons I could miss work. And I guess if they have a policy like that and are going to be ridiculous about it, they should <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">know that people in temp jobs are applying for full-time things, then I guess I\u2019ll have to make up the really sick or family emergency. And I just feel so bad about doing that. I wouldn\u2019t obviously tell a job that I\u2019m going to be interviewing for another job but I wouldn\u2019t want to have to actively lie <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B32\">like that. But they\u2019re sort of forcing me to do that if I take a two to three month position like it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re going to continue to apply to permanent positions because that\u2019s what you ultimately want is something in your field. And if these conflicts arise then we can figure out the best way for you to manage the conflicts as they come up. But it seems you\u2019re kind of getting a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B51\">ahead of yourself and getting really anxious about it because it hasn\u2019t occurred yet. And you can say no I won\u2019t take a two to three month position or you can take one and see how you can fit it in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot of what ifs here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: Because I just am afraid I\u2019ll take one and then feel trapped and feel like I, it and of course the whole rest of what if I come to a really awful environment and I\u2019m stuck there for two to three months, and get too depressed to be able to leave and rather get depressed that I\u2019m, when I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">at work every day and feel miserable and wake up I was so bad when I was at that job but I\u2019ve been fine at other office environments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Do you think it was just the job there or were there other things different about that time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: I guess it was the job plus the lack of any socialization. And just being in the cubicle by myself with no interaction with anyone while I was doing my job because it was all through e-mail or the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: What was your social life outside of work at that time? I don\u2019t remember when exactly that was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: I was only there a week but I didn\u2019t really have a social life. I think I was still in Tekiah but I think I ended up missing a rehearsal instead of going and just it was come home to eat and sleep and that was brutal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yes. So part of it is also you were thinking about one week, which was a really intense experience. But it\u2019s a pretty isolated time so it might I wonder would there have been a way to accommodate to that situation? Knowing that the workday felt really isolating and in cubicles and not a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">lot of social interaction. If you were there a longer term would there be a way to compensate for some of that on the back end thinking about scheduling things with friends for the evenings or to try to balance it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">But one week really didn\u2019t give you time to do that. You had the negative experience of transitioning to a new place, feeling really uncomfortable in the days while you were there and not having any time to try to figure out how to compensate for that in the time out of work. So we don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C71\">happened it we would have done the experiment of trying to arrange the other parts of your day to make up for the work part of your day that was so negative. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know because like I said I don\u2019t mind doing work. I don\u2019t even mind doing work the entire time and not having much time for breaks. It\u2019s just being so isolated and not having anyone around just made me feel miserable. And I\u2019m not sure if socializing when I got home well even, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C91\">it would give me something to look forward to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Plus meet some of your needs for socialization. And also part of, I think, one of the things that we need to work on is being able to be resilient when there are things that are uncomfortable. Being able to tolerate some distress without it feeling so overwhelming. Being able to increase <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">that because there are going to be things that are really uncomfortable. There\u2019ll be times when you feel isolated or anxious or sad; those are parts of human experience and being able to tolerate those periods without becoming overwhelmed by them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">And I think what often feels overwhelming for you is that when you\u2019re having times like that you start to imagine that that\u2019s the course, not just for right then but also forever. It gets blown up to the future and that is very overwhelming. You\u2019re thinking about feeling isolated forever or even a long <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">period of time, months. That\u2019s really overwhelming. Being isolated for eight hours at a time is tolerable especially if the other times after that eight-hour workday is different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">And so that\u2019s one of the things I think that would really work for you is being able to trust yourself that you could tolerate some of that discomfort, be resilient to it and compensate for it in other places. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t know. Yes, because that should work hopefully. I just don\u2019t know why it was so bad there. I mean it was, I came out of work every day feeling like if this is what life is I don\u2019t want it anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">THERAPIST: But did you hear that? You came out of work every day. Five days, one week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">CLIENT: Oh a week and a half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">THERAPIST: So eight workdays, seven work days? So seven days and then you said if this is what life is. Life for how long? Write and see the limits on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: Well it was going to be three months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">THERAPIST: But three months is a semester. It\u2019s a very big difference between life forever, life for two months, life for two years. What you can tolerate for two months because it gets you these other things, right, because there\u2019s a benefit to being able to fulfill that job or another job. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB1\">not forever; it\u2019s a fairly short period of time. But being able to see it as one day at a time or five workdays at a time and then a weekend makes it a lot more tolerable than thinking that this is what life is going to be like. That\u2019s pretty extended.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">THERAPIST: And it can really feel like that when you\u2019re in the midst of something that feels miserable; it can feel like it\u2019s forever. Being able to step back and say okay really how long do I need to put up with this? Oh I need to put up with it for 10 more days or I know that\u2019s not the specific example <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">but finding ways to withstand really uncomfortable parts of life is part of life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yes. There are ways of me getting out of the house and stuff and I would have money and would not have to feel bad about stuff or things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yes. It\u2019s not learning to tolerate distress is not just for the purposes of being uncomfortable. It\u2019s because oftentimes there\u2019s another side to it, there\u2019s a reason like being able to keep your apartment, getting some structure to your days, feeling more independent. Those are the benefits <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E31\">of being a little bit more flexible in what kind of environment you can work in. You know you mentioned you have a couple\u2019s session coming up. This is <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">CLIENT: Tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Tomorrow? Do you want to talk at all about what you\u2019re hoping to get out of it, what you\u2019re I know you asked some questions about what to anticipate before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to figure out because it still has happened that I get really mad at Sydney. And even if I don\u2019t say anything he knows that I\u2019m mad because of the expression I have or something. And I want to figure out how I can deal with that in a way that he can handle because right now he seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E91\">like the only thing he can handle is me not being mad at him. But if he\u2019s made me upset, even if I don\u2019t choose to talk about it or something I don\u2019t really feel like I have the ability to let it go. And if I do that it\u2019ll just build up more and come out worse a little bit later. And I feel like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E92\">kind of unrealistic to say that I should never get upset with him in the first place if he\u2019s done something upsetting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: That does seem unrealistic, right, because I mean as we just discussed discomfort, distress is part of life. And him being able to tolerate some discomfort is the same as you needing to be able to tolerate some discomfort. Do you know what he\u2019s hoping to get out of it? Have you talked at <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB1\">all about what your expectations are with each other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">CLIENT: No I haven\u2019t. But this time he probably wants me to learn how I can deal with my anger so I don\u2019t get mad at him in the first place and care about his feelings more when I am upset, which right now it\u2019s really hard for me to do. And I sort of just get to the point where I feel like I don\u2019t care <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED1\">about his feelings. Something\u2019s going wrong and he could be missing (ph) me and stuff and he\u2019s upset because he gets upset so often I stop hearing, which is really, really horrible and I know that <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Feels like too many times that you\u2019re asked to care about his feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yes which I shouldn\u2019t but I\u2019ve just been so drained and stuff that it just makes it really hard to I know I should [inaudible at 00:36:34] and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something I could change or if I\u2019m doomed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a really strong word. I feel doomed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: Or if the relationship is doomed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Do you think it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know because I\u2019m not sure how to whether or not my feelings about that sort of stuff can change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">THERAPIST: But you feel they definitely need to in order to continue the relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">CLIENT: Well yes because I don\u2019t want to not care about him not being upset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Do you care about him being outside of an argument, like now? Do you care about whether he\u2019s upset or does that ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">CLIENT: Yes. If it\u2019s outside an argument and he\u2019s feeling sad I don\u2019t want him to be feeling sad or kind of ditches when it\u2019s an argument and it\u2019s something that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to maintain both your perspective and his at the same time. Yes, that\u2019s really challenging. Are there things you so that\u2019s something that you feel like you\u2019re assuming he needs you to change because you haven\u2019t really been able to talk about it with him. I mean you\u2019ve had arguments <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">and that\u2019s maybe what you\u2019re basing your assumption on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">CLIENT: Well yes because he had even mentioned it feels like you don\u2019t care at all when I\u2019m sad. And turning afraid like I actually stopped caring whether he\u2019s upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">THERAPIST: Are there things you feel like you need him to change that are kind of deal breakers right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">CLIENT: Yes, some of it is language related. He doesn\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019m often hyper-literal but it\u2019s really triggering when he says he\u2019ll do something in a few seconds and what he really means is 20 or 30 minutes later. And I\u2019ve told him please stop saying that; why don\u2019t you just say a few minutes <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201091\">or it will be a while and it won\u2019t be soon because if it\u2019s going to be a while he doesn\u2019t want me to get mad at him but I end up getting more mad if he\u2019s been lying to me in the first place about being able to do something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">THERAPIST: It feels like a lie, not a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">CLIENT: I mean I guess he\u2019s just not 100% sure that he can do it. He thinks maybe I\u2019ll be able to do it later but he doesn\u2019t tell me that. He says okay I can do it just give me a while. And eventually over many times he won\u2019t be able to and then he\u2019s wasted all of my time and I would\u2019ve been able to, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D1\">maybe I would\u2019ve had to put in some effort to do it myself but I might\u2019ve been able to do it myself depending on what the task or thing was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard you use the word hyper-literal. Is that his word, your word?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: His word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">THERAPIST: Do you agree with his assessment that ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It just sort of because I guess the context of things is people not meaning what they say. I guess it\u2019s one thing to get mad at someone if we were arguing about food and his example to me was you\u2019ll say oh well I don\u2019t really care; I\u2019m not hungry, which of course is me being <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201151\">upset and probably I am caring and am hungry. But I feel like there\u2019s a difference between that and being asked a direct question and not giving a truthful answer, which is what he does. And he\u2019ll say deal with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: So you feel like he\u2019s lying, I mean the words you use is lying to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">CLIENT: He asks can you do this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Are there other instances where you feel like your particular specificity with language and what it means gets in the way with you guys?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">CLIENT: Mostly in that context. I mean I guess just sort of southern, he learned that you shouldn\u2019t ask for things directly; you should beat around the bush and stuff and be polite.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2011C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855946\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011F\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s cultural differences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20121\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s not polite to it\u2019s one thing when a complete stranger asks hi how are you doing and you say fine; it\u2019s another thing when your girlfriend asks how are you doing and you say fine and you really mean no I\u2019m doing really horribly. And I might ask are you sure and he says <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201211\">yes. And if I\u2019m asking a second time he really should because it\u2019s sort of wanting confirmation because I am sort of picking up on the fact that he\u2019s upset or something but then he tells me, and for me the word overpowers any other nonverbal evidence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20123\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re really listening to the words and when there\u2019s a mismatch you\u2019re going to believe the words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20125\">CLIENT: Yes, even though I shouldn\u2019t. That would be way easier if he just used the words that mean what he feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20127\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve noticed that sometimes in here the specific word choice also really matters to you. If I say something that I need to be kind of, sometimes I say things I mean in a more general way and you really focus a lot of the specifics of a situation and a particular incident that we\u2019re discussing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201271\">Which isn\u2019t necessarily I\u2019m not pointing that out to say that\u2019s a problem but in a relationship or in a conversation, making sure that we\u2019re on the same page and sometimes being able to generalize can be helpful. But if I think we\u2019re talking about something in general and you think we\u2019re talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201272\">a particular moment, it might lead to feeling really misunderstood or frustrated <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20129\">CLIENT: But this isn\u2019t something that happens in my day-to-day life with normal people. And the other thing -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not, you\u2019re saying or does -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s not. And maybe because of course I expect there to be more boundaries between me and other people and if they ask me how I\u2019m doing I will probably say fine even though I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yes, so you want there to be a difference between your partner and your therapist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20131\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just instinct to have to put up a front to those things and I can do that for the time when I\u2019m upset with someone in my day-to-day life I could probably hold it in until I get away from them or something. But if I\u2019m around Sydney all the time I can\u2019t put up that front forever and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201311\">feels exhausting to have to do that. And maybe I never really had many arguments with Dad because I only saw him two or three days a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20133\">THERAPIST: A lot more individual time than intimate time. Well I hope that, this is the first meeting with the couples counseling project. I hope that it feels like a good match and you\u2019re able to develop a plan that would be helpful to you guys. Why don\u2019t we wrap up there for today? I need to check <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201331\">in with you about next week because I unfortunately need to have some medical tests that are going to get in the way of our session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20135\">CLIENT: Okay.

So I have to be out in the afternoon but I could come in in the morning, which might work better for you depending on what happens with work. So we\u2019re looking at the 19th.
