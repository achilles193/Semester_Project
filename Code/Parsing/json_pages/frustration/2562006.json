I don\u2019t feel very \u2013 I don\u2019t feel distressed all of the time but I think that there is something going on that\u2019s probably worth digging into. Sleep deprivation is hard. I mean it\u2019s really been about two months now, about 10 weeks since Grayson was born and he\u2019s still <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">waking up every hour, hour and a half for a stretch. Like he\u2019s able to sleep up to eight hours at a stretch, but it\u2019s never at night so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: We haven\u2019t been able to get him in synch with our preferred sleep schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I see. So he might sleep from (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s not that erratic but he\u2019ll go down typically around 6:30, 7, something like that and often, a couple of times he slept until 2 and then from 2 into the morning at which point he\u2019ll be going to sleep with some effort and then waking up not too long thereafter. So on the one hand it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">tough and on the other hand it\u2019s scary because Jennie starts teaching on the 22nd and it was just me at least on school days or the night before school days \u2013 I\u2019ll be getting zero done and that will feel like, that will be very distressing. That is something I\u2019m very worried about. Her dad has offered <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">to underwrite a night nurse at least for part of the time. But that helps a bit and we\u2019ll have my mother in town short term and so it will be mitigated to some degree but I\u2019m really concerned and just sort of \u2013 I have some ambient concern I think about a lot of stuff that we\u2019ve been talking about (unclear). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">My office is kind of a mess which is usually a telltale and there are kind of spasms of feeling upset with Jennie, upset with other people. I think it\u2019s free-floating. Anyway. So there\u2019s that and you know, the rest of the time it\u2019s very pragmatic. Grayson\u2019s still great. He\u2019s been doing really well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">really well. THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: He\u2019s very \u2013 he\u2019s becoming more and more kind of engaged and engaging. That\u2019s fun. He\u2019s still not \u2013 he\u2019s still very infantile so there\u2019s a lot of projection going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well, I mean obviously \u2013 on the one hand, obviously, on the other hand it\u2019s a little bit, it takes \u2013 most of the energy in terms of imagining what he\u2019s up to is coming from my end still and I think that among the other exhausting aspects of this process is the burden of conceptualizing this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">relationship in a way that feels exciting. And it does. I\u2019m not \u2013 it\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad. But I imagine when he\u2019s a little more self-propelled it will be a little easier, if other things may be a little bit more difficult you know, so a lot of the time I can just sort of give him (unclear) and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">fun and there\u2019s always something to do. [0:05:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">But I began working with a friend on a panel for the American Anthropological Association conference next year. But yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t know. I think the identity question is kind of a vessel for some of the worry and sense of dislocation that I\u2019m feeling. In other words, professional identity question <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I think is a convenient box to put all of these complicated psycho-dramatic, psychodynamic cards. It\u2019s easily intelligible by me and so I think I tend to understand these larger questions mostly in terms of what will I be doing and what will my work be? Will I be able to write effectively and these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">kinds of things. Sometimes the idiom is practical, sometimes the idiom is kind of existential. That\u2019s most of what I feel worried about \u2013 consciously, at least, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562006\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">You know, I\u2019m concerned about being trapped. I feel concerned about being trapped in a role that I enjoy but don\u2019t want to be the sum total of my life. I feel concerned that in order for Jennie to get off the ground which has been difficult the last couple of months, I\u2019ll have to completely give everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">up. I feel concerned that there\u2019s just not going to be any opportunity for me to do anything. Like I\u2019ve burned my bridges and nobody\u2019s really going to want me at this stage in my life and my career. What other worries can I catalog? I feel concerned that I won\u2019t be able to write anything good and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">I can\u2019 produce the manuscript or two that I\u2019d like to come out of the next six months. I mean if I did that it would feel good. You know, if I could come up with an article, the dissertation manuscript and maybe a rough draft of the novel. That would feel great, I think. I would be able to justify that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">to myself, I think. Whatever that means. That\u2019s probably a significant statement. But that\u2019s how that feels right now and yet it feels like there are all these impediments ranging from internal impediments to external impediments and they\u2019re really worrying me to the point that it\u2019s hard for me to get going even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s probably where I am. Missing a couple of sessions was interesting because I don\u2019t think I do that very often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: And the only other time that it happened that I recall or that there was some kind of confusion on my part and we decided that it was significant. The event dislocation was significant and I would \u2013 accepting that premise \u2013 I would hazard a guess that it\u2019s significant again. We\u2019d been talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">about our interaction in terms that were probably relevant to my \u2013. It was the same kind of thing. Like I didn\u2019t and still kind of don\u2019t have any memory of the way that it was supposed to be, the time that we were supposed to be. And part of that was being sleep deprived but there was also \u2013 I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">it\u2019s reasonable, at least to speculate about something else as well. So part of it is our interaction, you know, that\u2019s a productive train of thought but I think also part of it is just \u2013 I really feel dislocated. My days don\u2019t have distinguishing characteristics in some important way. And that lack <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">of definition I think is classic of being at home with an infant but also \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see. Like a confluence of that and (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: And also, I think it\u2019s also just sort of a larger sense of feeling featureless in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(Pause): [0:10:28 0:11:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Well one clear difference it seems to me between now and let\u2019s say, three months ago, is that it seemed like Grayson had not really arrived yet and home stuff in general really provided you with structure and a role in a way that really helped. Whereas, now it seems like the part of it that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">you\u2019re feeling more strongly \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s gone, I\u2019m just saying the part of it that you\u2019re feeling and reacting to more strongly seems to be the sort of dislocating aspect of where Grayson is at and what he needs and maybe this is more anticipatory than present, but Jennie, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562006\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: What do you mean? More anticipatory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, she\u2019s not back at work yet and so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but she already needs, she needs. She wasn\u2019t able to get working until I kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So she\u2019s been doing \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, she did a review. It\u2019s like I have to take Grayson for \u2013 I took him for two or three days, you know, in order to get her going, both \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Then I would revise what I said to be present as well as anticipatory. I guess I wasn\u2019t as clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: She has had a hard time with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: And I have felt, I think, rightly you know \u2013 correctly \u2013 I don\u2019t know about rightly, that if I didn\u2019t do it then we were going to have a real problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: You know, apart from it being difficult to write or do creative work the last couple of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I remember you saying that she seemed depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: It was like three or four days that I was basically with him all the time. And it took her a long time to do some stuff that didn\u2019t necessarily have to take that long. In other words, some of it was just the practicalities of needing to have relief or release in the (unclear) of childcare. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">part of it was just needing to carve out some of the old kind of working space from our household which is not dominated by childrearing, I think, and whatever increment of depression there had been as well. But you know, I had to do that and I had to do that for like four days. I think it was four <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">days that I did that before these three relatively modest projects were done. Now, do I regret it? No. It worries me. I\u2019m worried about being mommified, you know? I\u2019m worried about that becoming my life. I\u2019m thrilled to be the parent of a child. I\u2019m thrilled to be \u2013 I\u2019m thrilled with the very frankly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F3\">thoughtful and finely wrought idea of equitable childrearing that we arrived at through much discussion and thought that we\u2019ve been really able to deploy because I\u2019m unemployed. Otherwise, Jennie\u2019s on maternity leave, but I worry about what happens to that. And I worry about being screwed by it. [0:14:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I think at some level I feel very resentful about \u2013 and this is not a great revelation \u2013 but I feel very resentful about the impact of my parent\u2019s ideology on my life, you know? Being a new man and working for a new world and so on and so forth. Like something that is easily exploited and exploitable <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What did they mean by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: You know \u2013 being sensitive and being caring and not being too aggressive. You know, whether it\u2019s accurate or not, I think at times in my adolescence and early adulthood I felt very pissed off because it seemed very easy to (Pause) \u2013 hmm. The asshole frat boys call it \u201cbeing friend zoned\u201d where <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">you\u2019re very empathetic and people like to talk to you. They don\u2019t like to have relationships with you. I think when I was \u2013 I dated a fair amount in high school but I often had the thought that it didn\u2019t prepare you to actually be in a good relationship. It actually taught you to be the person who counseled <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">all the hot women who were in the bad relationships. You know, that\u2019s a little bit caricatured.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562006\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">There\u2019s a more general and more kind of troubling pervasive aspect to this which is just the bad faith that I often feel about people\u2019s references to and exhortations to \u2013 I mean it wasn\u2019t \u2013 what is now in the usual parlance, progressive ideology \u2013 you know, it was socialist. It was communist. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">radical. And in one of the things that was very difficult about my father\u2019s death was a kind of coming to terms with the idea that it was also very personally convenient and exploitable and I think that in this negotiation and just sort of evolution of our household with Jennie, I\u2019m very concerned about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">being screwed in the same way. I have an acute sensitivity to the likelihood, or prospect or possibility of being screwed in this way.

I don\u2019t know exactly how to think about the mechanism but there\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">going on. So, I don\u2019t know what it is I\u2019m repressing. I don\u2019t know what it is that I\u2019m not in touch with. I mean you know, this is presumably only the tip of the iceberg. I would imagine there are other things I am not remembering. I\u2019m not remembering to work. I\u2019m not remembering the state of mind in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">which I do work creatively.

Long ago when there was not some relationship between this kind of practical forgetting and the difficulty remembering emotional states or the difficulty remembering kind of who I am and what\u2019s good about me and kind of all of the memory that goes into having a consistent non-erratic <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">personality that is productive, that works, that makes me happy, that\u2019s gratifying, etc. You know what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: I wonder if (Pause) \u2013 you do have the toughest most demanding boss who requires the most self-abnegation and sacrifice that you\u2019ve ever had and probably ever will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know about that. (Pause) No, that seems like frankly, because of things that are difficult about dealing with demanding bosses are not relevant to a technical, I mean, I assume that\u2019s what you mean. No, I mean it\u2019s completely different. Sure, Grayson\u2019s demanding. His needs are immediate <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">and they need to be addressed and they\u2019re not always clear and all of these things but I don\u2019t need to imagine to model his thought world at all in order to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: But you told me that you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t worry that he\u2019s judging me which was always the really difficult thing about dealing with bosses.

Here\u2019s what I will say. Here\u2019s something with regard to Grayson at least. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what you\u2019re quite talking about but I have worried about \u2013 given the fact that my career is derailed at the moment at least, momentarily at least, I worry about doing what I perceive at least, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">my father to have done, which was really kind of live through me in a way that was not very \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was very fulfilling for him but it definitely wasn\u2019t very good for me as an adolescent. And I worry, I thought to myself on several occasions, you know, that would be a bad thing. I would be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200992\">a little concerned about, especially if I am the primary responsibility for child care for a while, I worry about that dynamic asserting itself. And in a half comic way this has come up in the last week because I\u2019ve been using this great camera that Jennie\u2019s Dad got us a lot and I\u2019ve been taking some <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200993\">really awesome pictures and Grayson\u2019s just a really beautiful child and so we would say to each other, oh my God, he\u2019s like a model. And at one point you now, I can\u2019t tell if it was a lark or not and I felt very uncomfortable with it afterwards, but I actually took the four most beautiful photographs <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200994\">and I sent them to modeling agency and asked them if they\u2019d be interested and I\u2019m pretty sure I just wouldn\u2019t follow up with it, you know. Because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that I need to be spending his or her time doing. But it did intersect in a \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562006\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m beginning to worry that you\u2019re starting with his career.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Not that I\u2019m starting with his career early but that I just sort of sublimate, you know, it is sort of this paradox where by sublimating my needs for his I\u2019m actually sublimating his interests for mine. You know just becoming one of those parents that\u2019s kind of an ex-beauty queen and dresses <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">her four-year old up in makeup and takes her to pageants. So that kind of thing I think is kind of the same thing as you\u2019re talking about. The feeling of resentment against the demanding taskmaster of the 10 week old I swear, I don\u2019t see that at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You seem to have this idea that you seem to be being worked on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: No. I don\u2019t have any regrets about the last 10 weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: No, I\u2019m not saying you seem to have regret.

What I\u2019m saying is that if by June I haven\u2019t gotten anything done in the kind of classical definition of work and all that I\u2019ve done is raise a beautiful, well-adjusted nine-month old child, then I will feel real existential panic because then that will mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">that in some sense I really have made the kind of sacrifice that you\u2019re talking about. It hasn\u2019t happened yet but I worry about it. I worry about \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I understand but here\u2019s what where I\u2019m confused. If Jennie\u2019s working full time and you don\u2019t really have child care \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: We\u2019ll have three months of our parents and we\u2019ll have a night nurse. That sounds like child care to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Okay. I didn\u2019t know you were going to have your \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: My mother for a month. There\u2019s like a month and a half in which we won\u2019t have. But Jennie\u2019s mother will come down from Connecticut for extended stays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Alright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: You know, I mean we\u2019ll be okay for childcare in terms of spelling me. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s unrealistic. That was the whole premise of this first academic year. The reason we set it up like this instead of getting home daycare during infancy, was A \u2013 we didn\u2019t want to send such a young infant <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">to home daycare. No matter how good it might be, that\u2019s not how we want it. B \u2013 We couldn\u2019t afford a full time nanny and C \u2013 we had some options that could facilitate. Jennie working the way she needs to work and me at least getting enough time if I\u2019m working adequately I can get it done conceivably. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true.

I had said \u2013 I talked to a friend of mine and she\u2019d said that there was some adjuncting work and we thought about it and discussed it and decided that it just wasn\u2019t worth it.

I feel some resentment against something. Maybe it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">part of this resentment against whoever sold me whatever bill of goods \u2013 [0:36:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">(Pause): [0:37:28 0:37:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: I feel kind of \u2013 at moments I feel kind of enraged about this.

It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">a very consistent look varying from the secretary of Leila Justin (sp?) at the journal to, you know the guy who took over my office at Brown Medical School who\u2019s an M.D. and you know, was able because of that to find a niche. You know, and it said, \u2018there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to find a niche here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D12\">I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re trying. It\u2019s kind of sad that you\u2019re trying. It\u2019s really too bad.\u2019 And this was after the director had said, \u2018I will always have a job for you.\u2019 Which he promptly abrogated within two months and yet \u2013 I\u2019m rambling a little bit. But you know, he said that. He said it very <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D13\">explicitly. He took me aside to say it to me. It was the summer that I was completing my dissertation and I completed my dissertation and then I had nothing. You know, the last two years have been an ultimately failed effort to get something out of that. You know he felt some sense of obligation, enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D14\">of a sense of obligation to say this to me but not enough of a sense of obligation to follow through on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">Anyway, so mixed up in all of this is that real specific (unclear) sense of anger and resentment and the sense of Jennie calls it \u2013 there\u2019s a Hebrew idiom, \u201cthey ate me, they drank me.\u201d (Unclear pronunciation). You know, the sense of they just totally screwed me and just getting very wrapped up in that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">And this feeling and recurring series of images and memories and you know, distal relationships is implicated somehow in the state of my office and in my difficulty working and in my frustration over not working despite the fact that I\u2019ve been getting two and a half hours of bad sleep for the past two <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D32\">and a half months. And my vision for what\u2019s next and my difficulty kind of coming up with a concept of the next step. You know it\u2019s hard for me to come up with that concept when I just feel so pissed. And that anger boils down to just burning resentment about that look, that kind of paternalistic, condescending, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D33\">unearned look by people who are stupider than I am, who are less talented than I am; who don\u2019t deserve to feel that sense of hierarchal superiority.

And in my fantasy it serves it explicitly. There\u2019s some expression of this resentment that comes out. And then it\u2019s gone. And then it doesn\u2019t bother me anymore.
