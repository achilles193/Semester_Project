I was up at 5:30. I had to be in Attleboro at 7:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I don t even know where that is. I ve heard of it though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: You don t know where it is. God. I thought I was the one that was the tourist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: By the shore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: No. God no. It like straight south like halfway between Cranston and the coast so it s like right in the middle there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: In the middle of nowhere. Whoa. When you re from around here, if it s like south or west of Providence it doesn t really exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (Laughs). Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: We don t acknowledge Johnston or any of those places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Poor Johnston. Hillsgrove and, God, Pawtucket, and all of those places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Hillsgrove we can recognize because that s in another state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, that s <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: But Pawtucket (unclear).  So what were you doing in Attleboro?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Well, that s funny because I got to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: They have a race track there, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I won t (unclear) too much. You ve made me quickly exceed the limits of my familiarity with Attleboro. No, I got an e-mail on Wednesday from this lady saying, I got a referral from so and so and so and so production company that they might be available to do a video shoot on Friday morning. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">And I have no idea who referred me, don t know who the hell they are. But yeah, I might be available so I was representative Congressman Joe Kennedy coming to this classroom to talk about STEM, you know, Science Technology whatever for this program called Digits. It s like this math, engineering, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">get kids interested in that kind of thing and it s a nonprofit and I said, yeah, here s what it would cost. And they said okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Well, that s cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: We ll see how this one turns out. So I had to be down there by 7:30. It s not something you don t really consider that skill set to be part of my main competencies so it s always a little bit of a nerve-wracking thing like I hope that camera is running. I have my iPhone set up on a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">tripod that was catching another angle and anyway it s good, really good quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It s amazing what they used to carry and now you can do with <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: And the quality of the picture is <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: This is actual HTV that came in about three years and (unclear) that much and used to be (unclear)  but anyway, I show up to it at 40 minutes past the hour recording and it s like not recording anymore. I had to record it again. It cannot record not enough memory because it s a 16 gig. Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">why would anybody buy a 32 gig who would ever do that? Now I know. So anyway. We ll see how it goes. That was a learning experience and a fun maybe I ll have some better equipment for more (unclear) work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, so that was this morning and yesterday I had a job interview. We ll see how it goes. I don t know. They re going to make the decision next week. It s a radio program on WGBH and yeah. I don t know. That s what s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: So that s what you ve been doing. How have you been feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Feeling good, actually. I actually finished editing this see when I see you every two weeks I can t remember what was said last time. And anyway, when I was in Mexico I shot a lot of video of different things that were of interest to me and one of them was this Dominican woman living on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">coast of Mexico and has this cigar shop. And she took us through this entire process of making a cigar. Angie even taped her. And that was one of the projects I had hoped to get to sooner than four years later but it s a lot better than I thought it would be and there are also some things I would have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">like to have done better but I know for the next time. So I got that done this week so that felt good. I m kind of philosophical about the job it s like well if it doesn t happen, you know, I m certainly not going to force it. I don t really have much choice of course, and it s nor do I really have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B3\">a choice of feeling bad about it because I thought I presented myself well and you know, I mean if either one of us doesn t see it as a fit, it s not a fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Is it something that you are actively pursuing? Because you never really talk about doing the job search thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well, I always keep an eye out for things, specifically GBH because I think they re they have more solid funding than WBUR, it s just, I think the endowment there is bigger but anyway they always have a lot more jobs posted on their site and every once in a while I would apply for something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">on the front line or something and never get a call back. It wasn t a surprise, but it s just (unclear) World and enlisting in that program since Tony Cohn (sp?) was hosting it back in the mid-90 s. So it s been a while. It s for a program that s called Providence Con and it actually is segments from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">the World that we hosted that week that had to do with America s place in the world and how America interacts in the world. It s a rather loose criteria but it s packaged into a half an hour show on BBC world service which I actually heard one of his episodes when I was in the UK. So when I saw that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">this was opening up and he wants me basically to just produce the program and  oh, I can do that. You know, this is the first actual interview I ve done in 14 years like for walking in cold, not even longer than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I ve been walking in cold to a company that I have no idea about. It s been a long time so it s a little nerve-wracking but no, I ve been feeling pretty good these last few weeks and you know, one of the things that I talked about last time was why I do work that I enjoy, not as really work, or why <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">is it discounted as being less than valuable or whatever? And I ve actually thought about that off and on and you know, I actually don t really have a really good answer. I mean, there was this ethic with which I was raised that you did your chores and then you got to do whatever was fun. And of course <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">it makes sense. You ve got to clean your room before you can go to the movies. But this was like actual, serious chores every day and on Saturday there were whole, seemingly endless lists of it. When I look back, it s like, gosh, it probably took it would have taken no time had I not been procrastinating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I bet your mom said that a couple of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Oh, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: If you just did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: You do a good job when you actually do it. But I hated doing it and I d drag my feet and mowing the lawn the idea that fun happened the work was something that well it instilled in me the idea that I could enjoy what I do after I don t enjoy what I have to do, that much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And do you have to not enjoy the have-to s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: No. But I think it all depends on what is on the docket for the day. What do I want to achieve? And if I can get those things out of the way, if I can do them, the things that I it s hard for me to define what s enjoyable and what s not enjoyable because theoretically, getting the things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">I want to get done that day is enjoyable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Actually feels good, too. The completion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: The completion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Of the actual thing, too. Washing the dishes or mowing the law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. And even cleaning the basement for example, is one of those things that I enjoyed doing and would do it every once a month. I d go down there and I could be by myself and I could go through stuff and (unclear) stuff and throw stuff out. The same thing with the garage. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">It just is a I was going to say, an occupational hazard, but it s more of a functional hazard of my interests. So that kind of thing I might not get to but even though it needs to be done, if I do it I m not sure it s as rewarding as something that I don t want to do, you know? Which seems kind of odd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: How much is it getting in the way of doing, of getting one of the things that you talked about over the course of time is doing stuff that you actually, really enjoy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: The goal is for them to be balanced, for there to be things that you enjoy in life, to be doing the things that you need to be doing to keep yourself healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well and I think this past week has been a pretty good record setting aside how long it takes to get through five pages of a transcript of one of these interviews that I had transcribed because I have to correct them from the transcriber. Things like, you know, peace process gets turned <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">into pigs process. I have to go through and make sure you re <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Suddenly, you re working on a farm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And so, anyway, it s kind of mundane and so it s like I did five pages every day and it s done and it took very little time. And so doing it in chunks that s been really effective. And then I work on the video. So I can get this out of the way and I won t have it hanging over <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">my head. That s the chore and that s a (cross talk) word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: (Unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: But it does come back to this idea that, well, I have worked on videos that haven t been fun. I m feeling like this one that I shot today is going to be one of those so I might have to actually break that up into chunks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: How would that be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I don t know. So it s hard for me to identify them, right? So it s I don t know why. I think it s just this idea that real work, real work is one of those things that we don t enjoy doing. And that s a horrible thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: If we could change that back to what it actually was before. Chores are something that you don t enjoy doing. Work doesn t always have to be a chore. There probably are elements of work that are a chore. I called Blue Cross today and it s been on my list of things to do for probably it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">gets carried over from week to week, deal with Blue Cross, deal with Blue Cross, deal with Blue Cross a. That s a chore. It s not what I actually consider my work. It s a thing that has to get done once in a while and if you could more accurately segment out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: This part is awful and I ll feel really good when it s done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Right. And it s a part that necessitates maybe, or facilitates something else happening in your work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: But there are <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Getting paid, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that s good once in a while. But for you, being able to separate out you ve let the chore piece kind of morph over everything and you know, what started this whole idea probably did start back in childhood when there was a list of things you had to do and as a kid that was work. But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">really it was chores. And there are chores in everyday life. There are chores in work. There s chores in a relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Being able to maintain the work of being in a relationship sometimes. And if you can fairly delineate what s actually <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, what s, yeah. And even to call work work is kind of, I don t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: What would you like to call it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Fun. I mean if you separate the chores part out, then work becomes I think, a term for what you choose to do. Something that you re paid for, of course, but you chose it for a reason, therefore, how much work is it if you separate the chore part out? So I don t have a good answer for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So just the associated feeling with the word, like (unclear) is just a word but there s a lot of baggage tied up in it, so whether if you change, find a more appropriate word than work for you or if it s changing that maybe something work isn t something for you to be afraid of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: But that might be hard. It doesn t matter which way you do it. But I think finding something that more appropriately really means what you want to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, and it s almost like the difference between a job and a career, you know. A career is something that you develop over time. A job is just something that (unclear your hand as far as the way I see it, exercise has that negative connotation, for me at least. Working out you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: After the work you put in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: You can call it like gym class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Gym class. Gym fun. (Laughs) Recess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: You know, a lot of stuff you do at the gym is what kids do play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: When did it become not play?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: When you put it on the machine and it doesn t go anywhere?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Exactly. So, yeah. I think just trying to balance the things I want to get done, months can go by, as they have where if I don t touch something it never gets done. And that feeling just eats at me. And I don t know, it s in this whole venture of being paid to do video work is just so bizarre <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">to me because I wouldn t pay me to do the work that I do. (Laughing). But some people are desperate, so <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Or some people see the value in it. Some people yeah, I suppose. Somebody referred you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: You don t know who.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Well, I think it s because I joined this film and video group on Linked In . I think they were like, well, here s a guy. Anyway, it s not going to question it. It s something that I m going to view as a gift and not as a talent exactly but the opportunity to work as a gift, but a talent that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">I m developing and nonetheless, you know, I sometimes, and I don t want to lose the train of this thought because it could easily happen, the idea of a skill that you didn t think you would use ever again. That s where the train of thought was going. But like an old friendship, you know, when you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A72\">think about somebody that you knew really well 10 years ago. You worked with him every day and you were really close and you kind of mourn that that friendship may be dead. In the same way, when he comes back around and you, for whatever different circumstances you are now, beyond a Facebook kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A73\">link, and actually having that idea of something that s a skill, like Arabic or something. I have this feeling that I may never use that again. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: But it could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: But it could. You never know. And that s just it. The hope that the video work that I did a while back is something that is reprising now and whatever I choose to do with it is encouraged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And holding onto that knowledge that there is uncertainty in a non-intimidating way it doesn t always have to be bad, but uncertainty is a chance that there s something unexpected good to happen, to have these gifts sort of returned and followed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: And (Pause) yeah, I think the I think a pitfall for me is when I start to expect that okay, well, how come no one is calling? But to treat them as gifts, as one-off s and if something comes, it s not a gift and always a chance to capitalize on the money we paid to learn this craft deeper, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">better, more efficiently, more professionally, better quality defined, better quality tools to use. So I don t really know. I m just feeling like I don t know what I m talking about. It seems very non-therapist about it, career counseling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: That s where you ve been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: It has in the last 24 hours, that s for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Sounds very pleasant. (Pause) It s also something to pay attention to. I know switching every other week is partly an experiment. I know I heard you say when you came in, I don t remember what I talked about last time. It feels so far away. And one of the things that happens when you spread <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">out visits is that you use them to focus on what, content-wise, just happened, because it is harder to maintain the thread from one session to the other. So it s just something for us to pay attention to is does that enhance the work being more present, focused? Do you lose something in it? There <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B52\">is no magic right times to meet or how often, but we want to pay attention to what s right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: True. True. Is this your way of saying you missed me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: This is my way of responding to what you just said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, okay. Sorry. No. Yeah. I (Pause), I m not sure what is right right now because I called the hospital and said, I just want to make sure you still have my name or (unclear). Yes, we do, we just don t have enough people yet, but we hope to get started. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Waiting for their numbers. That s the hard part about a group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Surprisingly, to me, I think. Because everybody should use it it should be in the curriculum at school.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: That s probably true. But it s getting their interest times to be available when I hope that will come together because I know the skills groups have been really useful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: And frankly, it may be that I probably go back to weekly until it actually starts if you d look at your clinic calendar and see if that works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">(Pause): [00:25:33 00:25:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: It s funny but in the past two weeks I have thought about going for a massage twice and they were both <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Does that feel like more than usual or less than usual?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Well, more than usual for the past month. Less than usual the past six months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: But the more revelational part of it is the circumstances under which I was thinking about it. I think what you say about my wanting to flirt with somebody, what am I trying to escape from? The circumstances were both late at night, I was exhausted, and I don t know what else. Not that I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">thinking about going at that time, but thinking, well, maybe I ll go tomorrow or something. The next morning I woke up and I was like, I don t want to do that. It was a completely different attitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: It passed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: It passed and I just wonder what how much of it is just me being tired in every way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: What were your, if you think about it being late at night, being exhausted and that thought comes into your head. What is it that what s the need? What are you trying to fulfill with that thought?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: I don t know. Maybe excitement. Attraction. Though I think that is a mis <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Having someone be attracted to you or you being attracted to somebody?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Having somebody be attracted to me. But I think that s kind of a misappropriated expectation or even assessment even of what is really happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">(Pause): [00:28:32 00:28:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: What did you do instead?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Fell asleep. (Pause) Yeah, just went to bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it s a really good lesson or reminder that feelings come and go. Anxiety attacks come and go. They always recede and deciding which ones you want to attend to and which ones you want to just let pass you by is what gives you so much power. We can t necessarily change our feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">or snap out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: That doesn t actually happen. We can choose what we attend to, what we reinforce, what we seek out, and so those feelings may be perfectly legitimate that are tired, exhausted, want someone to take care of you. Part of it is wanting someone to be attracted to you, they ll take care of you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">make you feel better in lots of ways. So you can, rather than directing that in some way that in the long term you don t feel good about, you can let that feeling reach its peak and go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, and you know, I think fully surrendering myself to the better judgment in my head, that voice that says you don t want to do that. That s just (inaudible), has been something I ve been trying to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">And it s been effective and it s also been I mean just to know when you do that, when you almost relinquish control to the better judgment, how much control you actually have, it s I can t remember what the word is, but (Pause) it s counter intuitive I guess. Because when you open up a pint of Ben <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">and Jerry s and you say, well, I m only going to eat three scoops. And when you re going back there for your fourth and you say, well, I can t do this, I don t really want to. It s not a big deal, I ll just have a fourth. And that voice in your head saying, why are you doing this? You don t need <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB2\">this. This isn t going to help you. This isn t going to help you feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">And so the experiments in listening to it, giving it the better <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Is that what the voice says? Why are you doing this? You don t really want this? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: It s a very judgmental voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Well, you know, how do I change that voice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Well, I think the idea of having a voice that speaks to what your true desire is, and that s the one that s for survival, right? The one that s going to make choices that make you happier, longer term versus the, if we were Freudian, you d say, that s the id which wants that fourth scoop <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">and then a fifth and a sixth because it tastes good and you want it now. Your superego which is the very moral voice which maybe says, no, that s not the appropriate serving size you should have. And you ve got the ego which is sort of between that which is able to balance those instinctual needs <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F72\">and urges versus that really moral compass that might be too strict. Lots of shame and guilt (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">So if you re able to change that superego voice to be something that s encouraging, supportive, rather than punitive and you may end up in the same place, making good ego choices. Good ego choices are things you feel good about in the short term and you feel good about in the longer term. They match <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">up with what you what your sort of stated goals are and what your beliefs and values are. But they re not punishing so things like that voice I would hear saying something like, huh, part of me really wants another scoop. I said I was only going to have three. What do I really want? You may end <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F92\">up saying, I want four but not five. And that s okay. Or you may say, yeah, it s important that I stick with what I said before because I feel good about sticking with the original plan. It just feels different to me than having someone say, no, you don t really need that, why are you going to have it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: No, I think you re right and I think actually where that voice used to say, you really can t change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It s moved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: It s moved the other way. I think in recent time the past week or two I think that voice has been more effective perhaps because it s not saying, what the hell s wrong with you? It s saying you don t need this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the voice you have in your head now and what you just described, it s really an attempt to be a good teacher. And when I think about the types of voices that we hold in our head, they re usually teachers or parents, the way we talk to ourselves to try to get us to do something. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">it s like the voice you have now I think is a very well-intentioned teacher, but there may be some unintended consequences in the way in which you re talking to your students. And some students it s like, my original research was (unclear) athletes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">And we d look at coaches and how many of their team members became anorexic. And the coaches were training probably most of the girls on his team the same, using the same words, using the same techniques, not all of them are going to become anorexic. A good number of them in the sports we were looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">at are going to and looking at why why were some women protected? Not women, but girls I m so trained to say women. Why were some girls protected and some girls weren t from those kinds of messages? So the way that you are talking to yourself, for some people they might be able to just not hear <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201032\">the judgment in why are you doing this? I don t think you re that person because the voices you ve had in your head and the voices you ve had in your real life have been pretty judgmental and there s been a lot of shame and guilt that has been a result of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">THERAPIST: So being careful to pick a teacher or a way of speaking to yourself that doesn t hit on those same buttons because you re going to be a bit more vulnerable to them than someone who has never considered that they might be bad or a creep in your words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. Did you know my dad was a teacher?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">THERAPIST: That s not why I chose that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">CLIENT: No, I think that s a good actually, because I think there has been, I think we ve talked about this before there has been this question that you pose which is, where do these voices come from? Who was that? Who represents that? Who do you think you are? You know, you re not special and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201111\">things like that. And I can t, I think some of them are applicable to my dad for example and I think my mom. I don t know. But for so long they ve been me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: That you can t hear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">CLIENT: That I can separate it, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">THERAPIST: And they may have been things, a lot of times in messages that we internalize that don t come from a specific source, but I don t know, someone who s been church going the particular tone of their pastor. You know, and it might not be that the message was directly said to you, but something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">that you picked up and internalized. There s a big difference between someone who s saying you are carrying the original sin and must always and someone says, you know, this is an open, welcoming and confirming church. So what you absorb from that might not be a specific person talking to you but <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201172\">just what are the magazines that you read? What are the messages you pick up from that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: Midwest farmer. Yeah. So what were the sports that you ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: I did ballet and gymnastics in my research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: I thought so because you were you did that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">THERAPIST: I had to go through those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">CLIENT: Did you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Did you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: You can ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: Well were you was the research a result of your own experiences?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I don t know, to be honest. Certainly it was an interest of mine. I went to grad school following a professor at work with eating disorders, which was certainly an interest of mine. I felt I very closely identified with the dancers, gymnasts, and certainly those are sports where women seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">to have more problems with that. But there s no one moment I can point to and say like this is why I m so (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Well, and this may be (unclear), did you have a struggle with eating disorders?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855942\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">THERAPIST: No. I was one of the protected ones.

We still don t know. Is it ? I certainly had friends that did and I was lucky enough not have ever struggled with that stuff. I think part of my interest was like well why this person and not that person who had so many of the same experiences and came from <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201331\">when you grow up with someone on the same gymnastics team, whose socio-economic status is similar, blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">CLIENT: Were there other sports you looked at?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: Not in my research but certainly in others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: Because I just can t those two would seem like obvious possibilities, but I can t think of other women s sports where that s done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Rowing tends to have a high incidence of eating disorders. Long distance runners tend to have higher than other sports. Weight lifters, men more so than women. Wrestlers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Things like baseball, basketball, football tend to be well protected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, a little too well protected. Okay. I was just curious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: The transcriber s going to be like, what the heck? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: Pig s process, peace process.

So you know, that<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: You were talking about the internalized messages in your head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: I think that the circumstances, whatever they are that I m currently dealing with, are also have a lot to do with how that voice is pitched and how I hear it. These days where I m feeling like I ve accomplished things that I want to accomplish and have developed things creatively. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201491\">those routine elements tend to lay a positive foundation for me to hear that voice as a teacher and not a prison warden whatever, you know. But my experience in actually listening to that voice, hearing that voice and heeding it is so limited that it s what I m actually trying to cultivate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Well, it s been spoken a lot less often than the other, more punitive voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: It takes a lot of repetition for it to become a voice you really trust that s going to get a result that feels good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: And for it to become the go-to voice you re more like not paying specific attention to how you re talking to yourself, the more likely you are to slip into that other one you ve been using for a couple of decades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: So it s very much a conscious choice that I m going to choose this mentor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean it s my expectation but also my hope that this becomes more frequent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: And the more frequent it is, the easier it is to choose that path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I can tell when I m feeling like shit and things like going to a massage are the other voice, the third voice, the little devil chair on my shoulder saying, no, no, it ll be fine.
