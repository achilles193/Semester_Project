data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: How were your holidays?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Yeah. They were good, thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You go home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I went \u2013 Yeah, I went to \u2013 I have family in Vermont. And then, I went to Ohio for a bit to see some friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019ve been around a bit. Can we just look at the schedule real quick and chat about that then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. Did you get my e-mail?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I did, yeah. I didn\u2019t respond, \u2018cause I just figured we\u2019d chat about it today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So I had said, if it\u2019s \u2013 so I can do the 1:40 to 2:30. But if there was something a little earlier and you said that there was something at what time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that class I\u2019m teaching, it ends at \u2013 I stop teaching that the second week of February, so the 14th I\u2019m done teaching that class. And then, I\u2019m teaching another class starting two weeks later on Friday, but I think it is actually at 12:30. [1:27] That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. That\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">set in stone, but I\u2019m pretty sure. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. Wait \u2013 no, that\u2019s not right. It would be at 1:00. It would be at 1:00. So anyway, starting the 21st, I can start meeting at 11:45 on Fridays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Starting on \u2013 So for the 24th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Was it the 24th?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: The 24th is a Tuesday. So the 24th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Are you sure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Of January?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Oh, no, so February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Oh, we\u2019re looking into February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: So February 20 \u2013 I\u2019m not done with that class until February 14th. [2:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay, so you\u2019re not done until February 14th. Cool. So then, the 21st, you could start at \u2013 what time would be -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: 11:45.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: That would be \u2013 Yeah, so I\u2019m out at 10:50, 11:00. Let me put this in here. I don\u2019t want to forget 11:45, and that would go until 12:45. Sweet. Yeah that would be ideal, actually. [3:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: When do you start up classes again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I start Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Oh, you do. All right. And I know, by the way, I think starting \u2013 I think you said this doesn\u2019t work. But on Friday, starting the 17th of January on Friday I also have a 10:00 a.m.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I have a class at 10:00 a.m.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: So that doesn\u2019t work anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That doesn\u2019t work. Sweet. And we\u2019ll say that starting until the 21st, we\u2019ll keep this time. And then starting on Friday, February 21st, we\u2019ll do 11:45 to 12:35. Excellent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Okay. Good. [4:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Are you teaching another class, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s the thing that I should put a disclaimer, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Asterisk, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Is that my understanding is that it\u2019s at 1:00, but I haven\u2019t gotten that confirmed. Well, like I said in the e-mail. It would be cool but \u2013 It\u2019s that coordinating project thing I was talking about last semester. It\u2019s from like, 2:00 to 6:00. I kind of help people assemble their papers and stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">I mean, I could \u2013 If I was leaving here at 2:30 I could get there a little late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: A lot of people do that. So if it comes to \u2013 It\u2019s really not kind of an all or nothing type thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well, it works, that would be sweet. It\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s been a while, man. It\u2019s been two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can\u2019t even remember being in here two weeks ago. I haven\u2019t the slightest clue what we\u2019re even going to talk about. I had a dream. It must have definitely been after the last time that we met. But I actually did kind of a shouting out in my sleep thing. It happened \u2013 That had happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">a couple of times, maybe, since I moved into my new place. But it was always very kind of like, quiet. Sometimes I don\u2019t even think it woke Laney up. It was never like, the full scale kind of screaming, you know, close to at the top of my lungs. [6:12] I feel like that happened a bunch of times. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200512\">we talked about it when I was still at Providence College. But this time, it was really interesting. And I had an interesting conversation with Kaley (ph) about it that I wanted to share with you. My dream was that I was in my apartment in Belmont.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563319\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">And for a couple of days leading up to this, and since I got out of school and was on break. Laney was working a lot. And for the whole semester I really hadn\u2019t had any opportunity to clean the house or anything, which was really kind of frustrating. \u2018Cause I really like to keep the house clean. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">I spent a couple of days just really cleaning the house out. And it felt great. So this is just as a lead in to this dream, because it seems relevant. So in the dream, I was in the apartment. And I could kind of \u2013 In my dream it was relevant that I had just been cleaning it up a lot, you know what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">mean? And really kind of got it the way that I liked it. And my mom was in my apartment, and she \u2013 without even telling me, she rearranged everything by putting cabinets in different places and tables and chairs in different places. [7:38] And I saw it and I really didn\u2019t like it. It just looked bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200533\">in itself for one thing. And also it was just angering and frustrating that she did this again, without talking to me. And I told her about it and she kind of really took this really kind of paternalistic approach, just saying, no, it\u2019s better this way. You don\u2019t understand or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">And in my dream I remember I was just enraged. And I woke up, because what I screamed out was like, extremely clear. I screamed out, fuck you at the top of my lungs almost, which is interesting. \u2018Cause usually in the past, whenever I would do that, I would never really be articulating anything clear. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">It was always kind of, blaaah. You know what I mean? But this one, Laney woke up and she even kind of confirmed that it was crystal clear what I was saying. That at first, I don\u2019t even think that she thought I had said it in my sleep, just \u2018cause of how kind of clear it was. [8:57] It was odd. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200552\">at first, I just kind of brushed it off as another example of, you know, one more time that I kind of would yell stuff out in my sleep. And I was having a conversation with Kaley about it. We got together for dinner after New Year\u2019s. And she kind of just noted that in this dream, compared to my other <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200553\">ones in the past, which I had told her about \u2013 a number of them \u2013 and She seemed to have remembered them very clearly, which surprised me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">She kind of drew a distinction between in the past when I would be kind of yelling things out from like, a place of help \u2013 like powerlessness. You know, like hanging no a cliff and screaming out of fear or screaming in this weird person\u2019s face, \u2018cause I couldn\u2019t get my hands from behind my back and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">they were putting their face \u2013 you know what I mean? And in this situation, I was not only even in my kind of \u2013 where I have home court advantage or something, you could say. You know what I mean. I wasn\u2019t hanging from a cliff. I was in my apartment, a place that I feel really comfortable. And I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">was like, pushing back or something. You know what I mean? It just seems very different from just sort of screaming out of fear, as opposed to like \u2013 even just a clear message in anger as opposed to anger or something. And she just noted that very quickly. [10:51] I just thought it was very interesting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200573\">It didn\u2019t even really appear \u2013 It didn\u2019t occur to me at all. I just thought it was very interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563319\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What do you think of the shifts that she and you noted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well, we were talking about it kind of in the context of the holidays in the past. I had spoken with Kaley about \u2013 You know, I spoke with her a lot in the past about how I don\u2019t really enjoy doing family stuff in general, and particularly around the holidays. I don\u2019t really look forward to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">holidays, because it\u2019s really just a big kind of family time thing. She might have been one of the first people that I really spoke to about that. And I even kind of told her when we got together last week that \u2013 I think it was in a conversation with her that I kind of like, first kind of communicated <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">the fact that I actually don\u2019t like spending a lot of time with my family. I feel like Kaley has kind of a similar experience. [12:10] She kind of echoed that. And I think it was the first time that I really felt that that was something I could feel. That was a defensible position. It wasn\u2019t something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B3\">I had to hide. That\u2019s ground I could stand on and actually \u2013 without just being an immature little boy that just doesn\u2019t want to do what they\u2019re supposed to do or something. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">So we talk about this a lot. And it was within that kind of context talking about the holidays went by. I spent Christmas Eve at my apartment. Eric and Tommy came over and slept over. And Laney stuck around and some of my old roommates who were international students came by. And it was really nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">for Christmas Eve to do that. [13:04] And it also felt like an accomplishment, because I managed to push back on the family thing. I was able to kind of create a space outside of that which felt really good on that level. And then, I went up to New Hampshire for Christmas day. I took my mom\u2019s car up <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">and she hung out with my aunt in Newton. And I just went up for the day by myself. Even just for the afternoon. I got there about 1:00 or 2:00. We had dinner and then I left at like, 6:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Your mom didn\u2019t go up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: She stayed with my aunt in Newton. I ever tell you about Lola?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: She has some developmental issues. It\u2019s not Downs Syndrome. She hears voices and things like this. You speak with her for two minutes and it\u2019s very evident that she\u2019s working some stuff out. And she didn\u2019t want to go up to New Hampshire. My mom asked her if she wanted to go up with me and her, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">and she just said, no. [14:27] I always joke with my mom \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Schizophrenia?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: You know, I\u2019m really not sure. I\u2019m very curious. And I find it really weird, because I ask my mom this a lot. And my mom \u2013 you know, she deal with \u2013 She works with psychotic patients day in and day out. You know, she\u2019s not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but she\u2019s well-versed in these things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">And she seems to have no clear kind of label to put on it, which strikes me as really weird. I think she even said something one time like, the doctors that she goes to with Lola sometimes don\u2019t even really have a clear kind of categorization or something. But since she definitely has sometimes \u2013 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">know that she definitely goes through some like, manic episodes where she won\u2019t sleep for a while. And she\u2019ll be very tired sometimes. She definitely hears a lot of voices, and she\u2019s on a lot of medication and stuff. [15:34] My mom hung out with her. And yeah, I went up for a little while. It was nice. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200693\">It was nice to talk to my grandparents for a bit without my mom kind of breathing down my neck. And my aunt and my uncle came over, and my two cousins came over. Then it just got really frustrating, because \u2013 Beaver Cleaver family. Just kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563319\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. How do you find the \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: It just drives me crazy. I hate it. I can\u2019t stand it. They\u2019re just \u2013 And we\u2019ll be sitting at the table eating dinner and literally, my aunt and uncle will tell their kids what questions to ask their grandparents \u2013 our grandparents. Right in front of them. Right in front of the grandparents. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">Ask grandpa about this story from when he was growing up. [16:35] And then my cousin will be like, grandpa, tell me about that story. And sometimes I wonder what that looks like to my grandfather. Just stuff like this. And it\u2019s just so obnoxious to me. They\u2019re like \u2013 Barry\u2019s like 30. And my aunt does <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D2\">that to him. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: It seems to be \u2013 I mean, it seems to me that it\u2019s somehow linked to this idea or this sort of feeling of things being arranged a certain way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: I mean, it is \u2013 Yeah. There\u2019s a huge parallel between that dynamic with my mom in that dream. Like, I\u2019m just going to just completely determine what you do here. [17:33] You know what I mean? I do really think of it that way. I was really, really, really annoyed with just being in that group <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">of people on Christmas day. Maybe not any more than I have been in the past, but I really just kind of acknowledged it. And just made note of it in my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, when you talk about it, you really get right to a strong feeling that you become aware of. You become really \u2013 You find yourself frustrated by them. Kind of turned off sort of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know what it is. Sometimes I almost feel like it\u2019s just like trying to display like, how not a good grandson I am or something, you know. It just doesn\u2019t seem modest at all in a weird way. [18:55] It seems arrogant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Like they\u2019re \u2013 these very kind of demonstrations or performances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a huge performance. It\u2019s a very, very contrived type of performance in my opinion. I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s just horrible. Bad. Just toxic. Just the last type of thing I \u2013 (inaudible due to simultaneous dialogue at 19:55) In my family, I would do everything I can to \u2013 Those are the type <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">of people I feel I would do everything I can to avoid if they were in my family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: What are your grandparents like with the reaction to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: They\u2019re like grandparents. They\u2019re old. They don\u2019t hear super well. They seem to just not notice it I guess. I don\u2019t know. [20:36] They \u2013 when we\u2019re all sitting around the table, they don\u2019t seem to be up within the kind of boundaries of that dynamic. They seem to be kind of outside of it or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">something. They\u2019re very \u2013 just in general, very non-interventionist in a way. I haven\u2019t really said anything about her. (inaudible at 20:59) It\u2019s just very status quo. They all live there. I mean, they all live down the street from each other. It\u2019s not that they just do this stuff when I\u2019m there. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">has been, you know, their whole lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563319\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, it\u2019s not \u2013 I see the dynamic is that your grandparents aren\u2019t kind of expecting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Oh, I don\u2019t think that at all. It always seemed to me very much like the parents working out their own issues or something. [21:50] I don\u2019t understand how sometimes Barry and Melanie, my cousins don\u2019t just like, flip the dining room table and walk out. Fuck you with the I almost wanted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: We were talking about that kind of stuff. Talking about the fact that I just don\u2019t \u2013 I spend very little time with my dad. He came over to my place for the evening after work when Laney and I were home. Gave us some gifts and talked for a little while and he went home and that was it. That was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">our Christmas. So in a sense I feel like I kind of renegotiated the terms dictating this time of the year. In a way it left me feeling kind of good, you know. I felt like I had kind of accomplished something in my own sense. But that was the context that we were talking about. In that sense, I was oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">that really seems to make sense with all that. You know? Like, in the past, those dreams like, when I would wake up screaming were always very disturbing. I just kind of woke up and my heart was pounding, you know. Sweaty back or something. Sometimes I\u2019m fucking like in a pool of sweat. This time I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200833\">just didn\u2019t really \u2013 I didn\u2019t feel physically rattled at all. It wasn\u2019t a nightmare, you know. [23:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah. it\u2019s a lot less \u2013 I guess the word I was thinking about was perscatory (ph). It\u2019s more like you\u2019re much more feeling in touch with anger. Standing your ground of the sense of it being somewhat where you\u2019re able to assert your own ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: A sense of agency. Which I guess seems in a way \u2013 The lack of that is kind of a common thread in some of those other dreams I can remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting. I guess the image that came to mind about your cousins is kind of a \u2013 You\u2019re \u2013 as if you\u2019re seeing them as like \u2013 it being very choreographed and being puppets or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Very much so. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And if it\u2019s your aunt more than your uncle or your uncle more than your aunt. But in some way a puppeteered kind of manner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not stretching it at all. [25:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: And this is \u2013 your aunt is your mother\u2019s \u2013 Is it your aunt that\u2019s your mother\u2019s sister or you uncle that\u2019s your mother\u2019s brother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: My aunt.

Lola, she lives in like, government housing. She doesn\u2019t work or anything. You know, she\u2019s the only one who can afford a nice apartment in the Square, you know.

I didn\u2019t know it was that easy, though. I got a cat. Yeah. Laney and I got a cat on New Year\u2019s Eve. [26:07] I just felt that I had to mention that at least once. That\u2019s the big news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Tell me about it. How did you guys -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: We went down to the shelter and we just saw him. We had been talking about getting a cat for a while, and then a few hours later we were home with the cat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: What kind? Old?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Seven years old. Kind of a short-haired gray cat. Very friendly. A little old. Got surrendered by someone else in December. We just took him home. It was cool. It\u2019s a good feeling to have a third being in the house. [26:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s cool. It feels like having a kid or something, maybe. Yeah, you got to think about feeding this thing every night. It\u2019s funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Male or female?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a female. Named her Delilah. We didn\u2019t know what her name was before. So we named her Delilah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Where\u2019d the name come from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Laney\u2019s mom suggested it. I thought, that\u2019s a cool name. I like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s Laney\u2019s background? Maybe you told me this. I forgot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: She had a \u2013 technically, it\u2019s Portuguese and Italian. They don\u2019t have any attachment to that stuff. I mean, they don\u2019t have any kind of a cultural traditions associated with it or anything. Another thing I did over break I did last night. I wrote a letter to my grandmother in Wales, actually. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">[28:16] It\u2019s kind of weird that I decided to do that. And I did it kind of on my own volition. I was talking with my dad. My dad hasn\u2019t talked to her. I don\u2019t even know when the last time he spoke to her was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he hadn\u2019t talked to her since we were both talking about \u2013 since I was in the 7th grade. It could have been that long. I mean, he speaks sometimes to one of his brothers and he\u2019ll get word that she\u2019s alive, I guess. But I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s never <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">mentioned to me that he\u2019s spoken with her. Isla, Reese\u2019s (sp) mother, my sister, moved to Edinburgh right after the wedding this summer to be near Reese, from Wales. And she just moved back to Wales. I have no idea why she left Edinburgh so quickly. [29:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: But she was there less than six months?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Much less. Who knows why. But Isla moved back to Wales, but not to the part of Wales where she lived before. She moved where all my father\u2019s family is. I guess she had a friend there. And she ran into my grandma, my dad was telling me. And she wrote a letter to my dad saying \u2013 or she wrote <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">an e-mail saying, I saw your mom. I guess in the correspondence she mentioned my grandma was asking about Reese and I. My dad mentioned that to me and I just said to him like, you know, maybe I\u2019ll just write her a letter. And I just asked my dad for her address and he gave it to me. Yeah. I wrote her <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB2\">a letter last night. It was interesting. [30:26] It\u2019s kind of weird that I decided to do that on my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I always say that if I could do anything I want, I would never talk to any of my family again. I feel like I say that a lot. And here I am. My father would certainly never ask me to contact her the way that my mom would ask me to contact my family in New Hampshire.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563319\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: What did you write?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: I just said \u2013 It was kind of weird when I started writing, because I was just like \u2013 I told her, this is Robbie\u2019s (ph) son, Geoffrey from America. I just wanted to \u2013 we haven\u2019t spoken or seen each other in a long time. I just told her I wanted to say, hi. Connect with you. I told her I\u2019m 28. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C31\">She probably has no idea. Told her I\u2019m in school and I\u2019m dating a girl named Laney. That I live in Providence. I didn\u2019t really know how to end it. I just kind of wrote, you know, it\u2019s been a very long time since we spoke. I just wanted to, you know, let you know that I think about you and I have warm <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C32\">memories of you from when I was much younger. [32:08] I was writing it, and I was kind of like, I remember I wrote that and I was thinking about it and in a way you can almost just say, you know, just be like, I just wanted to write you to differentiate me from my dad in your mind or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: My dad probably isn\u2019t too concerned with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Differentiate yourself \u2013 In what way were you thinking from your dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: My dad knows she\u2019s there and chooses not to be connected with her, you know. You would have to be able to assume that I wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for coming to the conclusion that, you know, he just didn\u2019t care about his relationship or something with her or her feelings about what that must be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">to not speak to her son or something. [33:30] I put some pictures in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Of me. I assume if she saw me she wouldn\u2019t recognize me if I walked into the same room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I bet<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: I probably would recognize her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Did you send one of you and Laney?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I sent \u2013 all the pictures I have are of Laney and I. So I sent those. [34:08] I didn\u2019t mention my dad once. I didn\u2019t write the word dad once. I kind of noticed afterwards. That felt kind of good to do that. I clearly wanted to do it enough to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It seems also like there\u2019s a contrast here between this \u2013 the way you\u2019re describing your family in New Hampshire and you\u2019re reaching out to your \u2013 Almost like there\u2019s something kind of like almost a responsibility to your New Hampshire family you have to do it. But then saying that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">was the kind of way you felt after you took the initiative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: There\u2019s definitely inverse between those two things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You know, the way I was thinking about it is that in some way, it seems like it\u2019s, you know, these two kind of ways of \u2013 these two kind of sides of relating to family. You know, on the one hand, you not wanting to feel like, you know, pushed into doing it, but that not meaning you don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">want to have contact in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: The fact that was really interesting, I really liked being up in New Hampshire until my aunt and uncle got up there. When it was just my grandma and my grandpa and I sitting around and talking we had a very nice conversation. I felt like it. I was enjoying it. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And you wanted to see them? Did you feel like you wanted to -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: I wanted to keep doing that conversation. [36:38] I was enjoying it and it\u2019s kind of a rarity. I need to go to the bathroom real quick. I will say though, that I don\u2019t like the idea that I don\u2019t want to do stuff in New Hampshire because my mom tells me to do it, but I do want to get to know <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">my grandma, because no one tells me to do it. [39:26] As if it could be compared to a kid who doesn\u2019t want to do their homework because their parents told them to do their homework, you know. Once their parents tell them to do something, then they don\u2019t want to do it. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563319\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There\u2019s a way that you kind of feel like it\u2019s reduced to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It just feels infantile. It just doesn\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want it to be just a feature of something like that. [40:00] It doesn\u2019t \u2013 It seems reactionary. It doesn\u2019t seem \u2013 I\u2019d like to see there\u2019s something more there or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You know, in one way, I think that\u2019s a way you\u2019ve described you\u2019ve come to feel that response you had to, you know, some kind of feeling you\u2019ve had about this \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s control or kind of strings or something. Like, it\u2019s almost like you feel like, well, if I was just kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">of mature or whatever, I\u2019d be it wouldn\u2019t wrangle me. But I think what you\u2019re sort of saying is, what I\u2019m struck by is that there is this very important kind of response to this feeling of things being arranged and choreographed in a certain way that means a lot to you. That has a lot of deep, really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E92\">is \u2013 There\u2019s like a really deep response to that. [41:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: No, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And I hear what you\u2019re saying. In a way, you\u2019ve kind of been, and one way you\u2019ve come to understand it is being kind of stubborn and I don\u2019t want to be told what to do. And certainly, there\u2019s an element. I mean, it starts to be like there\u2019s this element of it \u2013 Part of the description being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">somebody being told what to do. But it seems to me like there\u2019s a lot more to unpack from that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: I guess I hope \u2013 I hope so. There\u2019s no doubt that it definitely really impacts me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Just the reaction of the \u2013 what the \u2013 your aunt and uncle and the kids, your cousins reacting in that setting. It wasn\u2019t you that was being, you know \u2013 the strings weren\u2019t being pulled on you, but you could see it right in front of you. It\u2019s really strong. Brought some strong feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">for you. And in fact, in some ways it really \u2013 It sounded like to me, it was like, almost like they were sort of \u2013 I was imagining you feeling like they were rubbing it in your face a little bit. Like hey, this is how you treat grandparents, don\u2019t you know? [43:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. They weren\u2019t like, doing it to me, but it \u2013 I felt like I then was subject to those terms that were being laid out in front of me or something. I guess I, you know, when I found myself in this kind of position, you know, I thought how defensible is it. How could I justify this. You know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">Sometimes I feel like it just comes down \u2013 I worry that it\u2019s just something like don\u2019t want to do what I\u2019m told or something. You know how you get uncomfortable and second guess it. You know what I mean? [44:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: I mean, it says nothing about how it makes me feel good. That\u2019s not in question. Like, it felt good to reduce the amount of stuff that I did and it felt good to write that letter to my grandma, you know. But it\u2019s an entirely different question of to justify an item and equating that with being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">correct or something. You know what I mean?

You know. Feel great to punch certain people in the face or something. It\u2019s not a reason for doing it per se. It was definitely a better holiday season, though. That goes without saying. It definitely goes without saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Very interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Reaching out to your grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: And the extent to which I feel less my parents pulling on me in either direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: Yeah. They were both cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: These very minimal things. A couple of years ago it would have kind of been scandalous. I have to assume there\u2019s something there, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s something about standing your ground or that dream being a reflection of a kind of a change that\u2019s kind of occurred among all of you and yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: I like that. I\u2019d be happy to have some of those dreams. I\u2019d take them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You really put a voice to it. I\u2019m struck too by the fact that there were words and feelings that were more embodied in the dream as opposed to \u2013 I remember, you know, some of the \u2013 at least my memory of some of the descriptions of the dreams \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what you were yelling or even <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D1\">feeling that you were being heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CILENT: No. Yeah, all those things, yeah. Very different in that sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: Hanging. Groundless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. Hanging off the cliff. Yeah. [47:13] Plenty to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: Okay, we\u2019ll pick up next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: Next Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019ll see you at this time. Yeah. Back to the 1:40 time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Is there like a $50 yearly deductible with this thing with the new year that you\u2019re going to need?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know.

Well, just let me know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: With you guys, I bet they do it by the academic year. I bet they don\u2019t do it by calendar year. They might, though. But, yeah, I will let you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah. Absolutely.
