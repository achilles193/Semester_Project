(Pause) Let's see. [0:00:52] I was thinking about what you said the previous time about (pause), I think, idealizing people, but I was wondering, like, I guess that is some... that can be nice and comforting, but it can also... it leads to problems, right, if you idealize <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">friends and then if they mess up, then that can... I mean, why would someone want to be idealized? They might find it very restricting, I guess? I don't know. Maybe, I'm wondering if, for example, my mom idealizes me, and then I might feel too tied to her image of me and too afraid to make mistakes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">And when I do make mistakes I feel doubly bad, I guess, for letting her down, I guess? I don't know. [0:02:14] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So you imagine that the other person would feel pressure to live up to your expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I suppose, yeah. I mean, maybe that's what I did with Victor (sp?), and maybe he sensed it and didn't want to have that, you know? Yeah, I don't know (chuckling). [0:02:59] (Pause) I don't think I idealize Chris (sp?). I don't know, do you think I idealize him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: You might (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: [I think so] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: How are you feeling you don't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Well, because I see it as mistakes, and I get mad (chuckling), so... [0:03:59] I do maybe idealize them like, if he's very intelligent and everything. But I also see his fault at the same time, and... yeah. I'm not sure if I idealize them (chuckling). I'm confused now. (Pause) Do you think he's <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">right for me, or if that's the right question to ask?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don't know. We keep fighting, and it really upsets me. I mean, he's able to work, but I'm not. And I cannot afford to even pause for, like, a day. I have so many deadlines and so much to do. [0:05:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Are you in contact with him a lot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: With who?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Victor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: No, Chris, Chris, sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Chris.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Is that who you're talking about idealizing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I was talking about both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Sorry, I keep switching. I said first that I did idealize Victor and ignored his faults. But then I asked you if you think I idealize Chris.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, I would change my answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't idealize him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: It seems like you idealize parts of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, but... yes, that's what I said because I can see his faults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: But not like Victor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And then I asked you if you think Chris is right for me (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I see. I was confused. [0:05:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I keep switching between the two like that (chuckling). It's what is in my mind, so... (Pause) So do you think Chris is right, or should I rephrase the question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess that implicit in the question is that I would know what's right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Well, just as, I guess, an impartial, unbiased person who has perhaps a good overview of what's going on, you know (chuckling)? So doesn't get bogged down in the details like I would because I'm so close to the situation, so... (Pause) He and I keep fighting, so it's not, I don't know... I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200531\">seem to get anywhere. [0:07:03] And people tell us that, you know, you need to take a break from each other, because anyone would say that who knows what's happened. I mean, [Chris and I] (ph) recognize] that we're both like, yeah, if it were any other couple, they would have broken up long ago, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200532\">it's not... I mean, we know that we're unable to take this decision, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559350\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: What do you guys fight about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Mostly the physical stuff, yeah. Like, if it works, then it's fine, but if it doesn't work then Chris is all... it becomes an existential question for him, like, oh, you know, we shouldn't be together. [0:08:04] I don't find you attractive anymore, I guess. That's a problem. And then I'm like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">wait, but you did when it worked, you know? And then, like, the thing that we haven't actually been able to have sex makes it even worse in his mind. I don't know, I'm just really confused. I feel like I don't have to... like, I can have a sexless relationship. Sometimes I feel like that, other times <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">I don't. I don't know (chuckling). Sometimes I feel like I maybe shouldn't even be in a relationship because it takes so much away from stuff that I really want to do. [0:09:00] But then I get bored (chuckling) and afraid that nothing good is happening to me. I have [no one] (ph), you know? But I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200573\">like that in the crowd, too, so (chuckling, sniffing)... so I'm not really sure. (Pause) [0:09:58] But you agree that, like, any other couple would have walked away from each other long ago, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: When did I agree to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, I'm just asking, would you agree, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Why is that inevitable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Inevitable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, you said any other couple. It sounds like that would be inevitable for other couples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: We just assume that others are stronger than we are (chuckling). Other people are stronger, more rational, or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: People stay in really, really awful relationships, really awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but why? Like, for kids (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I think there are very complicated psychological reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: And ours is not that bad, right (chuckling)? You don't think? [0:10:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: It seems like you really almost want me to tell you what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). I mean, you don't have to tell me what to do but help me sort through the mess<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">(chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Oh, I'll certainly help you sort through, and I certainly want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: But that (ph) question of, you know, is Chris right for me, is not helping you sort through the mess. It's me giving you a response to what you should do, in a sense. I mean, obviously if I said, you know, Chris is right for you, then I guess that would guide you to a particular path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Do you... is it sort of a relief if someone else made the decision, or do you feel not confident in your own abilities to make a decision?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: (Sniffing) I don't know. (Pause) [0:11:56] I'm sure I don't feel confident, but I just don't want... I don't know. (Pause) Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's so much about the decision as it is about desiring the larger perspective, you know? And someone else's opinion would probably say something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200811\">like, you know, I've seen you guys together, and this is what people say. But you don't, you know, look like a couple. Or you look more like good friends. Or... and this is what people say all the time anyways. [0:13:02] Or someone to (ph) say, well, you know, I know you very well, and you seem to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200812\">best when you have this, this, and this in your life but not that. Or, you know, you guys should do this, like, such as, I don't know... take a break or whatever, and see how it goes. Or... yeah, I don't know (chuckling). I guess that's what I'm looking for (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559350\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Advice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, ultimately, I know I'll make my own decision, but I would... if there isn't I'll do it. I doubt it (chuckling). We've dragged it on for so long, but... [0:14:03] (Pause) (Sniffing) Like for me unfortunately I go from one extreme to the other a lot, and that makes things difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">for everyone around me (chuckling). And I don't have a very good grasp on reality, so... [0:15:08] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Like I'll say stuff like, oh, I can live without X or Y or just make claims like that and... without ever pausing and thinking, is this really true? You know, let me sit down and look at my past behavior and see if that's true, if that holds true, but I don't do that. And I make no plans, so... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">(Pause) But... [0:15:57] (Pause) Like I cannot even decide whether I find Chris attractive or not. I mean, is it that difficult to decide? Shouldn't it be like a simple yes or no (chuckling)? Isn't it for other people, like, you're either attracted to someone or you're not (chuckling)? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: It's hard to answer your questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Why (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Because you sort of put every other person in a category of relatively normal...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: And then you... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Is that not normal (laughing)? I don't know. I assume other people probably think like that, too. [0:17:01] (Pause) Well, like, okay, so if we don't [want to] (ph) know about other people, then, at least for me, I'll say it's hard for me to decide whether I find Chris attractive or not, that's all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">(Phone ringing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) But I guess it makes sense because he's no longer just, like, a photo on a page, you know? I've known him for so long, so obviously there's a lot of affection, etc. (Pause) [0:17:58] Do you think I go from one extreme to the other? Have you noticed that in me, or am I just making that up (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I can try to answer that, but a lot of your questions are going in a direction, it's like you're (ph)... I want to try to help sort of understand what you're looking for in those questions. It's kind of like your statement that you don't have a grasp on reality. Like, maybe you feel that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">you're so, kind of, immersed in your own thoughts and feelings, it's hard to see out of that for a different kind of perspective. [0:18:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Probably. Yeah, that's right (chuckling). How do I snap out of...? I try to, but it's hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well, it's hard to snap out of your thoughts and feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Why do you want to snap out of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: I just feel they can become damaging at some point.

Do you think I'll ever find it (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I think you can get certainly some of this disentangled. That's why you're here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: And it seems like this issue of making a decision about Chris is particularly pressing these days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: I'm totally okay with just coasting along, you know? [0:20:58] But then, if he gets intimate and I don't deliver or whatever, then he becomes very kind of angry, and... yeah, and then he's all about, should we be together or not? And I'm like, whoa, you know? Another guy who's ready to throw me out (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: That's what it feels like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it feels like, great, I'm sexually suppressed [as Victor said] (ph), so I have to suffer for things that are not my fault. That's why I felt so strongly... I thought it was unjust of him to have suggested that and thrown me out because of that reason, because I feel like, but that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">not my fault, you know? It's not my fault that I'm suppressed, you know? Shouldn't I get a chance with someone like him, who can bring it out or whatever, a normal relationship, you know? [0:22:05] So I felt like he was being very unjust (chuckling). But that's in the past, but... (Pause) [0:22:58] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C12\">I mean, it seems like a big deal that suddenly I have become unattractive in a certain situation to Chris. So I feel very worried (chuckling), and then, on the one hand, I'm like, okay, this is worrying. I should focus on being attractive or whatever. And not just physically, like, whatever that makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C13\">a person attractive. And then, on the other hand, I'm like, why the hell should I bother when it's too much work, you know? Maybe I should just be single because I really don't... I mean, I've wasted so many years of my life, I feel, just worrying about him and making sure he's happy in every way and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C14\">(chuckling)... it's too much work. [0:24:02] (Pause) [0:24:58] (Pause) [0:25:57] I'm sort of lost in my thoughts (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah? Where did you go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: It's really frustrating, this whole thing, so... I just feel like I'm at the point where I just want to tell him that, you know, I don't want to see you any more (chuckling). [0:27:06] That's something that would work for more than 12 hours (chuckling). So... (Pause) Like, why is it so difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">to have sex? I mean, is that normal? Again, you don't have to answer that one, but why is it so difficult (chuckling)? [0:28:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: That's a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Chris thinks that we care about each other too much to want to hurt each other (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: What does sex have to do with hurting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Well, just the actual physical pain that is going... I'm going to feel, you know?

[0:28:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Because we've tried, and it doesn't work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: What doesn't work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: I feel pain, and he stops (chuckling). So... yeah, I mean... (Pause) And he says it's okay and that it's been okay all these years, but I doubt that very much because that probably means that he is dissatisfied, right, even though he might not say that he is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Are you scared?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: What are you scared of? [0:30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Of the pain (chuckling), of wanting to give... like, subject myself to it (chuckling) for Chris's sake, you know? But I feel like [if it has] (ph) to be any guy, it shouldn't be Chris because we've been together for so long, and he's done so much for me. So I should feel that gratitude and let him, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Do you feel aroused when you're passionate with him or intimate with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: I didn't use to that much, but now I'm starting to. Like, it didn't use to work until he started really stimulating me. But with Victor it was much better because... I don't know why. [0:31:05] But with Chris as of late I've started to feel that a little bit more. Not all the time, but... (Sniffing) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">(Pause) Yeah, I don't know. Like, Saturday night he took me out to dinner, and then he bought me flowers as well. So all that should have made me feel like, I don't know, something (chuckling). [0:31:57] But it didn't, and maybe I ate too much food (laughing), so I felt conscious of my body. But I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F12\">know. Yeah. And he, I guess, was expecting something, and it didn't work. So he just was like... he lost interest. He was like, fine, just go to bed. But even though he might not say that he is upset or disappointed, I know he feels it, and it comes across in his behavior. And that really worries me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F13\">It shouldn't. I try not to think about it, but my mind goes back there. And I feel anxious, and I want to make it go away or make it better as quickly as I can. [0:32:59] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">And, like, with Victor... but Chris might say that was just like for... the initial days of any relationship are going to be... you're going to be attracted to each other no matter what. You don't have to do anything. Maybe that is true, but he didn't have to do anything, I don't think. He didn't even <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F31\">take me out to dinner once (laughing). We went out once, but we split the bill. Yeah, and no flowers. I would buy him so many things. He didn't buy me much of anything. In fact on my birthday, he said he didn't feel like doing anything. [0:33:56] He's like, I didn't do anything for Chris's birthday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F32\">so I don't feel like doing anything for your birthday. And I was very, very upset, but I somehow let that go. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: How did you let it go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: How did you let it go? Sounds like it was hurtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I couldn't do anything, right? I mean, he didn't... Chris was around, first of all, so I couldn't just see Victor. And, yeah, I couldn't do anything about it (chuckling), so I had no choice. But physically with him, it was always like I felt I was right there all the time. Just the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB1\">way he would pay attention to me, you know? I just felt wanted and loved. [0:34:56] But not so much with Chris, he's very different. He's very cerebral (chuckling), and I have to be really, like... yeah, think of very creative ways and really make it special. I feel like I have to do a lot of the work <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB2\">(chuckling). But with Victor I didn't have to do much of anything, so... and I'm just stating experience with Victor not because I desire it any more. It's just another reference point in my head, and I'm like, hmm, you know? What's going on with Chris and me? [0:35:56] (Pause) I'm just not making any <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB3\">progress (chuckling).

I just feel like I'm running around in circles (chuckling). I just feel ridiculous because I'm so afraid to take any decision. It's just weird. I used to be a lot less afraid when I was younger. Now obviously, so... I tried to break up with Chris so many times (chuckling). Even as early <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF1\">as, like, when we just met, and I had so many doubts. And one time I was feeling very definite that I wanted to break up. [0:39:02] And this was right after I'd met his parents and felt really scared by his mom. But then he came... like, he drove all the way and was, in (ph) talking to my mom, talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF2\">to me, like, no, don't punish me for the way that my mom is (chuckling), all that, and...

[0:40:57] (Pause) Yeah, I don't know if there's a resolution, if I'll ever find it by myself (chuckling).

I don't know why this happened (chuckling). (Pause) [0:43:02] (Chuckling) Basically, I don't know what I want. I think that's the problem.
