There we go. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: So I don\u2019t remember if I mentioned this last week, but I failed my state inspection for my car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh, no. I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Which is a pain in the butt, because they are making me \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to go back to the same place, because they talked about oh, the tints are too dark in the back, which is not something I got last year. And the car came like that from Alabama, but whatever. Maybe the standards <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">in Alabama are different than here. And they\u2019re like, and the two front tires need replacing. Well actually, all of them need replacing, but the two front ones really need it. And because they need it and because your light and your wiper blades need it that we\u2019re going to have to put down the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: You did tell me this. Yeah. Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: So now I\u2019m just a little bit stressed because tires \u2013 Well, I found a cheap deal like alignment and two tires. Like, okay I can afford it, but I\u2019ll have to wait until my next paycheck.  I\u2019m just sick of living this tight. You know? Like, also I have to pay for the malpractice insurance. I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">been putting that off, because if I want to do any kind of independent work, I need to do that. Just like, everything costs money. And I\u2019m so tight, and I hate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Do you get your \u2013 You\u2019re insured is through GWU (ph). Is that how it works?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But everyone keeps telling me it\u2019s good to have extra. And then if I want to do anything else, you know, like private patients I\u2019m obviously going to need it. So it\u2019s just a pain. And that \u2013 I\u2019m driving over here and I\u2019m thinking I feel bad that I\u2019m behind on my payment. Like, that\u2019s always <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">\u2013 I think it\u2019s always on the back of my mind here. And like, it\u2019s coming to the end of the year at my work. Well, we do a lot of terminations. Like, it\u2019s just a whole different system.  You know, it\u2019s short-term. Get in, get out. And I feel like I\u2019m \u2013 I know that this is a different setting and we could <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">do long-term work. But sometimes I start questioning like, well where can I cut corners? What can I do? Do I really need therapy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I guess I don\u2019t really need therapy, but I feel like I\u2019ve grown so much just as a person and people even tell me this. Like, Brian tells me. My friends tell me. I get positive feedback from supervisors just about my own self-awareness. And I feel like part of that has been because of the work I\u2019ve done <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">in here. And I feel like I\u2019d be able to survive, but it keeps me sane. It just \u2013 and there\u2019s been really bad times that, thank God I have this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re sort of like, maybe one the idea about cutting back might come from a lot of places, but I wonder if it comes in one respect from some feeling that comes up around not being behind or not paying in full or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. Again, it\u2019s that feeling of like, well I\u2019m sure he has a lot of other clients who have no problem paying on time. And it\u2019s like, oh, here comes Melanie (sp) again who\u2019s really behind. I think it\u2019s just on my mind, because I\u2019m going to have a lunch meeting with a friend tomorrow, a colleague. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">And I\u2019m going to ask her about private practice since she just started having a few people. And I\u2019m going to ask questions like, well, what you do if someone can\u2019t pay. And then I start thinking about myself. You know? And obviously, you have a different situation, because I think you do this mostly. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">Like, you probably do the supervision, too. But like, you don\u2019t do what I would do, like I\u2019m your only patient. That\u2019s not the case. That\u2019s very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: No. I\u2019m exclusively in private practice or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So it\u2019s I guess one patient out of the bunch wouldn\u2019t be so much of a burden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I just feel bad. I feel bad that I can\u2019t \u2013 that every time I give you a check it\u2019s a measly $50 check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Well, what do you notice? What\u2019s the bad feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t notice anything from you. It\u2019s all coming from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: No. No. Yeah. What are you see in that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like a burden. \u2018Cause it\u2019s not like you\u2019re my friend or you like hearing me talk necessarily, you know. It\u2019s like this is your job. So if I\u2019m not giving you something in return, I wonder if sometimes it might feel like a burden. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I see. Well, you know, I guess one thing that I\u2019m thinking about is think one thing I feel is that you don\u2019t feel right now, with me at least that you\u2019re doing the thing that you do with so many other people in your life. You know, like you\u2019re the one making sure that you\u2019re on top of things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">responsible in that way. And when you\u2019re not, some sort of something else enters in. This other side, you know, almost like it\u2019s the way in which some way you can start to feel a little bit of something in some way that you\u2019re not doing what I\u2019m expecting or something like that. And that\u2019s how you \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: No. You\u2019re so right. \u2018Cause I\u2019m just thinking about work. And I am a step ahead of my boss. Today he came in and he\u2019s like, oh Melanie I was just wondering \u2013 \u2018cause one of my clients got hospitalized over the weekend. I had already called the hospital. I had already talked to the person that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">did the hospitalization this weekend. So when he came into my office, I already knew what to tell him. And before I left, a social worker called me and said, oh by the way, they found a bed in this hospital. That\u2019s where he is. Quickly sent an e-mail. Boss, just an update. You know I\u2019m on top of it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">And you\u2019re right. And I\u2019m on top of everything else. But, you know, I\u2019m not behind on my bills except for this. And I get so much from this and it just feels like you\u2019re giving me a break and it doesn\u2019t feel fair in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah, is there anything that doesn\u2019t feel fair about it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, nobody else will work with you like this. Look at my situation with Sallie Mae. You know, if I don\u2019t have $700 in my account on the 30th when they take it out \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well, they did work with you, though. I mean, what\u2019s funny is they did. Yeah. At the end there\u2019s something that feels different about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLEINT: Yeah. I mean, they worked with me but they were so cold and rigid. And it\u2019s a different experience with you and that feels different. That it doesn\u2019t feel that awkward when you have to talk about payment. That\u2019s a new experience. (pause) I\u2019m not complaining. It just feels new. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You\u2019re wondering, too how you would do it with your patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I\u2019m starting to think about that, too. But I don\u2019t know. Maybe there\u2019s a fear also that one day you\u2019re going to tell me that, I think you\u2019re good. You know, I had a client today just at 3:00 and we found our piece of work and there was nothing left to talk about. And she was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">well do you think I need to continue. And I was like, of course. Everyone could benefit, but as far as our piece of work goes, you\u2019ve reached your goal. You\u2019re good to go. But it\u2019s a different system. We do short-term work and that\u2019s it. You\u2019re done. This just happened on the way here driving over here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">And I was like, am I done? Am I taking too much, or is this how it works? I mean, of course this is how it works. I have friends who have been in therapy for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: You know, but tell me more about the feeling of what\u2019s being done to you? What do you notice? I mean, in other words maybe you\u2019re sort of saying it\u2019s not necessarily just kind of like something that you start to think, because of the kind of the \u2013 maybe the anxiety about having a balance <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">or something. You\u2019re sort of saying this is a way to justify, hey, I don\u2019t need it. I can cut back now. But you\u2019re saying maybe it\u2019s something more to that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: You know what I think it is? And this is just a theory, but I\u2019m putting it out there. I think I needed you the most I\u2019ve ever needed you a month ago when I called you. And I\u2019m feeling guilt or something about okay, now I\u2019m doing better. Look, I\u2019m calm. I\u2019ve taken too much. I\u2019ve put him out. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">Maybe it has something to do with that. That just came to me. \u2018Cause that was only a month ago. Like, I did feel like, wow. Thank God I have a therapist. I really needed him. He was there for me. That helped. That got me through that difficult time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting though that it\u2019s not just that, you know, you could see it in two ways. You could see it yeah, as a response to some of the anxiety you might feel about having gone there with me, you know. And that maybe in some way it shuts that down. Okay. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay, don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">worry. But in a way it\u2019s interesting too, to think about it in terms of something that you did do when you called me. Something that was a piece of work that we were working on together. And as much as you felt like okay, hey, I\u2019m going to show you something of what I\u2019m really struggling with. I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">to let you know. I\u2019m not going to \u2013 you know, you calling me when I was on vacation, right? And feeling okay, well I need to do that. It\u2019s not that it can\u2019t wait. I need to be able to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to just be the good patient. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) If I\u2019m doing that it\u2019s unconscious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, not to say that that was like a motivation as much as maybe that\u2019s all the meaning it\u2019s held for you. And well, I don\u2019t know, I mean that\u2019s the way I kind of think about it. In one way I\u2019m thinking about how it is like, that was \u2013 there\u2019s something noteworthy about you, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">know, being comfortable enough to get uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, for a few days. Remember, James and my friend Carly kept telling me you should call, you should call. And I held off for a few days. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you wonder if that\u2019s something to do with it. This whole \u2013 that whole \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: I had a really, really good weekend. I spent some time with friends on Friday and I had my first beer with my burger, and it went well and I felt fine about it. And we went to a bar afterwards. And my friend Patrice doesn\u2019t even drink, because she\u2019s on all these medications and she just had <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">vocal cord surgery. So she just doesn\u2019t drink alcohol. So it feels normal to be in there with water, so I didn\u2019t even think twice about it and just had water and hung out with them and laughed a lot, and made a lot of plans for the summer which got me just excited about life and feeling connected to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">people. Like, we already planned a little day trip. My friend Emma, who\u2019s a lawyer, she has a condo with a pool, so we were like, we\u2019re hitting that spot this summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">And on Saturday I went for a little jog and I ran into \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you know Tracy Hopper (sp). So we\u2019ve been talking, just consulting about a client, and next thing you know we kind of \u2013 she came in once for training about how to do private practice. And then, when we consulted over the phone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">we kind of hit it off more socially. And she\u2019s like, we should just go get coffee. Yeah, we should go get a coffee. And then suddenly we ran into each other and she was with her baby and her dog. And it was so nice. We walked for a good 20 minutes together and ended up finding out that we\u2019re neighbors <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">and we\u2019re going to go on a coffee date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">So it\u2019s just like, I love all these connections I\u2019m making with people up here. I think about how my life used to be in Alabama, and yeah, I had some friends, but I don\u2019t know. The relationships I\u2019ve made up here feel a lot deeper and meaningful. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just that I\u2019m in a different place <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">in my life or what. So that was nice, and I was in a good mood all weekend. Brian\u2019s been good. I feel it\u2019s like we\u2019re more connected than ever. It\u2019s been really sweet and nice. I found out something that again, should have upset me, but I think I\u2019m still kind of processing it, but at the same time compartmentalizing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">it and putting it on another side of my head. So remember how I wrote this girl on Facebook. I created a fake account. She wrote back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: She did, yeah. Last time, last week she hadn\u2019t yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: No. It took her a while. And she wrote back and she said I\u2019m so sorry. It seems like since you\u2019re not my friend on Facebook it went to a different mailbox. Oh, but yes, I do remember that guy and this was almost exactly a year ago that this happened and I have not been in touch with him. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">I started doing the math in my head and I\u2019m like, okay. She responded on Monday, I think. So I was thinking okay, Monday last year what was going on. I know that my little sister, Sasha visited us in April or May. He took us out to dinner. I\u2019m like, were we fighting back then? Was I dating someone else? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">I wasn\u2019t. And the first thought is like, what a bastard. Like, we were getting along. I don\u2019t think at that point I had started dating anyone else. So he was already sleeping with someone else. But then I started thinking back. When was that drunken incident when I was sitting on his doorstep?  And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200593\">he mentioned once that it was in October. And I\u2019m trying to think back. Was it this October or was it last October? Do you remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You know, my own \u2013 when I was thinking about it I thought it was sometime summer of \u201813. But I don\u2019t remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Was I in post doc?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. I thought it was the summer, though. Anyway. I mean the summer of last year, so I think it was like within \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: So I was trying to make sense of it in my head. Like, could that drunken incident have happened and then he cheated and that\u2019s why he cheated? But I didn\u2019t dig too deep trying to find out when did this happen, when did I mess up. I was trying to find blame for myself, you know. Did I do something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">to cause this? But that didn\u2019t last too long. And then what she said was a little disturbing, but I think I\u2019m disturbed that I\u2019m not that disturbed about it. So she had nothing but really negative things to say about him. She said, I agreed to play with him once and he was a real asshole. He shamed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">me for using my safe word. He\u2019s not involved in the kink community, because no one would ever put up with his garbage. No one would, because someone would call him out on the way he pushes boundaries. And she said he\u2019s not a dom, I guess that\u2019s what they call when you\u2019re like the, like in S&amp;M when you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200613\">the one \u2013the sadistic one or whatever. And she said he\u2019s a misogynist and he said that he likes to get little young college girls and do these things to them and get them to like him and want to continue to be with him and then just blow them off. Did you have a negative experience like I did with him? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200614\">Please let me know if you want to talk. And like, right away I felt oh, my God. Did she have a really terrible experience like she felt violated? I work with girls who go through this stuff.  And I wrote her back saying, I\u2019m so sorry. It sounds like you had a really negative experience. I\u2019m sorry that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200615\">you got hurt like that. No, I\u2019m fine. Nothing like that has happened. Where did you guys meet? Was this in a hotel room? Was it just once? And she said yeah, we met online. It was just once in a hotel room. And the last time I spoke to him I told him what a shitty person he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">And then, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m trying to justify this or what, but if I were to say this to Brian, I know that he would say that\u2019s total bullshit. First of all, the thing he told me about this girl was that she claimed to be in the kink community and that she was a total \u2013 I don\u2019t even \u2013 I\u2019m blanking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">out on the terms and I don\u2019t know if this is telling that I\u2019m blanking out Submissive. He said she was so full of it. She thought I was gentle with her, much gentler than I am with you. And she was totally over it. She didn\u2019t want to do it and we only hooked up once. So he was telling the truth about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">that. And I know that he made her write the letter, the thing she wrote before and then after. And after, when I read the note again it said like, even though I screamed and I protested I loved every minute of it, because I\u2019m a fucking whore. And I know that if I confronted him about it, he would be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200633\">like, Melanie, she was coming her brains out. Like, there\u2019s no way she didn\u2019t enjoy that, even if afterwards \u2013 He used to tell me that like, a lot of girls sometimes would kind of stop calling him or stop hooking up after two or three episodes of encounters, because he said it would be too much for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200634\">them. Like, either they were really good girls who suddenly started talking dirty and confessing their fantasies and doing all these dirty things, and then felt so much shame that they never wanted to talk to him again, or, it was too much for them. And having been with him, I\u2019d get that. Like, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200635\">totally possible. But I don\u2019t know why on this one I feel like my reaction should be wow, what a bastard. He practically raped this girl or something and I shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. But that\u2019s not my reaction at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: What have you noticed? What has it been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">CLIENT: I forgive him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">TEHRAPIST: When you say forgive him, what do you forgive him for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: For cheating. And if it was anything really serious, this girl would have pressed charges. She would have made a big deal about it.  But that didn\u2019t happen. I also tried to inquire \u2013 I was acting all na\u00efve, \u2018cause I\u2019m acting like this young girl on Facebook. And I said, oh, I don\u2019t know whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">I should trust him. He\u2019s always really vague about his life and he\u2019s always busy. Do you think he\u2019s married or do you think he\u2019s dating someone else? And she\u2019s like, I have no idea that he\u2019s married or if he\u2019s dating someone else, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt it. So that was another confirmation of oh, he doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B2\">tell everyone he sleeps with that he\u2019s married and about his life. That\u2019s all she knew about him. He was an emergency room nurse from Connectict. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What did that mean to you that he didn\u2019t tell her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: That I\u2019m different. Because I think that that\u2019s always on my mind. And like, have there been others like me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Is that right? You mean, that it had gone on before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: That far. And he claims, he just told me \u2013 I think I told you this recently, that in April, I think it was a year and a half and he was like, besides my marriage, this is the longest relationship I\u2019ve had. And I know he\u2019s slept with a lot of women and I know that he cheated on his wife a lot. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">And I really want to know that I\u2019m different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: No, I see it. I see it. That does seem like an important aspect to it. Some of the appeal of it is that in addition to the kind of experiences themselves you go into with him, and the opportunity \u2013 the continued opportunity to do it, it\u2019s something about him sticking with you. Is it that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">he that you\u2019re one of the few people that he would do that with or you\u2019re the only one he would do that with? You know, what is the (inaudible at 00:23:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Like kind of telling me a side of himself that he doesn\u2019t share with other people. And after finding this out, I didn\u2019t confront him with it, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t think it would be a productive conversation and I feel like I had already decided how I\u2019m going to feel about it. And I tried to inquire <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">about other relationships. I said something like none of the people you\u2019ve just randomly slept with, you\u2019re not Facebook friends with them, right? You don\u2019t still have their phone numbers, right? I\u2019m different that way. And what did he say? He said, you don\u2019t realize how much of myself I share with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200772\">you that I don\u2019t share with other people. I mean, I hope that\u2019s true. I\u2019m still bothered, though. How am I not upset that he cheated on me a year ago? I think I keep holding onto the hope that now everything\u2019s all out in the open. We\u2019re being really honest with each other and things will be different now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">THERAPIST: You know, I think maybe there\u2019s an element of it that is kind of like, well, as you say compartmentalized or something, maybe. But I also hear that there\u2019s something that was preserved was your sense of being special.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Like, it didn\u2019t threaten that part of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">THERAPIST: And I think you would have felt different if it would have been that he had been carrying on things like this a while and he had several people. There\u2019s something to you about the fact that he feels very \u2013 that you\u2019re in this kind of other category that\u2019s really important to you about it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">all from what I\u2019m gathering. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so unhealthy, though. This is \u2013 we\u2019re talking about a married man here. Let\u2019s not forget that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s forgetting that?

What made you say it\u2019s unhealthy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s all true and that makes sense, but I feel like none of it is valid or important, because it\u2019s not even a real relationship. I\u2019m frickin\u2019 having an affair with a married man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s not real about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: That if I\u2019m special or if I\u2019m not special, that it\u2019s important to me. I feel like the rational side of me is coming out and pointing a finger and saying, wake up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well you know, I actually think that \u2013 I mean, I can see the point in terms of hey, yeah, are you neglecting a side of the \u201creality\u201d of it? But, you know, in another way you\u2019re trying to really \u2013 I mean, just when I was talking for instance, about the specialness of it is a reality. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">it\u2019s a reality. You feel that.  it\u2019s as real as anything else.

I don\u2019t sense that you do. I don\u2019t sense that \u2013 I instead think that there\u2019s some meaning of all this to you that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s a complex one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just so frustrating, too. When was it, last Monday when I wasn\u2019t expecting to cry in here and I cried, and then I went to dinner with my friends. They told me oh, you look so serious. And it was because I was still thinking, Melanie, why are you drawn to the dysfunction? You know, same <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">thing I\u2019m thinking right now in this moment. Is that the best you can do? Why do you have to fall in love with a married man? Why can\u2019t you just be normal?  (pause) I feel like I had normal and I screwed it up. But I didn\u2019t even really want it. I was kind of like, eh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: Well, you know, among other things there\u2019s something about it didn\u2019t quite capture, I don\u2019t think \u2013 Come to think of it I don\u2019t think you felt like that kind of special kind of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: No, I was even questioning it James. Remember how I told you I once looked through his dissertation.  It said to very best friend and love, his ex-girlfriend. And then I was like, is every girlfriend your best friend? Like, he\u2019s just this guy that always wants to be in love and wants to be married <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">so much. It\u2019s almost like it could be interchangeable, like whoever he ends up with. And so I didn\u2019t like that part. I felt like I\u2019m just the next one that he falls in love with. (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">Brian has been talking to me a lot about his family lately. I remember one day, and this was more than a month ago already. I remember I jokingly said to him, I haven\u2019t heard from you in a long time. What are you doing, visiting Kensington? Because he used to joke that he had a lot girls in Kensington. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200991\">And I get back a picture of him on the couch with like, his son on his lap, watching cartoons. And in the distant background a chair, like a loveseat over there, I see her foot. Like, she\u2019s sitting in the chair over there and here he is with his son on his lap, watching cartoons. Like, I got an inside <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200992\">view of what his life is like. It\u2019s just so strange to me that he has me and he has this life, and then on Saturday morning, this Saturday, he called me and I was like, what are you doing. Oh, I\u2019m on my way to Logan\u2019s swimming lesson. They\u2019re in the car behind me following me. So like, the son and wife <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200993\">are in the car behind him, he\u2019s on his way to a swimming lesson. I\u2019ll call you afterwards and tell you about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">I don\u2019t even know why they\u2019re still together. I think I have a big fear that he\u2019s not telling me what\u2019s really going on, and maybe it is more like a marriage than what he says. So (inaudible at 00:30:44) you think about it like, he hasn\u2019t really lied. Like, everything he told me \u2013 like he said I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B1\">it was over a year ago with this girl, and it was and it was once, and it was. And you\u2019re different and I don\u2019t tell other people about my life and you\u2019re the longest one I\u2019ve had. We were \u2013 he came over \u2013 I don\u2019t remember, just the other day and we ordered food and we sat at my little kitchen table <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B2\">across from each other and like, my kitchen\u2019s tiny, and the table\u2019s tiny, so it\u2019s like, very intimate. And he started talking about \u2013 I don\u2019t know how we got on the topic, of his dad abusing him and how he feels like he\u2019s dealt with that over the years. And how it\u2019s very hurtful that, you know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B3\">innocence that he saw in himself he sees in his son now, and how that can be just ripped away. And how he kind of mourns who he could have been if that hadn\u2019t happened. Like, it was a really intimate, deep conversation. And then later on that night when we were saying goodnight he said something like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B4\">you know, we do all these things like, in bed and we have this amazing sex life, and we really open to each other. But sitting at the kitchen table with you to day like, talking about that stuff, that seems a lot more intimate. You know, so that stuff makes me feel special.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What did you notice about what you felt when he told you that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">CLIENT: Like validated. Like, that\u2019s what I feel. I feel like that\u2019s really intimate and special. And like, wow, he agrees and he recognizes that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And you too, felt special, him sharing that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: Still, reality is hard.

And then that\u2019s when I thought, oh, on one of those Saturday nights when he tells me <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB1\">he\u2019s working, he\u2019s probably at a wedding. And then I think of him all dressed up and I think of her all dressed up. And I\u2019m like, they went on a date together as a couple to a wedding. I mean that hurts, but of course, I mean, that\u2019s his wife. (pause) And he told me all about Easter. Like, going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB2\">his uncles and the family members and all the drama going on. And sometimes I try to picture what will that look like? They took two cars so that she could stay longer with the son, with the family. So I\u2019m getting the impression oh, she must be close to them. She must get along with them. Like, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB3\">is going to be the reaction when suddenly he\u2019s like, surprised, I\u2019m divorced and he\u2019s my mistress? That\u2019s why sometimes I feel that\u2019s never going to happen. He\u2019s not the type of person to rock the boat that much, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I keep thinking it\u2019s kind of like the question for you is, all right, I feel special, but just how special?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">THERAPIST: How far does that go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. And I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to ask, or that would be a lot to ask, especially since I messed up a month ago. Like, I feel I just have to keep working to earn it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: What are you working on? What does it feel you\u2019re working on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: Like, so he\u2019ll leave her and he\u2019ll start a life with me. Either move in with me or introduce me to his son. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: What would do it?

We were having a conversation last night on the phone through texts. Like, I was telling him what a good weekend I had and how calm I feel, and I\u2019m in bed reading and I\u2019m going to volunteer for this thing at work tomorrow and he\u2019s like, I like this new, healthy Melanie. And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB1\">I do, too. But then again, it\u2019s that fear like I told you about last week of when am I going to mess up again.  Like just under control. That\u2019s what that means. Like, I won\u2019t suddenly \u2013 he jokes with me and actually would be offended that I\u2019m not. Because it\u2019s like a cartoon character of me. He makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB2\">me sound like I\u2019m this like, loud Latin woman. He jokes and says you\u2019re going to start banging your pots and pans, \u2018cause that\u2019s what people in Jamaica do. And you\u2019re going to start getting angry about whatever. So once in a while I would get upset about like, what am I to you? Where is this heading? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB3\">When am I going to meet your son? That\u2019s under the category of not healthy. That I need to just remain calm and patient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD\">THERAPIST: As opposed to the Jamaica \u2013 the fiery Latina woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. The fiery Latin girlfriend. That\u2019s what he\u2019d try. Yeah. And I need to not get drunk and out-of-control. And I need to not be interested in other men and stay loyal. And just like, healthy stuff. Like, even though I can\u2019t see him on weekends like, meet with friends on weekends and exercise <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF1\">and go to sleep at a decent hour. Like an adult. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">THERAPIST: That gets you the good stuff. The special.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E3\">CLIENT: Like behave. That behave. But in a way like, it doesn\u2019t feel like I want that. Like, it actually feels containing in a way for me. Like, I want that and I want to make him proud and earn him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E7\">CLIENT: But I feel like I should be kicking and screaming like, who are you to tell me, you know, how to act. I can be however I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And it seems like sometimes you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">CLIENT: (pause) I even get a little anxious anticipating, oh my God, when am I going to have had enough again and kind of blow up on him and be like, you know, what\u2019s going to happen with us, or what\u2019s the deal here? So far it\u2019s very at bay.  It\u2019s not brewing. Like, I keep hoping he\u2019ll end his program <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB1\">and then I can ask again and we can make a decision. \u2018Cause by October\/November it\u2019ll be two years and I can\u2019t be with him for longer than that if this isn\u2019t going in some direction. I\u2019m not getting any younger. I want to have a life. I want to have a family. So I feel like, calm down, you know? Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB2\">I have an image of him with a dog on a leash just petting. Calm. Stay calm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And don\u2019t bite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t bite. Wait for your treat. (pause) But like I said, that doesn\u2019t feel like \u2013 this doesn\u2019t make me angry or sad or mad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">THERAPIST: No. It feels like a version of love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">CLIENT: (pause) Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean the way you describe it. That\u2019s a fair \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s kind of that (inaudible at 000:41:52) They way that the owners kind of take care of you for rewards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">CLIENT: And the image is not like of a \u2013 Like normally you call someone a dog and it\u2019s not a very good compliment, you know, but the image I have in my head is more like a pristine looking dog.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Like what? What kind of dog?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I just picture like, Lady and the Tramp or something. Like, one of these cartoonish dogs with long, white straight hair that the fancy people would have. I used to have a dog in Chile, my first dog. My parents named him Anubis or something like that. He was an Afghan Hound. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200FB1\">I\u2019ve heard that they don\u2019t do well with children. And my mom was always scared that he would bite me. So I wasn\u2019t too close to him. But I remember him kind of being a serious kind of elegant dog. You know, kind of like arrogant in a way. And he had long, straight hair like that. And the gardener poisoned <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200FB2\">him and he died. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FF\">CLIENT: But for some reason \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t even like those kinds of dogs.

What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20103\">CLIENT: Anubis. I was like three.

But maybe I\u2019m into that. \u2018Cause a dog is submissive, you know. Loyal. Maybe I\u2019m \u2013 that\u2019s why it feels like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201071\">such a fit. Like I\u2019m so drawn to Brian, \u2018cause it just \u2013 and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s dominating over me in a way that\u2019s unhealthy or cruel or unfair. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20109\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot of different owner\/dog relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010B\">CLIENT: Right.

No, it\u2019s a very \u2013 It\u2019s a really important image that you say. It\u2019s a lot of meaning. This dog that has this \u2013 how did you describe it?

With its nose up in the air.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20111\">THERAPIST: Nose up in the air.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20113\">CLIENT: Like sitting just very straight and tall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20115\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really something.

Nose up in the air. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20117\">CLIENT: But inside it\u2019s just so broken. And I wonder with me is it broken inside, too.

I mean, you know how in here I keep saying I\u2019m scared. When am I going to mess up again. I think that\u2019s why it feels containing to me. But like that\u2019s so sad. Like, I thought I was stronger than that. Or maybe one day I will be. But at this point in my life, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2011B1\">like I need a leash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011D\">THERAPIST: What doesn\u2019t feel about it?

I hear it slightly differently, and I don\u2019t know if this is right or not, but I think \u2013 I hear it as you\u2019re putting yourself \u2013 like, that\u2019s the self-control.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20120-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20120-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563483\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20123\">CLIENT: Right. \u2018Cause I\u2019m willingly on the leash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

It\u2019s like he was trying to put the leash on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20131\">THERAPIST: Is that right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20133\">CLIENT: Like change this about yourself.
