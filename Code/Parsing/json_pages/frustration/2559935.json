I was curious if you could...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Do I remember what we talked about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yes, anything. I remember what we were talking about two times ago. We were talking about me going to my place, the old house, then there was a conversation about \"Mud\" and I think we talked about \"Mud\" a little bit at the beginning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Of last time (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I remember. I shared my impression of it as a fast-action thriller, which didn't vibe (ph) with yours. That's all I remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: What do you make of that? What happens to-not that it's unusual or anything, but what do you...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I don't know. It doesn't happen very often. I don't have a reflection (ph) on it really, yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">It makes me feel as if it speaks to the value of that time or something. Maybe it wasn't noteworthy. Maybe it wasn't progressive (ph). Maybe it wasn't... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That's where it leaves you wondering (ph) ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes, kind of a little bit. Maybe my performance wasn't-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh you're a performer (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes, even to myself even [inaudible at 00:02:50]. It's beside the point because there's something else that I'd rather talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I had a conversation with Laney the other night. I don't know when it was. I think it was actuallywe had this conversation before the last time I was here but it just kind of stuck out to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I was just about ready (ph) to get off the phone with my mom. I hadn't talked to my mom for a really long time, or my dad for a really long time. And then I talked to both of them within one or two days, within 24 hours of each other. It was interesting. I had a pretty run-of-the-mill conversation with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">my mom and she kind of finished with the same telling me to call my grandparents; telling me to think about them; telling me to be worried about them and that I need to love them. It ended in that conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And I remember I was talking to Laney about it and I was like, \"Oh, man, I didn't talk to my mom for about a week. I thought maybe she would have thought that I wasn't talking to her based upon that.\" I guess I was just like, \"Oh, wow. My mom clearly has no idea that this bothers me.\" Literally has <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">absolutely... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don't' know. I'm already (out there) (ph) second-guessing. Maybe she knows it bothers me, because I've told her before and I've tried to be delicate with it, but even without (going into the reasons) (ph) I've said to my mom that it really bothers me when we start having conversations like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">this. I've said that to her that clearly going into why. I don't even know if I can articulate it that clearly, let alone say it to her. But I've told her that it bothers me. I've told her that it pisses me off. And there's sometimes even then when she's saying it, she'll even sort of finish with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">\"Is this making you...Is this bothering you, again?\" She'll do that. \"Is it bothering you? Do you feel like I'm nagging you when I ask you to do this stuff?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559935\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Sometimes I wonder, maybe she's totally aware that it pisses me off. Maybe she just thinks it's just for...or maybe she just attributes my frustrations to irresponsibility or immaturity. Do you know what I mean? Like, \"Oh, maybe it pisses him off, but maybe not for reasons that...\", you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Like cleaning your room?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes, I was literally just thinking something like that; like taking a bath when you were kid. No kid wants to take a bath, but it's ultimately in that kids interest to take one, so you push through their own wants. I don't really know where to fall thinking about that. No, she definitely knows <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">it bothers me. It's not important to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Do you think she gets why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Probably. I get why, entirely, which I think maybe is one of the reasons why I get really frustrated with it because I have a really hard time saying it. I know that it's so easy. Absent some really clear reason, you're just being a bad kid who doesn't keep in touch with your family. That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">always there. That's where it's going to go unless there's a more persuasive explanation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Unless there's a really good \"why\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">This conversation I was having with Laney was right afterwards, and I was really bothered by it like I always am. And I just started talking to Laney and I started saying some of the things that I've spoken with you about. I was listing reasons like how does this seem so far-fetched to my mom, how is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">it impossible for my mom to wrap her head around the fact that this could genuinely bother me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I'd say things like I'm not even allowed, effectively, to talk to some of my grandparents-the one that's alive on my dad's side. I'll never see her again. I'll never talk to her again. I've never protested about that. So, I think it could be bothersome to then be sort of lectured in a very maternalistic <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">way about how to be a good grandson, while at the same time the implicit assumption is \"do the exact opposite with your other grandparent. It's really important that you keep in touch with your grandparents. They love you. They're getting old.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">Like every single thing. They might be good reasons in a certain situation, but I think you can be reasonable to sit back and say does this not seem inconsistent or something? I had that, so I was just kind of saying that to Laney. It was a unique conversation because I felt really confident about some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">of this stuff for the first time. And Laney was hardly listening, she was on the computer just hacking (ph) away, but it really stuck out to me, because the first time I was saying it I felt like I could actually stand behind it, which was weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: That's different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes, absolutely. I question sometimes if I'm just being irresponsible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it fills a substantive \"why\", a substantive reason to have these feelings, as opposed to just being impulsive or... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes, or lazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Lazy or whatever. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: And my (being a good family member) (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Reactionary (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I was having this conversation and these things felt more substantive. It made more sense to me. I felt more confident with it. And I was saying to Laney, too-I don't know if I spoke to you about this-that I remember when my dad moved out a really common thing that he used to do, but he doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">do this anymore, was have conversations with me. This was right after he moved out, months after he moved out. And he'd have conversations with me about how much he hated going up to New Hampshire (sp) and how happy he was that he didn't have to do it anymore. Almost in those terms. Sometimes he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">a little more subtle, but almost that explicitly. And then there's me, I was about 16, and I remember being uncomfortable with the conversations. I never really challenged them or anything; I just kind of listened to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559935\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">That was really annoying. My dad used to do that about my mom sometimes, too. He would lament about my mother to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Do you remember anything about that? I'm just trying to get a flavor of it, even if it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: She would do this, she would do that. She had these quirks that just... This type of stuff. A lot of it was...I think outside of that context, could have been just pretty benign stuff. But within that context it was not...I think I just agreed with him sometimes, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">Because in a way, there's things that piss me off about my mom, too. I talk about that here, but it's very different the moment I'm talking about them with Dad who just moved out. Do you know what I mean? I have to kind of go back. It was a pretty common thing. I can remember those conversations really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">well. And it was weird. Sometimes I felt like some of the only times that I bonded with my dad were during those times, having conversations with him about all the things that pissed him off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Is that still you felt he was open to bonding around that or you felt bonded to him, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: When I said we were bonded, I just mean to say that I feel like it wasn't...I guess those were some of the closest times we had; that's not to say we were very close at all. Those were easier conversations we would have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: He used to do that about New Hampshire (ph) a lot, a lot. He still does a little bit about New Hampshire (ph). He'll talk about how he just couldn't stand going up there and the personality differences that he had with everyone up there. He didn't like their lifestyle. They were lazy and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">sat around and ate all the time. He didn't like my mom's brother-in-law at all. And he really hated it up there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">He used to go up there a lot more with my mom and me, when I was a lot younger, but then as I got a little bit older he kind of stopped going. It would be very sporadic, maybe on a holiday if everyone would be together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">Yeah, I don't know. That comes to mind. All of that feels wrapped up with that. I don't know. That feels like a thing, I guess. I don't know what the conclusion of that is, but that really pisses me off. I guess what I mean to say is I think that it was probably hard for me to process and make sense of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yes. What does it mean to you that you have those feelings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I don't just (ph) agree with him, just purely (inaudible at 00:16:25). I mean a lot of those things pissed me off about being up there, too. Quite frankly some of the things my dad would tell me about my mom, they bothered me a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It's not the content of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559935\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: No, it's not the content of it at all. I don't know. I guess it's just one more example of completely different things that were contradictory. I mean, what I was getting from my mom, what I was getting from my dad. My mom said let's go up there and see family, let's love them and let's treat <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">them like they're our family. And I'd go hang out with my dad and have these casual conversations about how much it sucks up there. At the time I don't think I saw that. I think they didn't seem to conflict as clearly as it seems to now, but I feel that the tension was there at times but I don't think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">I attributed it at all to that.  That doesn't seem really fair, to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: That...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: That that was my experience. That that was what happened, I guess. At this time my dad was still-I seemed to think that both of my parents were still this authority that was still in unison. It just didn't seem like something to look out for. They seemed... Well, they were still so together <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">with the way that things happened. I mean, they weren't violently opposed. That wasn't the mind frame I went into it with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mind frame you went into...? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Like, oh these are two adversarial people that I need to be a buffer between. Even as it was occurring in more subtle ways sometimes. It just didn't occur to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: I'm thinking about this being (about two things) (ph) about the conversations with your mom about your relatives that you'd be in contact with. Two things that strike me about it is one is that it's almost like your reaction to her doing and saying these things should be more (inaudible). <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">It's similar to your dad's. It was almost like you were like something that was arising was something that your dad might have felt, too. Something like, \"Wait a second.\" I mean not that you have the same feelings towards those relatives, but something about, \"I don't want to go up to New Hampshire. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200792\">I don't know about all that. I don't want to be in contact.\" It's like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: That's not all (inaudible) that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: But that's important, some element, and you're sort of saying there was all this stuff between the two of them. No animosity, in unison, and underneath it rancor around relatives. And what does your mom see in his family and what does your dad see in her family and you start to get into <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">some real feeling. Some elements say wait, there's a lot here that was going awry. Sub contentious, maybe not so much, I don't hear you say that about what your mom felt about your dad's side. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: She didn't know them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: She didn't know them!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: She couldn't feel anything about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">It's the same thing. The ultimate fact at the end of the day is they're not...I can't say things and throw things out there and say my parents did this, because there's not that. I can't justifiably not go up to New Hampshire (ph) on the pretense that my father won't let me see his family. Because my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">mom didn't do that and that's my mom. It's not my dad. It's not my parents. At least with respect to what I can do now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: But if family's so important then why am I not seeing this one side of the family? Why am I just seeing this side? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Well on some purely logical level.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559935\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: But having some visceral...some feeling about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: I think the resemblance was the fact that I'll never see them. That's cool. I felt like that was something I could have been mad about. I feel like that would have been a very justifiable thing for me to get angry about and say, \"I want to go see my family.\" In that situation that sounds like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">a transgression (ph) interestingly, whereas on the other side of my family with my mom that's what's being shoved down my throat. I didn't do that. I let those terms just be set for me and never whispered about it even. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">I mean at this point now it feels really disrespectful to be spoken to by my mother, who wants to try to lecture me about how to be a good family member, while at the same time I feel that she is completely unaware and no interest (ph) in examining the ways in which I have done these things for my family. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">She's assuming this position of moral authority that seems disrespectful. I've said to you before I don't get (ph) to see my family. That was my dad's thing. It's his conflict. That's cool. I can take that. I won't miss them (ph). It doesn't (ph) keep me up at night. I'll take that and that's fine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F2\">But I guess what I just thought would have been assumed was... As my parents, they have sort of sacrificed their ability to dictate to me how to treat the rest of your family. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Why is this okay over here, but not over here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes, so it's like let's forget about this, this isn't a thing. And this is just like you're going to act like (Barry and Melanie) (ph) who grew up two feet away from their grandparents, went there every day after school. That drives me crazy! I don't want to be a part of it. I feel like, in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">going up there, I'm swallowing my pride almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: I see. I get it. Almost like you're supposed to just do what's been taught to you to do or to think and to feel about this stuff and to do it in a way that you feel is unquestioningly (sp?) so. Don't talk to these; talk to these.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Love these people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Love these.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Don't be emotionally attached to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And don't be emotionally attached to them, yes. I see what you're saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">I was thinking, too, that there's something that kind of brings me back to when-I don't really recall if it was you were in the car while your father was having this fight with his family that last time, and maybe the car's wrong, but somehow...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: I was in the car looking out the back window. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: In some way...what it meant to you to just drive off and not see these folks again. And again, not just because of whatever possible potential of emotional connection it was for you (ph), but the importance that I was thinking about was that it was telling you, demanding it, that you just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">leave your own feelings about all that aside in some way. Not addressing the meaning of all that to you. Not addressing the impact of what just happened on you, but instead asking you to be cool with it. Asking you to be cool with it. In some way to shelve (ph) a lot of whatever was potential for you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">to feel. Maybe you didn't even know. Now what do you (inaudible)? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: It's definitely not a reaction to not being able to see people that I miss. That's definitely not any aspect of it at all. But that is a dynamic. I guess the fact that anything (ph) was asked of me, that I did anything, which in my mind I felt like I did. That was a big thing to do. Then after <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">that, to take this position, and after all these other examples, too, where I feel like I really, really tried to tailor the way that I dealt with my family.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559935\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">Like my mom and dad concerned with no one's interests but there's. Genuinely really trying to think about them. Really trying not to make it more difficult for them at possibly a significant cost to me. And then to just take this posture, speaking to me about my grandparents, as if I had no clue what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">it means to think about your family. That just seems like the only place where those types of comments could come from. And just to hear that, it's just like, \"Fuck you!\" Is that really where we're at right now? Do you think that little of me, of like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: But if you (inaudible phrase at 00:29:52)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yes, I guess it just seems to suggest the Like it doesn't (inaudible), right? You're speaking to me as if I have no clue how to care about my family which seems to suggest that I haven't worked really hard at times to try to make things go more smoothly. Which I feel like I did. I really do. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">I really felt like I did. And to speak to me as if she needs to instruct me to be caring when I feel like, geez, my concern and care for my mom is like... I couldn't get out of it for so long. Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">I guess just after all that, after growing up, that there wouldn't just be, \"This is your decision, to figure out how you want to relate to your family. Just one little scrap of semblance in your family tree that looks like a normal family. We'll let you make your own informed decision about how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">feel.\" And I'd probably go up and see them, quite frankly. Because I know that my grandparents up in New Hampshire (ph) had nothing to do with any of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I see what you're saying. There's something about you getting that demand, or the instruction to do something that you already know good and well and that you've already been doing. I was wondering if it feels like it's almost like by saying that, it's not acknowledging what you've already <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">been doing all this time. It's almost like, \"What? Does she not get what I've been doing all this time?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Precisely. I'm just sick of being spoken to like I'm not capable of taking into consideration the feelings of my family members and I'm also just sick and tired of having people just pointing (ph) directions and telling me how to feel about it and what to do. I don't know. I'm sick of it. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">feel like I've done that. It pisses me off. Sometimes it just feels completely ignored. It just makes my family...I think this gets to some of those comments that I've said to you some time ago, that when I'm with my family there's this very fantalizing (ph) feeling of this dynamic where it's right <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B12\">back to everything's dictated. Like it makes me feel like my family is always going to be on those terms. Like there's no...If I don't see my grandparents, I have these conversations with my mom and I want to break my phone. And if I go up there, I feel like I'm giving in to those terms or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B13\">Either way it just leaves me feeling like shit. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559935\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">(15 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: (Where were you just now?) (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: I was just thinking to myself, you know we started the conversation. I would not have that conversation with my mom. That would be a hard thing for me to talk about, obviously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What comes to mind (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: Her feelings.

That's the opposite of what I want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: That's the conflict, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Sometimes when I might think about this, because I've thought about this in more abstract terms sometimes, sometimes I think that I'm going to have to live with this. I'm going to have to do something. I'm going to have to see my grandparents or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">I think about making peace sometimes, and the only thing that I can actually, really think about, that gives me a modicum (sp?) of comfort, is thinking to myself, well, if my mom can get to that position and see to (ph) me in a way that, from my experience, is so evidently so far removed from the amount <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">of effort that I've put in at times the care that I've taken into consideration if she's that far out, then on some weird level I accomplished something growing up if that's what I was trying to accomplish, which I think I was on some level. Because that means my mom's not staying up at night thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D12\">that she ruined my life or something. At least my mom's talking to me the way that-My mom's not tip-toeing (sp?) around her divorce guilt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I see what you're saying. And then to say something about what it's felt like to you, or say just what you've fantasized about saying, would give her the potential to undo that or give a reason to stay up at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: I think it would be extremely upsetting to her, to have that conversation.

There's the acknowledgement <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">of a feeling there that's not cool, that's not \"everything's okay\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: It would absolutely require me (inaudible) sharing with her and putting that on her.

What is she feeling? What's going on <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E31\">for her? And why? What is she...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">CLIENT: She's alone. She's literally in a house alone, probably sick, arthritis in her hands. Trying to already deal with this medication that she's taking with terrifying side effects, working 10 hour days like she does sometimes, and then at the end of the day having to tie it all up with the fact <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">that she was...I think that's what I was saying. This is what she would think on her standards, she would think she was a horrible mom. On her standards. I know that regardless of how I put that, by her standards, that's what it would feel like to her. And that seems like a pretty reasonable thing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E52\">go to lengths to want to stave off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Avoid, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">CLIENT: That's what it seems like in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">(16 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: (inaudible whispered phrase) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: And I'd agree. I would not be anecdotal when I say that's a comforted thought to think that maybe my mom could be that removed from some of those things (inaudible phrase at 00:43:49). I'm not being funny or ironic (ph) or something. I genuinely wouldn't want my mom to really harp (ph) on that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">kind of stuff.
