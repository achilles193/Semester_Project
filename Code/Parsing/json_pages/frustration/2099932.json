I've mostly been [inaudible at 00:01:51], how many, how long in the day I want to keep working. I'm analyzing a lot of new data and I'm getting [inaudible at 00:02:04] tomorrow, so I have work to do and I'm enjoying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">it. And my meditation is a restart and it's a nice way to avoid things building up. Where is that coming from? Here in my book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Are they Peruvian?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: They're from [inaudible 00:04:21] colony.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: They look large. Some of my feelings are getting channeled into hypersexuality. I feel very sexual and I want to be sexed. And I had a really nice talk about sexual promiscuity and how that is something that I that really appeals to me right now. And we talked about all the different ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">in which that would happen, not for real but maybe for real, I don't know. Not for real. And we talked about a couple that we would be willing to swing with. That was fun. While he cared a lot about how the woman looked, I cared a lot about whether I had a connection with the guy or the girl. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And I feel like I want to be sexual with so many people and it's not I think it's very much playing out of what's happening to me. And then I had a wet dream, which for women [inaudible at 00:07:27] work out for me but it involved becoming very aroused and [then I got] (ph) very wet. And the dream <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">was about all of my dreams involve some big family gathering with conference and two members of my life, Betty (ph) and Kurt, basically decided to at separate times come on to me. And in the dream what was vivid was slow soft kisses from Betty (ph) and Kurt was less slow and soft. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It was pretty hot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It was hot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: [Pause] I was thinking that you kind of wonder or worry about what I'd be comfortable with or okay with as far as how specific or explicit you are talking about sex or [inaudible at 00:11:14] about me or otherwise -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: That's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: that you worry [inaudible at 00:11:38] too much or going too far or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I worry sometimes about everything under the sun, if I would get an idea where I go too far.

I don't know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Initially you sound like a very high reaction that's so high that you feel a little flushed. That's more the issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: But maybe it has to do with how I want you to see me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I think apparently as a modest thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I see. I think I am those things but I don't know, I think too much about other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Thinking about other things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes.

Both of those things and during the bike [inaudible at 00:22:46] ride your bike and also what parties look like for you, comes up a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yes, that's a good event to demonstrate that. I wonder what your children look like. You're answering no.

Yes, the banana phase or session is different. As we were coming on the close of the banana thing, I think I would like to talk about sex more but I don't have anything obvious to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well what comes to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: I need a question.

And I think the banana made you forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: It did. Jeremy has a couple of friends who are, who've been with a lot of women and well one of them is Davis, the second drummer. And he tried to have sex with me and he tried to put his penis into me and I said no. And Davis later told Jeremy that he while I was really great that I was too <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">innocent for him and that it wasn't going to work out. This was at some point after he, or maybe before he cheated on me and why I'm still a virgin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">There's another friend, Brett, who's very sweet and very beautiful but also had beds with many women and so we were talking about whether Brett and his girlfriend Gina (ph) would be an acceptable couple. And I thought that Brett wouldn't have me or he wouldn't want to have me because I'm too he's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">too experienced or something and I'm not experienced enough. And Jeremy thought that that was ridiculous and said that I would satisfy any man. And I don't know if that's true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">And I [inaudible at 00:30:27] what I said to Drew. And yes, he was fine. I mean I don't know what that means. I think I would satisfy any man because of the nature of men, not because of my nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: I guess I imagine that's not what he meant because he's saying nice things about you and seeing somebody in bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yes, so I think I have a I think I feel insecure about my sexual experience and how sweet and innocent and how promiscuous and dirty and dangerous it hasn't been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: And then I think you sometimes want it to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes, I really do want it to be that way, especially now. But it's very physical; it's not a I think maybe why I can't, why I don't have much to say or describe is because I just feel it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well when I wouldn't explain myself, why did you really rise at me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yes, I think the guy you want to meet your family you're uncomfortable about. It's the charge (ph) thing to do and I imagine you had a thought about [seeing it] (ph) provocatively. And then there's another part of you that sort of shut down around that. And then you couldn't think of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">anything to talk about to do with sex. And it's just that it's hard to talk about because it's a physical thing. I know it's a very physical thing. It's not that I don't understand that but I think that's not why it's hard to talk about or that words can't have sexual kind of content or convey sexuality. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F2\">I mean... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: I'm not good at trying to provoke you sexually. That would be awful. But at the same time I guess I hope that it is provocative to you to hear me talk about being aroused and wet after my dream. So maybe it feels like I am provoking you and I don't want to talk about it. And I don't want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">find out that it doesn't provoke you and I don't want to keep trying or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: [Pause] First you want me to be really attracted and turned on by some of the things you were talking about and not because you made an effort to seduce me but because that's my response to you. And I am my usual being difficult, I mean not just in a view (ph) to any of that but also in not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">structuring the discussion so much in a way that makes this easier like asking questions or stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes.
