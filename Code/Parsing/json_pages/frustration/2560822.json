I was wondering if you [laughs] could comment on that a little bit more whether that was a throwaway analogy or whether that meant something more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I don't recall...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Okay, all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: ...comparing your relationship to Nazi Germany.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: [laughs] Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: But that's what stuck with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I think I laughed in surprise at the time. I said something to the effect of, \"[United against] (ph) a common enemy,\" and you said, \"Yes, well, that worked for Nazi Germany, also,\" as if...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Yes, you didn't actually compare my relationship to Nazi Germany, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I felt like there's a possible interpretation of you saying that where you meant something more than I don't know what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Hmm. I mean, I'll definitely tell you what I specifically meant but I'm curious about the way you took it and\/or (ph) it's stayed with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Okay. I took it in as, \"There's an odd thing that I was not expecting.\" It felt like I was saying, \"Well, here's at least a positive thing that came out of this bad experience with Jannis,\" and you said, \"Yes, well, that is a positive thing, but...\" and I'm not quite sure what the \"but\" is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well, actually, I wasn't saying \"but,\" I was actually saying I don't necessarily think that's a positive thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: I see. Okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And maybe, as I'm seeing (ph) it now, that may have been premature. I can see why there would be-I'm not saying I was right...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: ...but if I think about what you were saying, \"Well, it connected us in a particular way.\" And I guess, you know, if I think about it very directly, I was saying that's maybe not the greatest basis for a connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: I certainly wasn't comparing your relationship to Nazi Germany, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't really think you were, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But it stayed with you, and it seemed yeah (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think because mostly because I was a little bit surprised to hear you say and clearly not quite understanding what you meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I'm still not quite clear on... I guess, in context, what would be a good basis for a connection?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Well, that's a very good question. That's (ph) a much broader question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: Because that does feel... Yeah, I guess I'm not fully understanding. So am I saying that does that seem like that would be a priTanya basis for a connection, a common enemy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: No, no, not really. It was just... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">I think the reason it stuck with me is just this. I was telling you about an experience that wasn't great, but I was saying, \"Well, here's this other thing. At least it did this.\" And you were like, \"Yeah, well, that's not so good.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">And that's surprising, that response, when I was saying it as this ameliorating factor, in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560822\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I was clearly saying that, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: So then, (inaudible at 00:08:35) I was saying that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">But if we take up your other question, well, what is a good basis for a connection? That's a pretty big question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: It is, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: I like big questions, but I don't think I'm really going to try to answer that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: We went to see Dr. Jannis (sp?) on Monday. I like him. Tanya (ph) likes him. I think we'll keep seeing him. A change in a positive direction from Dr. Jannis... So thank you for the recommendation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: I'm in this space where I'm not really sure where I am today, so I'll tell you about where I was last time I left you, and then we can end up back where we are today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">When I came here last time, I thought I was doing reasonably okay. There's sort of a (inaudible at 00:11:46) talked about how that these things that you'd said had been very helpful, and I have been working to apply them, use them, that had been good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: I think the most amusing way to story is that you said, \"Oh, that's good, so let's talk about this other thing. Let's talk about your sex life. How's that going?\" And that, in a sense, just completely tanked me. That's amusing in a sense of, \"That's working out for you? Are you sure?\" [laughs] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F1\">It's a way to (inaudible at 00:12:50), which is not at all what you were really doing I don't think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Wait, are you sure? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: I wasn't the questioning the same thing that you said (inaudible at 00:13:02).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: No, absolutely not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:13:05), so, (crosstalk at 00:13:06).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: It was more a question of the-I think, in some sense, what I was implying by saying, \"These are working well,\" is, \"I'm doing okay.\" And you're saying, \"Okay, that's good. I'm not really sure that's true.\" I don't think you did that, but that's it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well, it would assume that I knew that other things weren't working out for you, and I didn't know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Which is why I don't think it's a factually accurate description, so I'm not sure why I felt it (ph) that compelling, there. I don't really find it a true narrative, just this... Anyway, I think we get stuck on that for a while, but I don't know whether there's actually meaning in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F1\">it or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But it seems like I have a lot of negative things to say: \"Your relationship is like Nazi Germany,\" \"Are you really sure things are working out for you?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Sounds like I have a lot of those kinds of things to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, it sounds like, when I tell it that way. For me, I think, what really happened is I had been... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">I guess you talked in the end about Tanya's and my sex life in the context of unmet needs and failure to balance needs. And I think both there were a lot of specific feelings that I had not been dealing with, because there's (ph) too many feelings to deal with, all of the negative feelings all at once <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB1\">on that subject. And then that is related to all of the other issues in the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">CLIENT: I feel like I'm really struggling to communicate this effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B9\">CLIENT: To go back to your \"A lot of negative things\" comment, I think the world is more comforting if you're an all-seeing wizard which I know you're not, and I'm okay with you not being, it's just as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560822\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">But in some sense, you may as well be, because... It's a particular feature of our relationship, or how you work, or something that... In some sense, you find the problem areas, which is part that resolving problems, if she was [finding with her] (ph) (inaudible at 00:18:40).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">So given that I had a whole lot of negative feelings about my relationship, between Wednesday and Sunday-ish or further but...  I think it's comforting for there to be someone else who recognizes the relationship dynamics as unhealthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: Which I'm pretty sure you do, regardless of any specific thing that you did or didn't do or say or didn't say if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I'm not 100% committed to that, what you just said. I'm not going to 100% endorse it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It certainly what you just said clarifies my thought that you're taking, you saw what I was saying much more negatively than I had at least intended it.  That fits (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I presented it back to you today much more negatively than I actually took it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Maybe you're also saying on a basic level that it's helpful for me to validate your experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely; that has been helpful a number of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">THERAPIST: But this distinction that I'm going to try to make is important, and it goes to your sort of wizard, your thought of well, maybe I can be a wizard or maybe I am and knowing that that's sort of funny and comical because it's not true, but maybe there's some, \"it would be nice if the world <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D51\">worked that way.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">CLIENT: I think I'd actually be less happy in that world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">CLIENT: I don't know, but (inaudible at 00:21:39). I'm interested in what you had to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, in terms of your feeling negative about the relationship and it's nice to sort of feel that I would see it as unhealthy dynamic; somehow, that it would jive, somehow, your experience with my assessment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">I'm not even sure I would commit to that, your relationship being unhealthy, because I don't know what you need and what would be good enough for you and what you want. I mean, I know, but I can't know that for you. I can help you understand your experience and figure out what kind of relationship you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF1\">want and whether this is sufficient or not, essentially, to put it in a very crude way; but it's not my job, nor, I think, is it really within my ability to assess your relationship, \"This is good, this is bad,\" as some sort of objective measure because you're living in it, and it's your relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">CLIENT: I think there's a sense in what you're stressing, true things a little bit at the expense of other true things. I think you can tell when I am having a good experience or not, from talking with me, but that's a minor quibble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">What you said is actually very helpful, because I think it clarifies why I would not be that happy in a world where you were a wizard. Because if you were a wizard, you would have a very clear sense of what I should do, but you are claiming that you do not have a clear sense and in fact can't. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560822\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">While you might have opinions about it, that's different from you being a wizard and knowing what I actually should do.

I got about as far as...  Your description of the role that you play in some sense relates to me figuring <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201031\">out what I need, deciding whether it's sufficient or playing a role about facilitating that journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">CLIENT: I got as far as I'm not really sure what I need, then here we are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Well, with your not being happy with important aspects of your relationship is not only causing a problem of you being unhappy, but it's causing a problem of you don't know what to do about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's definitely true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: It seems like one of the things that you took away from last week which I actually think I would agree with this you were saying about last week's session, I would agree with this in general, that at times, you don't let yourself know how unhappy you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely right. Well, I think it's a little more general than unhappy. It depends on how you define unhappy, but in some sense, sad is an emotion that sometimes I don't let myself know how much I am, or angry is another that I felt (inaudible at 00:30:34). Uncovered in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201151\">session, in some sense; been there, but I haven't been acknowledging. Yeah, that sounds right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">It goes back to the wizard theory (ph). You help me find those places (inaudible at 00:30:54). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">THERAPIST: I like to think of myself as a really good navigational system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yes. You're definitely that. [laughs] I just like the word \"wizard,\" it's fun.

But no, you are-yeah, I guess that's not the best analogy, in the sense that to use a navigational system well, you have to know where you're going, and I think particularly in that type of feature, finding a place where I am not acknowledging some way that I feel. I don't know where I'm going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess it's not a good analogy because usually in the navigational system, you have to program in your destination. Your destination is \"better.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">CLIENT: [laughs] Well, now you're just a wizard. Take me to better.

That (crosstalk at 00:33:18).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: Sorry, but I particularly didn't want to answer it at that moment, I felt like some of the other things that we've just talked about were important context for you to have in what I was thinking about, but fair enough. That is an important question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: Different people have different answers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: Dr. Jannis, I think, seeks to answer that question for any given couple by asking them, without telling them he's asking them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">He started our session by asking how we met, how we came together, which was really interesting and I think a clever tool. Obviously, the tone of two people coming in to couples' counseling is not, \"Hey, everything's great!\" so it's an interesting way of turning that around so that the tone isn't necessarily <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B1\">negative the entire time, but also gives the context for, \"Yeah, this (ph) is nice.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">I'm sorry. I know you know this field very well and are quite good at it, just was interested in that particular technique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, why would apologize for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">CLIENT: [sighs] In case you took it as I was telling you how to do your job or something like that, which I... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">THERAPIST: Nope (ph). I didn't take it that way, for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">CLIENT: Okay. That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">Anyways, so I don't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">CLIENT: ...so that's an interesting approach, and I guess what he took from what we said was that we connected particularly on intellectual questions and sort of a... desire for knowledge and truth and (inaudible at 00:35:52) liking to talk about ideas. That seems like an okay basis for connection. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B1\"> It's certainly one I value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">CLIENT: What he sort of left on the table, because I think he had gotten enough answer for the moment, was that we were both somewhat discontent (inaudible at 00:36:27), at the time, so there was this sort of-yeah, I guess there's a way to project that it's the same, like uniting against a common enemy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F1\">but that was, in that case it was much more finding someone else who's having a similar experience of the world.
