And instead of seeing them every month he was going to see me in December. So when I first went up to get my prescriptions in October I called <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">a week ahead of time that they were due, gave them the message that I would be needing my narcotics prescriptions, okay? So the following week I called on a Monday because he\u2019s only there on Tuesdays you know. And I said I need to know if he\u2019s going to fill out the scripts and at one time I says because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">I have to book the ride. And I says I can\u2019t call up the day that I\u2019m going to them because they could say we\u2019ll pick you up at 1 o\u2019clock for your appointment but we won\u2019t be able to come back to pick you up until 5, you know? So nobody ever called me back. They were going to pass it along to the nurse <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">and she was supposed to let me know what time to come in. It didn\u2019t happen. It didn\u2019t happen. So I got a phone call at 2 o\u2019clock Tuesday afternoon to say my prescriptions were done. Well, I don\u2019t have a way to get up there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">Well, I called up one of my friends that lives in the building. Greta. We went to school together. So I says, \u2018Greta, could you do me a favor? Just run me up to the clinic and I\u2019ll be right out.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: And this is what day now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: This is the day before \u2013 two days before Thanksgiving. Okay? So I went up, we asked about my scripts, and you know I\u2019m downstairs. So that was October. That was for November. Now come December I saw him like the first of the month and I said to him, this 28 day shit just ain\u2019t working out for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">me. So he says, well I\u2019ll move you up to 26 days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: So what\u2019s the difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: To pick up the prescriptions. Don\u2019t ask me why he\u2019s moving me up to the 26th because, forget it. So December comes. I called a week ahead of time as usual to let them know. So nobody called me back. Well, it\u2019s the day before Christmas now. I just says to Greta \u2013 would you drive me up? I figured <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">they\u2019re going to be there because it\u2019s 28 days, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh, they do it every 28 days, not the 28th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Right. So I get up there. There\u2019s a skeleton crew and I said, do you have prescriptions for me? She says, no \u2013 no prescriptions. Dr. Winchester was on vacation that week. I says, well how am I supposed to get my meds? I says, I\u2019m all out of them. You know, what am I going to do for the pain, my pain medication?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. I says well don\u2019t you think maybe you could call them and see what\u2019s going on? So she called and explained it to him and he says he would talk to the doctor that was on call that day up at the clinic and have him write them out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But they did get in contact with Winchester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, but I had to wait for him to be done seeing patients. So it\u2019s been an hour now. Greta comes up to see how I am. She has to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So some nurse came out and Greta says, \u2018I thought something happened because she has never been there \u2013 the last time we came she was in and out in five.\u2019 Oh, well the doctor\u2019s doing this. I mean the nurse was trying \u2013 I says, \u2018well is was some shitty way of having communication.\u2019 Why didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">they call me a week ahead of time if they knew he wasn\u2019t going to be in?

Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Okay? So I\u2019m in the office crying to this nurse. I says, you know, I have no way home now. I don\u2019t have a fucking penny in my pocket. She says, \u2018I\u2019ll give you two taxi vouchers \u2013 one to take you to the drugstore to get your prescriptions and then another one for you to call them and have them <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">come pick you up when your prescriptions area ready and to take you home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going \u2013 no, I haven\u2019t even had this medicine and you know. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Well the doctor finally did write them out for me. But I mean I was there from 12 o\u2019clock until almost 2:30. No \u2013 that wasn\u2019t right at all. You know? I was embarrassed. I mean it was, you would have thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I was a criminal, you know, right? The doctor knows it but you\u2019ve got to wait. Yeah, well. I have it. So I wrote them \u2013 the patient advocate. I wrote her a three page letter and you know, I says, my whole holiday was ruined over that, I says, because I was so damned depressed and upset and embarrassed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">over it. So I says, forget it, you know? I says, I don\u2019t know whether I have to change doctors or what. If he just doesn\u2019t give a shit about his patients anymore. So my next visit wasn\u2019t until March. He moved it to three months now. So I said, no, no \u2013 I said to the girl at the desk. Make me an appointment <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B3\">for him with me for January I says because I\u2019m coming in. Once a month. So I came out to where I would have to go up there once a month to get my vitamin B12 shot. So that would be an $8 ride with the ride. And then I have to go up there another time to pick up my prescriptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: They can\u2019t do it on the \u2013 like every month?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Oh no. No, no, right? Because my vitamin B12 is due the first of the month and I wouldn\u2019t get my prescriptions until almost the end of the month. I said, uh huh [no], fuck this shit. So I said to the girl, \u2018make me an appointment.\u2019 And I wrote in the letter, from now on when I come in and see <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">him, I don\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s to say hello, good-bye \u2013 I\u2019m getting my prescriptions that day and I\u2019ll get my B12 shot that day. That\u2019s all there is to it. So, hopefully they got the letter today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yes. It\u2019s too infrequent to see your doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, with all the problems I have \u2013 yeah, right, you know? I\u2019ve got to go see the heart doctor for my \u2013 what do you call it? Pacemaker. Today I have you. Next week I have a mammogram and then I have an [appointment with], my psychiatrist. And then I have my foot doctor on Thursday. So I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday booked next week.

Right! Yeah, the other thing I was thinking about last time is \u2013 I wanted to ask you about today is how it\u2019s been meaningless frequently here. How have you found it to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Alright. You mean going every two weeks or sometimes every three weeks? Fine. I couldn\u2019t afford to come in every week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Has it been hard for you? I mean even though you \u2013 understanding that based upon what\u2019s going on for you \u2013 you have to come less frequently. How\u2019s it been for you? How\u2019s it been on you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Alright. You know? I mean, I don\u2019t know. You know. I\u2019ve had issues but then again we all have issues. But yeah. So yeah, next week it\u2019s the mammogram, the shrink, the foot doctor. The following week it\u2019s Dr. Elliott, and then you and then the surgeon. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: And what do you \u2013 you don\u2019t know when the surgeon is going to schedule you out but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: No. No idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Okay. Well, yeah, I\u2019m guessing that will be another break for us. Yeah, it\u2019s been \u2013 I was thinking you know, I guess why it came to mind was the last time we met, right at the end there we got into [Mark] (ph) and I was thinking, boy, Louise has a lot on her mind, a lot weighing on her and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">when we see each other less, it must be hard.

Yeah, it\u2019s for senior people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: So. Of course I get the letters from the 83 year old guys. I\u2019m not so sure I should go out with them. They\u2019ve got one foot in the grave. Don\u2019t forget to change your will honey. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: The will, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: So, I mean, I\u2019ve gotten some letters back from them and stuff but I\u2019m just not, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not that interested. Like yesterday I went on my computer and there was like 60 things \u2013 33 from the black men site and another 30 from the other. I just erased them all. I don\u2019t even know why I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">bothered to join because I just erase them all anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Not interested. Is it the age or just feel like you\u2019re not interested in dating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Not interested in dating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: And I write down that you know, I want them within a certain limit of where I live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: So I say, (unclear), why do you even fucking bother? [0:16:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Duh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: So yeah. I just get on there and \u2013 or if the black men (unclear) they don\u2019t look like that even \u2013 forget it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: You end up looking for guys like Mark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you know you really opened up to him in a very, very intimate \u2013 close to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: In a way, Louise, in all the ways that we\u2019ve been working together, he has been the one guy that kind of reignited something in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Big time. And it\u2019s not easy to \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not easy to get over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: To get over. Yeah. Yeah. He\u2019s still right with you<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. He\u2019s still in my thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what I would ever do if I saw him in person. But then again he would ignore me anyways. So it wouldn\u2019t make a difference? You know? [0:17:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You chose one tough character to get close to. And you got as close as I think anybody\u2019s going to get, Louise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know. What a fool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: What a fool? I think you kind of knew his game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: You knew his game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: There was something about him for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, there was. There was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: There is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t heard a word from him since September 1st.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Oh God. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Do you ever hear anything about what\u2019s going on with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: No. No. Not at all. And I don\u2019t think I want to know. You know? So. Because he\u2019s probably got some new sucker of a broad that he\u2019s leeching money off of or whatever. You know? But then again he has to have a broad that lives close by. Because Deborah has the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So he can walk to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: But, who knows. Well, you brought up a heck of a lot from the looks of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: Just don\u2019t fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: I can really do without him in my life. At least I\u2019ve been able to save money, you know?

She was up for Thanksgiving, not for Christmas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Oh, I thought she was coming up for \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: No. There\u2019s something going on in that house and she won\u2019t tell me what. I had talked to her on the phone like two weeks before Christmas and I said to her, \u2018make sure you, when you\u2019re out at the mall that you get your mother a Christmas card and we\u2019ll mail it to her. \u2018Okay, Nana, I will.\u2019 Not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F71\">a fucking Christmas card. Not even a phone call Christmas day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: How did it go between the two of them when she was up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Good. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: So this was kind of out of the blue that she didn\u2019t send a card or call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: Didn\u2019t call.

So I says to Deborah, I said, \u2018I hate to say this Deborah, but she\u2019s not coming up in March.\u2019 No. You know? I said, you know, when she finally did reach out to her mother -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: She did. She did finally contact her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Ye<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think Deborah said that the only alternative she had was to call the police and make a well being check. Because if something happened to them \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: Were you guys trying to call her at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, we did. We left messages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: And she wasn\u2019t getting back to you. Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: What did you think was happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: At that point I didn\u2019t give a fuck I was so hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: You thought it was her not getting back to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Nothing else. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But like Deborah says, if anything happens to them while they\u2019re out on the \u2013 you know, the whole family\u2019s out, no one\u2019s going to call us and let us know. You know? So we\u2019d be up shit\u2019s creek, you know? So Darla wrote back in a letter, in the e-mail \u2013 \u2018go ahead and call the police. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B1\">would only make matters worse here.\u2019 So, I wrote back and I said, \u2018are you father and Ella getting along?\u2019 Is there a lot of fighting going on in the house?\u2019 She wrote back, \u2018no.\u2019 And oh, I didn\u2019t take my cell phone with me at all times. Shit, when she was up here, that cell phone was glued to her fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B2\">ear, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Just to step back for a second \u2013 how was it when she left, between everybody? I mean, how was she with everybody?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: Fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: Nothing \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: No. She was looking forward to coming up for March vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: Were you talking to her after that, before Christmas but after her visit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: How was it then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: Fine. She let me know when her school vacation started so I could get the tickets and stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But then Christmas. You don\u2019t hear a peep until finally Deborah writes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: Who did she write? She wrote \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: To Darla.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: Darla. Darla wrote back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah. \u2018Go ahead, it would only make matters worse.\u2019 So what do you think \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: But she didn\u2019t say anything about not getting in contact with you or not talking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: No. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Oh boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">CLIENT: So she said to Deborah, \u2018I\u2019m not home at all.

[0:25:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: No, because Darla has he own phone and Ella has her phone. You know, they all have phone numbers.

Ella said, \u2018sure, fine.\u2019 She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F1\">out with her friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: Okay, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: But you know, I don\u2019t know maybe if Ella is pissed that, you know, I didn\u2019t do anything for her kids like I used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">CLIENT: And of course she was very sneaky, my granddaughter. When she went home in November she went home with over $300. So we sent her Christmas cards like two weeks before Christmas because of how the post office works. Well, Heath kept them, I think, thinking that her money was in the Christmas <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201671\">cards. That there was a check in there for her. So he didn\u2019t give them to her until Christmas day. Well, he must have shit when there was nothing in them. He probably said to Darla, what, your grandmother didn\u2019t send you a check? And she said, \u2018no, Nana gave me all my money in November when I came back <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201672\">up from school.\u2019 You know? Whether Ella got pissed because I didn\u2019t send her kids like $10, $20, $25 like I used to. But hey.

She can\u2019t stand Heath\u2019s mother anymore. But then again she never could. She\u2019s just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">THERAPIST: Are you on good enough terms to ask Ella that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah, I am. But I don\u2019t know \u2013 she\u2019s not happy living there. When she leaves here she doesn\u2019t want to go home. Does not want to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">THERAPIST: You know, who knows. It could be any number of things. It could be that it\u2019s very hard for her to be apart from her mom and you know, might feel some anger towards Deborah. Who knows? But it sounds like there\u2019s something going on with Darla for certain. I think you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yes. There\u2019s something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">THERAPIST: And maybe something at the home, too, that she\u2019s \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve asked her that and she will not give me a correct answer. She says no, it\u2019s not, but she\u2019s at the age now where she can emancipate herself, so I mean if that was me, I would have been out of the house like a long time ago. I mean like my father treated me like shit. I couldn\u2019t wait to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Well I think the difference is that you would have done it. I don\u2019t think Darla has the makeup that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">THERAPIST: I think you would have been daring enough to do it.

I don\u2019t think he did because Darla hasn\u2019t mentioned it to her mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: And he never got in contact with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: No. No. With my luck he probably ripped it up anyways.

But what about Darla not calling you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: No. No, she\u2019s a \u2013 she knows that when her, when my mother died she was very upset that he did not go to his grandmother\u2019s wake. Very upset over it. Didn\u2019t want anything to do with them after that. And that\u2019s the way, well then Deborah and Ella got into a big fight. Nobody heard from her anyway, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B1\">you know.

I guess I\u2019m, you know, it made me think about, oh yeah, Heath, who was gone. You tried give him various olive branches for him to take to call and he doesn\u2019t take it and you kind of know that. But this is very different for Darla <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D1\">not to call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: And it must just kick up a lot of rejection for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Bitter pill to swallow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: She knows where everything comes from \u2013 that goes to her is from me, you know. Not me and Deborah, you know? Because she knows her mother doesn\u2019t have a pot to piss in. So it\u2019s like, okay, not even a fuck them. You know, a five second phone call. Merry Christmas! You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: And you guys called her, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yes.

I says to Deborah, \u2018I\u2019m not buying the fucking plane ticket. I don\u2019t give a shit if you tell her and tell her the reason why. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">THERAPIST: I guess there\u2019s a couple of things. One is that, you know, something. What is going on with her not contacting you at all? Is she upset? Is she mad? Is she sad? Why wouldn\u2019t she call? And two \u2013 if she, whatever she\u2019s feeling, why can\u2019t she call anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">CLIENT: Anyway? You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, at least on Christmas. Yeah.

Your boyfriend? Use his cell phone.

I says, \u2018you\u2019re going to getting a yearbook. I says, I will pay for that. I said I want your pictures for your senior year. I said, if you want a class ring I\u2019ll pay for that, Darla. I said, if you want to go to a prom, I\u2019ll pay for your dress and whatever else you need. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E71\">Just say so. You know?

He\u2019s always wanted to make it that they can\u2019t afford all of them. And the other two kids \u2013 if they\u2019re not getting something from you then it\u2019s not fair to them. So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Okay, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">CLIENT: I mean, fuck \u2018em.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but he\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s been something strange about that, too, about \u2013 I would imagine there\u2019s some sort of feeling of boy, look at what she\u2019s able to give them that we can\u2019t and because she should be able to have things from you that are special that the other kids don\u2019t have because she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F11\">your granddaughter. And she\u2019s got to have that be a part of her life. Yeah, I would at some point get to this with Darla. Why didn\u2019t she call and what is happening? You know, this is really upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">CLIENT: And I said to Deborah, tell her she\u2019s not coming up in March, you know?
