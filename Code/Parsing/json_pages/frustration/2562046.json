As I think about it, I think it is clear to me why this would kind of be a nightmare situation at work. [Pauses] You hate dealing with other people [chuckles] when you\u2019re at work. Even if it is somebody \u2013 you go to get something for somebody, and they want to talk for half an hour, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">or you go to lunch and kind of get absorbed by that for a while. You often really don\u2019t like to do things that way; you like to stay focused on what you have to do, and that stuff kind of distracts you and throws you. And this woman is going to be in your face for two days. That sounds totally not like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B72\">your kind of [chuckles] thing. [Pauses for five seconds] I guess I\u2019m just thinking, \u201cWell, of course you\u2019re dreading it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">[Silence from 00:31:01 to 00:31:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I would imagine it is going to be very hard to get anything else done [pauses] or to really have time to reorient on the things you need to do.
