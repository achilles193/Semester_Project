I actually had a cancellation so it worked out perfectly that you could move to this spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s great. Let\u2019s see, well it was\u2026 so taxes. I did taxes this last... well I was going to do a month Friday\u2026 I did the month Friday night. Jeremy\u2019s brother sent\u2026 his wife was going to a bachelorette party. Jeremy invited his brother over. And it\u2019s hard for me. There\u2019s lots of drama going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">on, whether Christina\u2019s being a good mother or whether she\u2019s overloading Ozzie [ph?] and making\u2026 spreading him too thin, giving him equal baby responsibilities but not equal total team responsibilities. [1:05] So that might be taking care of the baby and doing all of the cooking and the dog watching <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">and the\u2026 so I mean I had some observations and sort of\u2026 but it\u2019s hard because the mom says something, Jeremy says stuff to me, and I have my own opinions. But it\u2019s\u2026 I mean I do feel bad because it does seem that even though they\u2019ve talked about it, one person does have a larger portion of the work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">and especially if [inaudible] personal experience with Christina wanting me to come over on Fridays and spend time with the baby, which I\u2019m working on Friday. I mean I don\u2019t mind spending time with the baby Friday night but she meant during the day, and she\u2019s had\u2026 I mean just making sort of the assumption <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">or extrapolating from her bringing the baby into the office on Fridays and then leaving to do chores. [2:15] I don\u2019t want to\u2026 I mean I guess I\u2019m personally impacted by this as well so I mean I guess I do feel I have a say in what I think is fair or not, or whether\u2026 my personal opinion. But anyway, he <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">came over on Friday and we gave him dinner. Made tacos, which was really fun. And it was nice. I got to hold the baby and I mean the baby didn\u2019t seem to mind me. He didn\u2019t seem to be too interested. I have to admit I\u2019m more of a three year old toddler sort of\u2026 that\u2019s sort of where I\u2026 my interests come, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">rather than babies. But I wanted to at least tend to the baby while Ozzie [ph?] and Jeremy were making cocktails in the kitchen. So I feel I was doing my Auntly duties and I was\u2026 the cats were sniffing the baby and sitting near it. So I felt\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a totally bad Aunt. It\u2019s hard to say. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200117\">I don\u2019t feel\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You feel like people are saying you\u2019re a totally bad Aunt? [3:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Well Christina said that she doesn\u2019t\u2026 she wants me to spend more time with the baby so that it gets to know his Aunt. And every time when we go out with them they\u2019re always like hold the baby, hold the baby. You don\u2019t want to hold the baby? And I\u2019m like well, I mean the baby\u2019s\u2026 I can hold the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">baby. I don\u2019t particularly want to. It\u2019s nothing against the baby. It\u2019s just babies are rather fragile. I mean not that fragile but I mean I\u2019d rather hold a cat, but not like a baby kitten, like a too, too tiny kitten. I just\u2026 I mean I just don\u2019t feel any warm and fuzzy feeling. I guess I\u2019ll say that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">But I can understand once the baby gets a little bit older I\u2019ll feel a little bit more closeness to it. So [inaudible] being a bad Aunt but I think Christina puts a little pressure on me for spending time with the baby. And I feel like why are you doing this. I mean I don\u2019t demand her to come over and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">spend time with my cats. And I mean I guess cats are a little bit different but I mean there\u2019s a long time for that, the child to grow up, and I don\u2019t know exactly how to say Fridays are really busy but you\u2019re welcome to come over Friday night, or maybe that might\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561921\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: That sounds fine. I mean I think her desire to want her baby to be connected to\u2026 is it a boy or girl? [5:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: His Aunt and Uncle, I can understand that. But it was their decision to have a child, not your decision to have a niece or nephew. And your life goes on. So I think being respectful of your schedule and your job. Just because you don\u2019t have to punch a time clock doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">have to commit time to your work. And your work schedule didn\u2019t change when she had the baby, so I think saying Fridays I really need to devote to work, but Friday nights or another time that works for you I\u2019d be happy to have you guys over to come spend some time. That\u2019s perfectly acceptable and lovely. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">Not everyone\u2019s world has to revolve around baby\u2019s needs. Hers does right now. And maybe Ozzie\u2019s [ph?] too, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I guess I\u2019ll use that because [inaudible] going down to Vermont for Easter and spending time with the whole family. [6:24] It\u2019s always sort of a\u2026 I mean it\u2019s\u2026 I know when Jeremy spends time with my family he probably gets a little exhausted from the intertentions and\u2026 but I feel that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">with\u2026 I mean I guess spending time with every\u2026 I mean I sort of feel that every family is sort of dysfunctional in a functional way, and just when you grow up with that family you\u2019re used to that dysfunction so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: And you know how to work around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: But so I\u2019m curious just to see how that goes. It should go fine. I mean it\u2019s Easter and it\u2019s\u2026 actually, Easter\u2019s my favorite holiday. I\u2026 because I love\u2026 well it might have been because our mom had us do\u2026 gave us Easter bunnies, and the colors and the season and how we had an Easter dinner and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">we went to church. And it\u2019s actually\u2026 it\u2019s fun because Jeremy and I were going to go to a long orthodox Seder. And it was actually funny. The rabbi took Jeremy aside when he came to my\u2026 Kitty\u2019s, Jeremy\u2019s mother\u2019s, birthday, and he was like what\u2019s the deal with Suzanne. [7:43] And Jeremy was like well <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">she\u2019s not Jewish and he\u2019s like well obviously but... he\u2019s like what\u2026 why is she so interested. And Jeremy passed on, essentially, my message is that it\u2019s part of Jeremy\u2019s background and I want to be able to share that with my children someday. It\u2019s being able to answer questions and give them the traditions <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">that Jeremy likes celebrating and being able to know about them. And the rabbi was like okay. But I guess he just wanted to know why I was so curious because I actually wanted to see the rabbi in a more frequent, maybe once a month, and (pause) [inaudible] but I mean and I just\u2026 I sort of feel\u2026 I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">there\u2019s two parts of me. One that\u2019s very enthusiastic about\u2026 to rekindle religion, and the other part that\u2019s just exhausted. And that sort of came up this weekend when I was doing my taxes late into the night and I was\u2026 Jeremy fell asleep on me. [9:03] I\u2026 taxes are just very stressful because I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200215\">have\u2026 half of my year\u2019s a W2 if I teach, and the other half\u2019s a scholarship, and how I put away scholarship money is kind of a fluid thing, how much I\u2019m saving. And it doesn\u2019t help that Jeremy, he skipped three paychecks, and so he\u2019s been really tense about money. And I actually had to have him pay <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200216\">my Rhode Island tax return and that was\u2026 I was just really sensitive about that because I know he\u2019s really touchy about money right now. And then we kind of\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t know if it was just in the morning when I woke up, whether I was touchy, but I wound up just crying when\u2026 and I was just\u2026 I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200217\">crying quite a bit when he told me that I\u2026 he was getting on my case that we didn\u2019t have any paper in the printer when he brought some home, and I didn\u2019t tell him that we were out or\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t know how we ran out or when we had paper. I just remember printing three or four pages and being out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200218\">of paper. I don\u2019t remember. [10:28] I think it was just\u2026 I was asking him for money. He gets a little tense. So how much do I need and what\u2019s your finances and how much are your taxes, and it\u2019s just all such a delicate thing. I mean in one sense it\u2019s typical because we\u2019re still operating on\u2026 well I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200219\">have two bank accounts, which is\u2026 it\u2019s kind of an artifact of the past, and he has a bank account. And so how money is distributed, it\u2019s all sort of random. And how much I\u2019m giving him per month. And it\u2019s a lot of variables. And I mean I think I get frustrated when\u2026 I mean because I already feel guilty. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002110\">I sometimes feel like I\u2019m frivolous with money. And I mean for many years I was able to pay my taxes. I guess I was just\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 when I was responsible for everything I had to live within my means because there was no buffer. And now, here, if it was $700 that I was lacking for taxes, I\u2026 last year I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002111\">was lacking that much so\u2026 because he\u2019s kind of a cushion. But it just sort of\u2026 it wasn\u2019t\u2026 after I was exhausted and I\u2019d done my taxes, which were more, much more, than last year, I don\u2019t know why, I still don\u2019t know why. Anyway, but it was just\u2026 it was\u2026 so I started crying, and it wasn\u2019t a\u2026 and I got <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002112\">a message from my Dad, hello, is this your same number. [12:25] Mom and Dad have been trying to reach you. We miss you. And I was just sort of thinking about if it was\u2026 I\u2019ve been meaning to call my parents but I was just really exhausted. I\u2019m [inaudible] and at least two racquetball classes for a week <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002113\">and trying to get work done and yet I\u2019m just\u2026 and I had this one girl, she gave me a letter of recommendation Friday night and wanted me to have it done on the 15th, today.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561921\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: She wanted you to write it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she gave me a letter as a rough draft, and so I\u2019m currently just fixing it really quick, just because, I mean, there\u2019s limited time. And I went to see my advisor today. That\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m going to have that until the Seder to work on it. But I mean I was just freaking out because it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">there\u2019s so much to be done and it\u2019s taking forever. And my parents are wondering where I am, Jeremy\u2019s mad at me for doing this, this, and this around... because he gets\u2026 he calls himself OCD clean, and in a sense he\u2019s not OCD clean or else he\u2019d be cleaning the wall [ph?] a lot more often, which I do. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">[13:41] But he is sort of very persnickety about things being left out and he can get kind of harsh. I mean I guess it\u2019d be different if I were a kid, but if I\u2019m along his age, I mean I could\u2026 I mean I\u2019ve gotten better about the toilet paper, and I do do that, and the tissues, replacing those. I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200253\">have a hard time when things need to be replaced or I just\u2026 it\u2019s not top of my priority list. And so I just felt like he was attacking me by just not being very nice about the paper and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561921\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re upset that he feels like he\u2019s the only one that does it, or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. He feels that he\u2019s sort of the only one that takes responsibility for the paper. He ordered the ink and he was doing this so people can print out stuff. And I mean I can understand. I\u2026 the printer, I sort of ignore. Sometimes it has paper, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, and that might be just\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200291\">I mean I haven\u2019t changed the ink on that machine for seven years. [15:01] It\u2019s been going good until just recently. And with paper, I mean it\u2019s just\u2026 I sort of\u2026 I mean I guess there have been little things that I\u2019ve been sort of using the last of. I do use the last of\u2026 almost the last of the sugar but\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200292\">and I didn\u2019t tell Jeremy because I didn\u2019t know I needed sugar. I normally just get sugar when I need it. But I didn\u2019t know that he was making simply syrup or\u2026 and so I think that was it, the sugar and the paper. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So part of it is communication. And lack of sleep, it looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You may be feeling partly overwhelmed because it sounds like, yeah, a lot of people are sort of wanting things from you. Christina\u2019s wanting time from you for the baby, Jeremy\u2019s wanting you to really notice sort of some of these details and communicate with him and take more responsibility, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">it sounds like. Your mom and dad want you to pay attention to them. Everybody\u2019s wanting things from you, and it sounds like you\u2019re feeling exhausted. You clearly didn\u2019t get enough sleep last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: I got to bed earlier. I got to bed at 1:00.

Well it takes a while to reset that sort of sleep deprivation that you have accumulated. And I know, also, you\u2019re switching your schedule. But yeah, I mean it sounds like you feel overwhelmed. There\u2019s a lot of people wanting things from you, and not having enough time to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">do all the things that you want to do, whether it be racquetball classes or sleep or focus on your own work. [16:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean I guess\u2026 and sometimes I get frustrated because Jeremy needs these motivational talks probably like every other day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: For you to motivate him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: About work, but it\u2019s going to\u2026 things are going to come through and that he doesn\u2019t need to worry about this. And I mean of course we talk about all the intricacies, but I mean Jeremy\u2026 I mean I think he\u2019s putting a lot of pressure on himself to be the main provider. And he got mad when I told <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">my mom that he hasn\u2019t gotten three months\u2019 pay and so money has been tight. And he felt really ashamed and upset because then my parents might think that he\u2019s not able to provide for me. And I was like listen, we\u2019re a team here. I was like right now I\u2019m\u2026 I guess I sort of\u2026 it\u2019s just an interesting sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">of way of thinking about it, providing for me, because I\u2019ve provided for myself for many years on my own salary. I mean I definitely live a better lifestyle than if I wasn\u2019t with him. For sure I\u2019d probably do a lot more shopping at than I do now. [17:57] But yeah, I just\u2026 I get frustrated because when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D3\">he\u2019s like\u2026 he comes home stressed and he needs someone to talk to and then unwind, I\u2019m like what about me. I\u2019m stressed. I mean I don\u2019t want to talk about it but I was like here I\u2019m spending all this time motivating and ensuring that things are going to turn out, and in my mind it\u2019s a real push. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D4\">a real push for me to say these things because I don\u2019t think\u2026 in terms of research I\u2019m like\u2026 I get frustrated and\u2026 but in some\u2026 when push comes to shove I know that I can make up something at least to happen or occur or\u2026 I mean I guess in my mind it\u2019s just sort of you work every day. You work hard and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561921\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s\u2026 your expectation of what the day would be like is different than his.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess I just\u2026 I feel like I put up with a lot more in terms of the commute, because generally it\u2019s not as straightforward as his commute. Even though there could be traffic there\u2019s not multiple switching of vehicles and interaction with the public. But sometimes that can be amusing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">There was a guy on the subway that\u2026 he was staggering around drunk and then he entered this\u2026 supposedly it\u2019s supposed to be locked, but it\u2019s the cabbie of the subway. And he peed in there while we were just all scared that he was going to blow something up or\u2026 but it was just his pee leaking on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200412\">ground, which I credited myself with being disgusted but everyone else was disgusted. At least my stuff was not sitting on the floor like some people\u2019s. [19:55] But anyway, that\u2026 so\u2026 and Jeremy\u2019s done\u2026 actually he started picking me up at nights because I\u2019ll be working late in my office. Part of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200413\">is I just need that space to\u2026 once I get going. And the girl that I was\u2026 it doesn\u2019t help that I haven\u2019t had any coffee today. The girl that I was tutoring, she seemed fine with me picking problems. I felt a lot better. And then that was another thing with picking problems. It did take me a long time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200414\">And of course I\u2019m going to mark down how long I spent searching for the problems and finding their answer, preparations. But I mean I was happy that she seemed like oh, these are great questions. Some of them were actually pretty difficult. (yawn) Sorry, I\u2019ve got to keep it together. I\u2019ve got to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200415\">it together. But I mean and now it\u2019s sort of\u2026 I felt good because I sort of set the boundaries to my comfort level. I mean without having to ask. And I think the thing is, is that my mind just starts to over worry about what if. It goes in a negative spiral when I get scared or feel like something\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200416\">not right; it just keeps on thinking and thinking and thinking, and fast forwards to cops coming to my door and saying\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so we have to watch for when you start to kind of predict the future in a catastrophic way. Think about what\u2019s realistic here. What\u2019s your worst fear? Your worst fear is probably not the most likely outcome. [21:40] And that\u2019s doing some of that reality checking and noticing I\u2019m getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200431\">pretty catastrophic here, let\u2019s think about what\u2019s more realistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561921\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean and that\u2019s how\u2026 I was supposed to mail a letter today but I actually just forgot it. I mean I had it out. I didn\u2019t mean to forget it; I just totally was running late today. But I didn\u2019t mail my taxes and that was a\u2026 I didn\u2019t have much time to think about it just because today\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200451\">yesterday was such a busy day. But I\u2019m trying to get better at mailing and writing letters because I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, confronting that fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20049\">CLIENT: And Jeremy\u2026 bless Jeremy\u2019s heart. I have him reread my letters and verify. Okay, I\u2019m going to close the envelope. Is that okay? He\u2019s like yes; yes it\u2019s fine. And so I mean I\u2019m going to try and get to the point where he doesn\u2019t have to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Where you can trust yourself. You need a good goal to think about writing it. I mean you be the person that rereads it once, and then letting it go because that way, if you can work toward that, what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re teaching yourself to tolerate a little bit of the anxiety rather than <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B1\">finding a solution that sort of makes it go away for you. [23:01] Because even though it feels like a relief when he reads it and says it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re sort of teaching yourself that you can\u2019t be trusted, that you need somebody else to okay it, to check it, that you\u2019re not letting yourself trust your <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B2\">own judgment. And then sit with whatever anxiety there is that your [inaudible] wasn\u2019t right and then move on from it. And just like with hand washing, when you were worried that there was something, some sort of contaminant, whether you would transmit something to someone or you had picked up something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B3\">gross, by washing your hands repeatedly it feels\u2026 you get that relief in the moment as soon as you washed them but it doesn\u2019t teach you to kind of just let yourself be done and [inaudible] and if this\u2026 with e-mails or letter writing it\u2019s the same thing. Him checking it is like you washing your hands <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B4\">again. So you want to see if you can set what\u2019s an appropriate stance, which is washing once, which is rereading once, and then, yeah, you\u2019re going to feel anxious when you let it go for sure, but if you can do that over and over, the anxiety will subside just like it did with hand washing. And you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B5\">able to leave the bathroom now after washing once and not feel like you really need to go back. [24:14] That\u2019s, I think, what you want to work toward, is finding what\u2019s reasonable and what\u2019s also teaching you, give yourself the message that your judgment is good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">CLIENT: No, and that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s really paid off, really paid off for me just to wash my hands once. And even when I\u2019m around the house and baking something, I still want to rewash my hands because I\u2019m like oh, no, and then I just have to take a deep breath and realize that it\u2019s going to be okay. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a difference between good hygiene and obsessive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, and plus the time that it takes, and the worrying. I mean I sort of go back\u2026 I mean I\u2019ve gone\u2026 and I think\u2026 I really credit myself just because Christina gets on my case for eating on the subway and not washing my hands. Are you sure, you know how gross it is. I\u2019m just well, I\u2019m not laying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">on the poles and licking the poles. Maybe I\u2019m touching them but I mean everyone has different standards. It\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561921\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20053\">THERAPIST: You seem to be okay. [25:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think maybe that\u2019s sort of my problem. Sometimes Christina will\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20057\">THERAPIST: Sounds like you have some people in your life that reinforce extremes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, or sometimes it feels like she\u2019s kind of picking on me, like ewww, why would you do that. And I\u2019m just like it doesn\u2019t matter. And so I mean I don\u2019t know how to respond when people say that and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Well I wouldn\u2019t. And you don\u2019t have to answer the question. How can you do that? I\u2019m cool with it. And I think it sounds like Jeremy has some extreme tendencies as well, and it sounds like Christina does as well. And finding your own limit of what\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a range of what\u2019s normal, big <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B1\">range of what\u2019s safe, and it\u2019s okay to be in there, that you don\u2019t have to be to the extreme end. Good enough is good enough. And there\u2019s some benefits to having the flexibility, to not having to perform things to a really extreme end. And I don\u2019t think\u2026 you don\u2019t have to have an answer for Christina <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B2\">because those kinds of questions are very judgmental, and letting it go unanswered or pointing out like oh, that sounds like a really judgmental question is a fine answer of setting\u2026 of\u2026 because that\u2019s also setting your boundary. You don\u2019t get to evaluate my choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, that actually\u2026 because then you\u2019re not\u2026 I guess because she constantly does it over and over, and she\u2019ll bring it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Is this new with baby or heightened with baby?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">CLIENT: No, it just\u2026 Christina and I didn\u2019t really talk before or share things. [27:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">THERAPIST: Because sometimes people\u2019s sort of fears of viruses and germs can get heightened when they have a baby, and rightly so. Baby doesn\u2019t have an immune system that\u2019s built up like an adult\u2019s is, so sometimes you [inaudible] a little bit more\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">CLIENT: More, yeah\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">THERAPIST: \u2026observant and worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: Well I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re an adult with a developed immune system that can handle lots of whatever\u2019s floating around out there on the T.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I will say\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And your body\u2019s designed to fight against it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: When I\u2019m around the baby I do make sure I wash my hands before I touch the baby. I think that\u2019s definitely reasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because it\u2019s a baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean they were thinking about installing hand sanitizer stations in the house but\u2026 and making sure that everyone had their flu shot before they saw the baby. I mean these are\u2026 there\u2019s nothing wrong with these things. I guess that\u2019s their standards. But I didn\u2019t get my flu shot just because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200751\">I have a fear of getting the flu shot. I\u2019d rather just ignore it and just make sure that when I\u2019m around the baby [inaudible] go to the bathroom and wash my hands. So\u2026 and they haven\u2019t said anything about that. They don\u2019t question\u2026 I mean sometimes they\u2026 anytime someone goes to pick up the baby they <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200752\">put some hand sanitizer in their hands. But I can understand. [28:51] That\u2019s their boundaries and it has to do with that they\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s their kid; they get to make decisions about their kid. But she\u2026 but for you putting a\u2026 the boundary there, where she can ask that you to do certain things because she wants to protect her newborn versus commenting on what you do for yourself as an adult. You\u2019re not taking\u2026 you\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200771\">feeding a baby on the T. The baby\u2019s not touching stuff anyway. But putting a limit there. She can, if she wants to, install hand sanitizers in her house and make sure people use them before they touch her kid; that\u2019s her stuff. But it doesn\u2019t need to transfer over into your stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561921\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that\u2019s\u2026 I mean that\u2019s one reason why I was talking to my parents. I do\u2026 I mean my parents are sort of dysfunctional in their own way, but I sort of feel that they\u2019re a little bit more relaxed on these things. And it\u2019s nice. I sort of have a general\u2026 they\u2019re definitely more\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200791\">I think they see the bigger picture with some of these\u2026 and they don\u2019t see the bigger picture in all areas so I guess no one\u2019s perfect, but those sort of things that I try to convince myself not to worry about or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It feels like they have a fairly realistic view of that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think maybe that just might be a thing of upbringing or just\u2026 but I think that\u2019s a very smart idea, is just\u2026 I mean because I don\u2019t tell her I think you should be breastfeeding or I mean those sort of boundaries. I realize that if she wants to raise the kid a certain way, I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D1\">I\u2019ll respect those if it has to do with me, but I don\u2019t bring up judgmental questions like why don\u2019t you do. I mean I never do. I just don\u2019t ask people those\u2026 I just\u2026 I\u2026 in the big picture of things, as long as it doesn\u2019t involve me, I could care very little. [30:43] I mean if it\u2019s a friend I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D2\">to care for their well-being but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: But also using that same sort of barometer of there\u2019s a wide range of what\u2019s okay. It might not be the same as what you choose, but if it\u2019s okay, if she were harming the child or if you felt like the child was at risk, then there\u2019s a limit where you might want to step in and say I\u2019m concerned. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F1\">But these are not\u2026 breastfed, bottle fed, both are okay. No one\u2019s being harmed there. Those are choices and\u2026 or sanitizer or no sanitizer, choices that are probably both okay. So using that same standard for yourself and others because I think you can sometimes be a harsh critic of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah and that\u2019s\u2026 yeah, I mean and that\u2019s\u2026 and I think that\u2019s really what boiled down on Saturday, is that I cried twice that day and just\u2026 I told Jeremy, I was like I felt bad because I said that sometimes he\u2019s the antagonist of me feeling overwhelmed. I mean it\u2019s true. Sometimes\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, just a sort of expectations and making sure that he gets out for walks. And there\u2019s so much that I do to make\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: You feel like you get put in charge of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, and to make his\u2026 I mean I do enjoy spending time with him but there\u2019s some\u2026 I guess I\u2019m sort of at the point of my PhD where I just sort of feel like I just kind of want to rot\u2026 or not rot with my sciences but just sort of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You can put the blinders on and focus on one thing. Yeah, I wonder if you could do that. [32:26] It\u2019s not forever but are there some things that you can cut out so you can sort of put the blinders on to some of these more peripheral things, so that you can finish this up and get it done. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">We need to wrap up. And I wanted to share from last time. So this book, I want to caution, it has some really good information but I want to caution you that it is\u2026 they wrote it for a younger audience than you and Jeremy, so some of the language feels sort of young a little bit. I don\u2019t want you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B2\">feel condescended to, but the actual information is pretty good. It\u2019s written in a straightforward way.

Sometimes we skip one. [35:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">CLIENT: Let\u2019s see, in May maybe we could do three.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: How about we do 13th, 20th and 27th, unless you\u2019re going away for Memorial Day weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m not going away for Memorial Day weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s do that.

Parents always want to do what they <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D11\">think is best, so I can understand. Thank you so much for fitting me in. That was very kind and I really appreciate it. It really does\u2026 coming to therapy on a regular schedule does really\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m making more progress. But I guess that\u2019s sort of generally how therapy is. You can\u2019t just go once <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D12\">a year and work on things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Doesn\u2019t have quite the same affect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">CLIENT: All right, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Thank you.
