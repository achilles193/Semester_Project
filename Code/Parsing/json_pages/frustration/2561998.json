Anything to push us along a little bit, or push me. I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve got a head full of things kind of swirling around?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(Pause): [0:01:51 \u2013 0:02:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: My mother\u2019s visit is kind of, you know, like while she\u2019s here she sucks up a lot of the \u2013 I mean, whatever, she\u2019s over at our place as are we for most of the day, so Jennie (sp?) I guess is no longer going to start classes tomorrow but \u2013 so there\u2019s a lot of my mother. Grayson is just sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">kind inching toward some kind of critical mass. He responds to things in his environment. I guess it\u2019s a gradual thing and then there are these spurts. He\u2019s in the middle of a growth spurt and I think a developmental spurt, so he\u2019s really excited. We got him a book on, it\u2019s like \u2013 I\u2019m trying to remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">the name of the company that makes these black and white and just primary color, high contrast mobiles \u2013 Ferguson or something like that. Anyway, it\u2019s along those lines. It has a number of black and white images that fan out in an accordion and he totally loves it. He really is able to retain the memory <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">of the ones he enjoys so he\u2019ll look at images in particular and he\u2019ll laugh. So that\u2019s some of the things that are swirling around, I guess. Is that\u2019s pretty fun to watch. And he recognizes our voices. It\u2019s sort of the transition from real neonatal \u2013 it\u2019s also like an isolation chamber or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">In other words, as a neonate, the interaction with the external environment is relatively limited it seems to me and interaction with the internal environment is very almost absolute \u2013 if that\u2019s a good way of putting it. But I see him gradually kind of opening his mind and his consciousness outward <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">and that\u2019s very exciting to watch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Maybe 10 or 11 weeks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: He is going on 12 weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(Pause): [0:04:53 0:05:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: My mother is really getting what she came for. We talked about that a little bit. She\u2019s really very, very happy and happy to spend time with him and happy to be a part of the household for a little while. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s true that I find her a disruptive presence. I think Jennie does <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">but I don\u2019t know that things run less well with her here. I feel kind of, in contrast to last week, I feel, I feel kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(Pause): [0:06:03 0:06:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes, depressed, I mean for lack of better words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(Pause): [0:06:17 0:06:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Blunted. And I\u2019m not sure what to make of that. I don\u2019t feel like the things that I want to do are realistic or meaningful and I guess I feel kind of depressed. I don\u2019t know how much of it has to do with my mother being around all the time and how much it has to do with just the intrinsic difficulty <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">of the situation and how much it has to do with some other phenomenon but I feel kind of depressed as I would understand it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause): [0:07:17 0:07:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: One interesting thing that I noticed actually that may be the one kind of pointed thing that\u2019s swirling around has to do with \u2013 there have been these moments where I\u2019ve felt very irritated or hurt, maybe more specifically, by Jennie. Often without much cause and she\u2019s been very sweet and actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">we\u2019ve been very sweet together, actually, there\u2019s nothing overtly that I can point to at least, tension in our relationship right now, but I\u2019ve felt irritated. So there\u2019s something going on. And last night she has Lewis, her friend initially, who has Crohn\u2019s and it was flaring up and so she was not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">feeling too well, and Jennie had said for a while that she wanted to go over and spend some time with her and so the reason I\u2019ve been begrudging, my conscious kind of understanding had been, you know, she has classes to prepare for and she has to finish the syllabi and I\u2019m not sure how much of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B3\">is volitional and how much is just our dynamic but I felt like I\u2019d kind of been cast in the role of pushing her a little bit to do it and she does the same with me. And so she said, \u2018oh, yeah, so and so wants to get together and so and so wants to get together and I said why don\u2019t you wait until after <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B4\">the first day of classes and then do this push and you can hang out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561998\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">Anyway, she ended up going to see her and I think because she wanted to get out the door and time away, I guess, she went to put Grayson to bed and it took a while and I said, well okay, I\u2019ll cook dinner and it wasn\u2019t like a special dinner, really. I went to Trader Joe\u2019s and I got some frozen risotto <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">mix and cooked it a little bit on the stovetop so it wasn\u2019t like a microwave operation, but you know, still prefabricated risotto mix and we had some frozen sea scallops which were very nice and I kind of saut\u00e9ed them in a \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t, I guess what I mean to say is it is a tasty dinner but it wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">like haute cuisine, you know. It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d been cooking for two hours and so my mom comes in and I say, when should we eat? And I\u2019d been saying this for \u2013 because I really wanted to eat together because I guess that\u2019s important to me. My mom had said we eat a little late for her. Could we eat <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">around 7? And I said okay. And I asked Jennie at about 4 if we could eat at 7 and she said okay. She\u2019s putting Grayson to bed. It\u2019s like 7:30 and he\u2019s not going down. And I\u2019m like, so should we keep it warm? She\u2019s like, get out of here, I\u2019m trying to put Grayson down. And I got really mad, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">as if \u2013 I don\u2019t really know what the content may have been. I was feeling irritable about many of the things I spoke of a moment ago but I felt really hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">So anyway she noticed this and she was attuned to it and she came in and sat down at dinner and then she took my mother home and went to visit her friend and came back around 11 and she was very sweet. She was very nice and I said let\u2019s lie together on the couch and read for a bit. She said, that sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">great, and the cat came by and wanted to be fed and she said, I\u2019ll just go feed the cat, and she went to feed the cat and I guess she saw some dishes that she had said that she would clean up so she stayed. And I\u2019m sitting there on the couch and I\u2019m feeling very upset. I\u2019m feeling very upset and again <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">as I reflect on it, there wasn\u2019t any particular reason to be upset but I was more than feeling upset. I felt threatened somehow or worried or paranoid as we\u2019ve been using that terminology. I felt that. I felt that thing and so as I was waiting for her I flipped open just this crap movie that I\u2019d been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">watching and I was really into \u2013 this is the point of the story. It was really, really interesting to see the operation of these kinds of behaviors so clearly because I\u2019d reached a point where I was very conscious of there being like this rational \u2013 I don\u2019t know how I want to tag it \u2013 but you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F4\">this kind of thing, this feeling. I was attuned to it. I knew it was going on. I knew it didn\u2019t quite add up if I tried to do the evaluation, do the accounting. And as soon as I opened this thing up, this movie, it switched off and I began, I was just struck at that particular moment as long as it lasted, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F5\">a few seconds really, by how powerful and important the capacity to shut off that worry or just regulation or however you want to put it or think about it, how important that is in my life and how compulsively I kind of gravitate toward activities that can do it at least in the short term. Somehow I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F6\">can substitute things that I really want to be doing, or that kind of a thing, anyway \u2013 it was just really striking. It was just like crystal-clear in a way that it isn\u2019t always.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561998\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: In particular \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Because it shut off. It was so minor or so \u2013 like it was so genuinely unthreatening, it was so superficial. So epiphenomenal that it wasn\u2019t hard to shut it off and because it wasn\u2019t hard to shut it off this activity really made clear what the mechanism was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: And what the motivation for some of the things that had made it hard to do a number of things that I would like to do with my life might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">(Pause): [0:15:15 0:15:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure how that tracks with your model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">(Pause): [0:15:34 0:15:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, the first part seems pretty clear. I\u2019m well aware that in reality the things Jennie was doing, delaying dinner, putting Grayson down, going to see her friend, doing some dishes, feeding the cat, are no big deal and you\u2019re on board with that. And yet, you know, somewhere in you, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">it got irritating and upsetting that she kept paying attention \u2013 like, \u2018I\u2019m here.\u2019 Basically, she kept paying attention to other stuff and not you in one fashion or another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Okay. That\u2019s part of it I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: And (Pause) I guess you have this sort of reaction in a way \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how much you had this at the time and how much it occurs in the retelling, where you know, there\u2019s one part of you that recognizes that it\u2019s really not a big deal, none of these things or all of them taken together, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">and another part that reacts, that\u2019s like not happy in the moment about the situation. I\u2019m not yet sure what to say about the shutting it off which I\u2019m aware is the point, really that you are making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">(Pause): [0:17:34 0:18:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: There may be a \u2013 I did have in mind another point about this though which is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">(Pause): [0:18:37 0:19:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You seem to have been more animated here in talking about what happened. You initially had trouble knowing where to start or what to say. Then you \u2013 I know you weren\u2019t just referring to it right then but said you\u2019d felt depressed and blunted but I think you were also feeling it at that moment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">My thought is like then when you found some work to do and kind of got into it telling the story it animated you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Work to do \u2013 an area with a beginning, a middle and an end. Sure. Definitely. And there are a lot of different ways. You can think about it in expository terms, you can think about it in, I don\u2019t know, labor theory of value. You know, basically, what is depressing and blunting is the fact of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">being depressed and blunted. In other words, there\u2019s a kind of feedback loop of a sense of disorder that makes it difficult for me to pick out clear threads and the state of mind that leads to such states of disorder. Does that make sense to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561998\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: I think I follow.

That makes sense. I think, I would primarily feeling depressed if \u2013 you haven\u2019t said this, but I guess I sort of (unclear) otherwise guessing you haven\u2019t started working yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been trying, but I haven\u2019t.

In other words, I don\u2019t know. Like I have errant thoughts but I don\u2019t really have a way of organizing them and even \u2013 I\u2019m very troubled by \u2013 I feel very troubled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">(Pause): [0:21:46 0:22:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, in this whole working \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I just feel \u2013 I feel very troubled. Having my mother here is difficult in that regard I think, to some degree. Like when I can pull out the narrative I feel good, I feel efficacious, I feel like I have agency. When I can\u2019t pull out the narrative, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">feel bad, I feel de \u2013 I\u2019m trying to find a non-jargoning way of saying this but you know I just feel kind of enervated. I\u2019ll seek out some other narrative and I don\u2019t know. Right now I\u2019m finding it hard to feel motivated to do something of my very own. That\u2019s part of it too, I guess. I\u2019m finding it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">hard even to feel motivated in our conversation, I guess, in identifying what it is that I imagine would be the outcome of feeling motivated.

I think you do. But I think the feeling of not having a sort of institutional or other work context or home \u2013 I mean it\u2019s always the problem. I\u2019ve got a couple of more parts. One is \u2013 I actually have this sense \u2013 was it last night that you were telling me about with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">Jennie? \u2013 that I may be wrong and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but \u2013 I think you\u2019re pretty clear about it today. I suspect that last night as it was happening, you did not have much insight into what was unfolding and why you were upset and part of the reason I think so is because of how you dealt with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200933\">it which was to turn away from it and towards the movie which you said almost magically did the trick and sort of shut it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Okay. So that\u2019s one piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: But I guess what strikes me is the contrast between you know, how you\u2019re pretty close to it like the insight is very accessible today as we\u2019re talking about it, I think. I mean it\u2019s pretty clear that, you know, not in ways that have realistic significance but in ways that have sort of emotional <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">or fantasy significance, she was turning away from you and that upset you. That seems more accessible today as we\u2019re talking about it but I don\u2019t think it was yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561998\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And the reason I\u2019m making that point is because that\u2019s the thing I feel I don\u2019t understand.

It is kind of extra-modellary \u2013 outside of you, yet in my head it\u2019s something I keep applying and coming back to. And at times like these it feels both separate, I think, and \u2013 yeah, separate, removed to kind of \u2013 it\u2019s a conceptual model out there. It\u2019s like it\u2019s like we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">talking about economics or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Rather than something that\u2019s really much more intimate and I suspect that\u2019s reflective of the state of mind you\u2019re in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Rather than \u2013 you\u2019re saying (unclear) the of the state of the model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">(Pause): [0:37:12 0:37:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So you are in, I think you are a little closer to the first part with what happened with Jennie last night. You know you were animated talking about that and we kind of \u2013 it seems fairly quickly we got our heads around basically what\u2019s going on. It felt more collaborative and had a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">sense it felt not as much outside you, but then when it came to this work stuff that feels very different, it\u2019s more like (unclear) and depressed and shut down and me and my model are on the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">(Pause): [0:37:51 0:38:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: I mean the stuff with Jennie \u2013 at the moment at least, oh, so like there\u2019s not an overt conflict that I\u2019m trying to resolve with Jennie although that\u2019s not really true. The overt conflict is that Jennie has a job and work and a career in the making and I don\u2019t \u2013 and that\u2019s hard. I would say <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">in our relationship right now that\u2019s the thing, so to the extent that I am finding myself a little anguished about even working from soup to nuts, the sort of mechanism of getting stuff done through an institutional setting to whatever, that does inhabit our relationship in a significant way. And maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D12\">not coincidentally, that\u2019s what I was kind of very conscious of feeling in the moment when she was in the room with Grayson and dinner wasn\u2019t happening and she was being kind of short and (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561998\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: I was feeling like I\u2019m being subordinated here.

As I turned this thing off, three seconds <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D92\">later it really occurred to me and I said that\u2019s really something I want to talk to Marshall about tomorrow. So you know, I will push back in that very limited empirical sense a little bit, but I think the larger points that you\u2019re making make a lot of sense to me. I do think that a big part of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D93\">problem we\u2019re struggling with and that I struggle with in psychotherapy quite frankly, you know that makes psychotherapy less satisfying and actually very good at I don\u2019t know \u2013 I feel that I\u2019m pretty good at creating a rapport and creating transference and counter-transference and all of the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D94\">that one needs and thinking analytically, but with sharing (unclear) and so on, I\u2019m not good at remembering (unclear). And that\u2019s a huge problem and I don\u2019t know what to do about it and I\u2019m not quite sure why it would be. I speculate that it has something \u2013 assuming transference and counter-transference, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D95\">it has something to do with the same genre of relationship as the one with my father where I didn\u2019t really own the thing that we were working on together.
