I never gave you this. Here you go. Thank you. (pause) Cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I reconnected with\u2026 there was this girl. I don\u2019t remember. Oh yea, she took me home after I was playing songs or something. And then I was concerned because I was ambivalent about having sex with her or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: This was just maybe like a month or so ago?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yea. February, that\u2019s right so a month ago. So I called her up on a lark. I thought of it because when I first went home with her, it was the day after like my\u2026 it seemed like things were going really well at work. And then\u2026 and my talents had been recognized. I was going to do well, whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">Everyone liked me. And then it kind of fucked me up because I spent the night with her. Just like getting blue balls. (pause) And she just\u2026 yea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So I kind of went to work the next day kind of fucked up. And so recently I was thinking I don\u2019t know I\u2019m not enjoying my work very much. And I felt\u2026 whether or not it\u2019s real I felt this sort of collapse of people supporting me. So I called her up again. I almost went straight from work to her house. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">But I called her up. And so we arranged to meet Wednesday which was yesterday. And so I went over. I brought her flowers because I didn\u2019t want to\u2026 I felt kind of bad about how I left last time. And like also wouldn\u2019t let her sleep and stuff because I was trying to fuck her and it wasn\u2019t happening. (chuckling) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And what else? Oh yea, we talked about (inaudible at 00:03:08) or something ridiculous. So I took up\u2026 I mean, I kept her away my (inaudible at 00:03:14). So I felt bad. So I got flowers. I got like Chinese food and brought it up there after asking her if that\u2019s something she wanted to do. So that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">good. The night was going swimmingly. It was nice to have a warm body really and a fold out, too. I just\u2026 yea, it was nice. (pause) And then I mean, the whole night. I mean, it\u2019s whipping along. We drink a bottle of wine and I wanted to bring Netflix up to watch this particular movie I haven\u2019t seen, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">The Apartment. Have you ever seen The Apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Which\u2026 what year?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Like 1970s or early 80s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Is that Jack Lemmon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yea, it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I saw it a long time ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I have never seen it. I just watched the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I think. I don\u2019t know when I saw it. I was starting to like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I watched Glengarry Glen Ross or something. This movie, it\u2019s really good. I didn\u2019t even know about Jack Lemon until that movie. But I decided to\u2026 I wanted to see another movie but Netflix wouldn\u2019t work because she had\u2026 we bought two or whatever Linux processor so it wouldn\u2019t work on that computer <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">for some reason. But it went all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">Through the night it sort of progressed and I mean, she was sitting on my lap and dancing to whatever jazz music she put on Pandora. And I mean I was just having my way with her basically.  And it was going down on the couch. And she\u2019s got nice nipples like they could get really erect and they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">like sizable, too. I don\u2019t think that happens often. Like you can hold them and also like really kind of\u2026 I don\u2019t know. But I guess\u2026 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563413\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">Gosh, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to say. Yea, I guess I got ambivalent about it or I guess it wasn\u2019t\u2026 I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to go through with sex really. But I mean I\u2019m in these positions where I like to stimulate a woman. And I\u2019ve gotten her bra off and I\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019ve kissed at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">this point or not.  I think her pants are unzipped, too. All this stuff. And I\u2019m just not sure I want to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Was there something about the nipples?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well, I mean it\u2019s an indicator for me of how aroused she is. What do you mean about them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well, I was wondering how you felt about her nipples and what that\u2026 what did you\u2026 I mean, there was something. There\u2019s a sense that she was very aroused and what else, though, to you? I don\u2019t know. It was holding her nipples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Well, I mean I can get through to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: That.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: And she\u2019s also\u2026 she\u2019s open to me. I mean, she\u2019s just lying on the couch with her breasts showing. (pause)  And have nice breasts. That\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I tell you what just came to mind to me about it is that I feel like there\u2019s two lines of\u2026 there\u2019s kind of two important threads that are going on in her mind. That starts I think with something very important, special about turning a woman on and having them be sexually aroused and have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">them want you. Something about being wanted and desired is very important. A feeling of like, \u201cI can do this. This woman is into me. Look it. I\u2019m making her aroused.\u201d That\u2019s very important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">And I thought about then something else enters in for you. Something else opens up for you and so to speak.  And I was thinking it has to do something with\u2026 that\u2026 and I guess that\u2019s why I asked about the nipples was I was thinking about it in terms of like breasts can be sign of, yea, there\u2019s the element <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">of sexual arousal. But there\u2019s also that element of nurturance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Some\u2026 that it\u2019s starting to mean\u2026 not that there\u2019s anything kind of\u2026 or maybe it feels like a conflict between those two things for you. But that\u2026 some other element enters into the scene besides just the feeling of, \u201cI like this feeling of this woman being aroused and interested and excited.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">The breasts made me think about the common symbol of that being linked up with something that\u2019s going to be nurturing, that\u2019s going to be giving. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Right. So yea, I need to impress people and have them want me. And the second thing is a nurturing thing, entering into the nurturing thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yea, but not just being special but having somebody really respond to your sexuality is very important to you. I mean, it\u2019s important to everybody. But I think that\u2019s on the line there for you. But I think this other element, it meant\u2026 started to mean more than that. It started to mean this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">element of something else. I don\u2019t know if it was nurturance or some other element of also what you\u2019re looking for in a woman. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Would that make me stop or ambivalent or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I think it makes\u2026 I think there\u2019s a\u2026 it ends up being more of a conflict. Not that they have to stand in conflict but they just did. Well, again, that\u2019s a hunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. So being needed and needing someone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yea. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I think at work it\u2019s difficult for me. I mean, my bosses really liked me and they promised to do a little bit. But they have\u2026 they want to create like a real relationship with me. And it\u2019s just difficult for me to sustain. It\u2019s all like a performance. It\u2019s\u2026 I just don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not convinced I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">can keep anybody happy with me for any length of time.

What happens? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Well, I recognize they respect me for some reason. And then once you realize that they respect or they\u2019re liking you is something that you value or maybe I should speak in first person but I\u2019m not. Once you realize that they respect or they\u2019re liking you with something you value, then you start <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">kind of compensating for that and trying to\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s not\u2026 I try to avoid it. But if you start to become sort of fake to try and maintain affections in a way, you become dependent on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: You really\u2026 I mean, there\u2019s something about it. You become dependent on it. You really value it. It does have another level of significance to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Simple kindnesses, they obligate me with almost obsequious dependency or thankfulness or like the two sisters who played songs for.  And they were very hospitable. I\u2019m just falling over myself thanking them or feeling sort of abject and in need of thanking or apologizing, maintaining or being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">worthy of someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">With the girl last night, though, with Tatiana, it was\u2026 l mean I\u2019d be kissing her and then I\u2019d be like, oh, this is interesting. This is a new sensation. It\u2019s just you\u2019re feeling it as a different sort of dimension. And then I\u2019d sort of step back and one side of a space of maybe 30 seconds, I\u2019d have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">15 seconds of, oh, this is interesting and 15 seconds of stepping out and saying, oh, this is kind of gross and obligating.  I just\u2026 it\u2019s not like I say, OK, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, tell me about the gross and obligating part. Where did\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: (pause) I mean, somebody\u2019s lips on there. (pause) I mean, you\u2019re supposed to mouth somebody\u2019s lips. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just\u2026 (pause) Sometimes I can communicate some things, sometimes I can\u2019t. So it\u2019s just\u2026 (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">Like you\u2019re writing an essay in school or you\u2019re have a test. You\u2019re taking the SATs. I know they have essays on those. You have to do an essay section. I didn\u2019t but they have them now. And so the first essay kind of speaks to you. It\u2019s something you care about. And then the second essay, you don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">really have a clear take on it. You just kind of\u2026 you have to fill in the words because it\u2019s part of the assignment. So that\u2019s what the kissing was like. It\u2019s like sometimes you feel something or you can go on, you can catch an impulse or an emotion or you can convey something or receive something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">And sometimes it\u2019s just like what the fuck is this? That\u2019s the best way I can describe it, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it\u2019ll feel like\u2026 there are times where the kissing felt like writing the first essay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And then sometimes it\u2019ll feel like writing the second essay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yea.

Really soft.  (pause) She smelled good and all that stuff. I decided we should go into her room and watch a movie and I think she was surprised when I actually started watching the movie. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">I was interested in the movie. And I sort of turned back to her and I\u2019m wavering on this fence. What do I hope to gain? What do I stand to lose? And I guess there\u2019s a risk involved because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll perform well or make her happy. Or I mean, I have no faith that I\u2019ll make myself happy, I guess. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">I just have like a drive in my balls to fuck this woman and not much... (pause) Anyway, eventually she kind of closed down. I mean, we had a lot of physical contact throughout the evening.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yet you were on the fence, though, or wavering back again. (pause) (phone beeping)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry. Hey Diego. (listens) Hello? Hi Diego. (listens) Oh, wonderful. So everything is all set? (listens) So should I come in or what? (listens) Thanks. (pause) I still haven\u2019t sold my car. Sorry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s all right, man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: [I think I\u2019m fired] (ph) the other day at work, too. So I don\u2019t like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well, when I\u2019m\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: This very person we\u2019re talking about now we sort of went through a deal. The guy who crashed his car seemed interested and then when we walked through the deal, walked through the figures and the manager, turned him over to the manager to negotiate price, manager said goodbye.  And I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">to keep him there over at the desk. Well, why? What did you think about et cetera, et cetera? Why do you need to think? Why do this? Why do this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">And what was I going to say? That wasn\u2019t good because the manager is supposed to have the last word or something. It doesn\u2019t matter. I mean, I\u2019m not sure why I got in trouble. For me it\u2019s always just my personality that gets me in trouble if I just\u2026 or it\u2019s my pride or in some way or something. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">not anything in particular. It\u2019s just\u2026 I mean, they\u2019ll say it\u2019s something but it\u2019s actually just I behave\u2026 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563413\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something, too, about him having like the kind of the chain of command kind of thing.  And how you feel in that role and what you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yea. And I\u2019ve become\u2026 I just sit there. I laugh at people\u2019s jokes if they\u2019re above me. I just sit there and don\u2019t know what to do. Just can\u2019t\u2026 the only time I\u2019m free to speak to a customer but you\u2019re not really free. You have to steer them in a certain direction. And I resent this intrusion. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">I really do because I mean I\u2019ve worked maybe ten straight days.

(pause)  I\u2019m just sitting there. Yea, later in the night\u2026 I mean, so she had her robe on which to me I mean that means you\u2019re ready to fuck. You put on a silk robe on. You have nothing on underneath, right? You change into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: It sounds\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: You\u2019re ready to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: \u2026like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m just watching the movie and she\u2019s sort of leaning over and looking at me, et cetera. I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026 what do I gain? I\u2019m tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: What was\u2026 yea, tell me more though about what was happening for you at the time. She\u2026 as you say, like this\u2026 there\u2019s this kind of sign that she wants to have sex. She wants to sleep with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: What was I thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yea, what was that\u2026 what was all happening for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: We went to the threshold to her bedroom. I sort of\u2026 it\u2019s going really nice. It\u2019s really nice but then where do you go, I guess? This isn\u2019t what I was feeling. I\u2019m just reflecting on it. I\u2019m like OK. I mean, where do you go?  Where do you go? I mean, I\u2019d be happy to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">true. I really enjoy undressing a woman and sort of getting at her sexuality a lot more than having sex, I think, although I\u2019m not sure about that. I just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, it is one element, though. That\u2019s the thing that it sounds like there\u2019s something that really feels important, enhancing, in some way good about turning on a woman, having her be aroused by you. (pause) But then you\u2019re sort of saying it\u2019s\u2026 but sex to you, like for everybody, is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">just that to you either.  There\u2019s the other elements that are in for you. One of them being like, \u201cWhat does the woman want from me? What is she expecting?\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s how I get the\u2026 that\u2019s what I get the impression from the lips and the, \u201cWhat is she looking for from me?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yea. Because I mean that\u2019s why probably younger girls are so attracted to me and maybe other people, too. But to me I can speak of the fact that I don\u2019t think they have clear structures about how they want things done. Whereas this person\u2026 (pause) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so weird. I mean, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">the pressure to perform and have sex with her. And then I don\u2019t want to.  (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">And then she sort of\u2026 she accepts that, I think. I mean my reading of it and then I just\u2026 I\u2019m stuck with like testosterone or sperm or whatever. I just want to have sex with her. I just want to. Actually that\u2019s not even true. The thing is I just want to manipulate her. I want to have her and (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">at 00:27:26) just under my physical control. The sex doesn\u2019t even matter. It\u2019s just I want her under my physical control and I couldn\u2019t do it. And it\u2019s frustrating because I feel impotent and powerless. I couldn\u2019t do it. But it\u2019s even with the younger women. I\u2019ve had those situations where they\u2019re kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">of in bed with me and I\u2019m supposed to do something. And I don\u2019t know what I want to do or what I\u2019m supposed to do whether I want to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563413\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">I don\u2019t know. (pause) It made me angry, though. I mean, because after tonight she sort of said like\u2026 she goes back to this thing. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I should\u2019ve made my intentions clear.\u201d What does that mean? Well, I mean, you probably expected to have sex with me or whatever. I mean, what bullshit is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: What did she\u2026 she said that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: She said that. She\u2019s saying like that she never intended to have sex with me and that she was establishing a boundary. And that I had run into that boundary and sort of\u2026 and she had outwilled me in some way.  I mean, there\u2019s an element of truth because after she sort of\u2026 or it\u2019s true because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">I\u2019m just in bed with her and I\u2019m lying there. And I can\u2019t go to sleep because there\u2019s like a naked and willing woman beside me. So I keep going for the pussy but she shuts it down. She just shuts it down. So it\u2019s that\u2026 but I mean, that\u2019s after she\u2026 we go through this whole courtship and she gets undressed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD2\">and she cleans all the wash right off her bed and stuff. It\u2019s just ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well, what was ridiculous?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: You probably want me to talk about the lingerie but it\u2019s ridiculous that she pretends that she didn\u2019t want to get fucked. That that\u2019s like not exactly what she wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: I mean, I probably sound like\u2026 well, what do you call those people, masochists? Just like she wanted it no matter what she said but I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: No, no.  I hear it, too. I think from what I could tell it sounds like she\u2026 at that moment maybe she didn\u2019t experience it as like, \u201cI want to have sex.\u201d More that, \u201cI want to be seduced or something like that. I want him\u2026\u201d She wanted you to kind of lead her down that next step. And she wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">going to be the initiator. She wanted\u2026 she looked to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: And then you\u2026 but what\u2019s interesting I think is that maybe that was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: I balked there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s where you balk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: But maybe that\u2019s where\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Well, I was going to say that\u2019s where the\u2026 that\u2019s where some other element comes into play for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yea, that\u2019s it. I mean, that\u2019s how I\u2026 I think you\u2019re right on when you say\u2026 and keep talking if you have more but when you say I need people to want me or admire me or something like that. And then beyond that I just\u2026 I expect to be carried or something. I don\u2019t really\u2026 (pause) That\u2019s since <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">I was a kid, I\u2019ve relied on that. I used to say in school if I just work hard for the first two months or something in school, I can just coast the rest of the time just on reputation. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s important. It\u2019s kind of like what you\u2019re sort of saying about the dealership in some way, too. You kind of\u2026 you get their respect. You feel like you\u2019ve gotten it and then something else\u2026 then it starts to feel like, \u201cI have to kind of keep going.\u201d  (pause) Well, what I\u2019m thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">just to go back to that the other thoughts that I do have is that I think one of it is when things start to change, what opens up is you\u2019ve gotten to this place with this woman. You feel up to that point like everything is kind of going in the right direction. But then\u2026 she then looks to you, \u201cMake <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C72\">this final move if you want it.\u201d But to turns to you. A couple things it sounds like it becomes. One is like, \u201cAm I going to be able to do it? How satisfying will I be in some way and to have some other way?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563413\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Am I going to be able to do it? Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: But that also sounds like it\u2019s more than just that, too. It\u2019s, \u201cWhat is she going to want from me? I want to be carried, too.\u201d  (pause) \u201cI want to be just\u2026 somehow I don\u2019t want this just to be a performance either. I want it to be something else.\u201d Not that that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just a performance <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">but you wanted something else, too. How did you put it? \u201cI want to be carried, too.\u201d Is that what you said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Carried. Yea, that is what I said. (pause) What really pissed me off, I guess, is\u2026 and really part of the evening which was really enjoyable. I mean, she\u2026 we\u2019re kind of getting there and then she suggested I get\u2026 I play some songs or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">I didn\u2019t bring a guitar because I came from work. But there was a guitar downstairs and there\u2019s this nice old lady that lives downstairs. And so she said, \u201cOh well, we got to go get the guitar. Why don\u2019t you come and play some songs?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, fuck it. You get it. Great.\u201d A little nicer but not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">that much. And I kind of changed my mind and I just decided to put my shirt on and go downstairs and so I played for two ladies down there and Tatiana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">And they\u2019re actually mother and daughter. The other one knew some folk songs so I had her play two songs and I played two songs and then I went upstairs. And she had me bring the guitar up. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to play more songs.\u201d She said, \u201cOh, you should bring the guitar up.\u201d The ladies are like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t hear. She said she wants you to play more songs.\u201d I said, \u201cOK, whatever.\u201d So I brought the guitar up. But to me, I mean, that was just a way of disguising the fact that we\u2019re going to have sex. Bring the guitar up or something like that. And from her landladies downstairs (inaudible at 0:35:14).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">But then at the end of the evening as I was leaving, or this morning I mean, I went to take the guitar because I wanted to bring it back to the ladies. She said, \u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t bring it down. I\u2019ll bring it. Don\u2019t bring down.\u201d I mean, these women had loved my singing. I sang beautiful songs to them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">But I wasn\u2019t permitted to say goodbye to them or give the guitar back. It\u2019s like some sort of show piece to be flaunted and then cut off from people. I said goodbye to them just to spite her. But not just to spite her, because I wanted to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">But it\u2019s obvious. Just like significant embarrassment and this woman\u2019s mind\u2026 I don\u2019t know about women in general. But this woman\u2019s mind about sex and wanting sex with a woman. It\u2019s just\u2026 and I\u2019m not going to take on the psychological baggage. I just\u2026 I\u2019m not going to assume the burden of someone else <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">wanting something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563413\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t like this person that much. She\u2019s got nice tits. It was fun hearing her talk. But then my downside is that I\u2026 and I\u2019m just\u2026 this doesn\u2019t make any coherent sense so I hope you can help me. But I get into bed with a person and I think I\u2019m in that ambivalent state and then the lights go <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">off and they\u2019re like half sleeping. I just want to have sex with them. I want to push it and push the threshold.  Or like not have sex. What I said, I just want to manipulate them. I want to be able to reach that physically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">THERAPIST: What do you think you wanted when you wanted to start watching the movie? What did you\u2026 were you aware of wanting anything from her? (pause) I guess in a way were you wanting her to seduce you or to show some interest in you? To be the one like to initiate it in any way? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">CLIENT: I mean, she had her hands all over me.  I just wanted a blow job, I guess. I mean, that\u2019s what I want. Like a blow job will set me off. But without that I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to ask for one either. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very often successful. But I mean, if I get a blow job, I mean, that establishes <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD1\">my sort of dominance or something. That I can just go from there. But I mean, also I suppose every woman who gets through a blow job is probably 100% wants sex. No, that\u2019s not true. But they definitely want sex, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Their part of foreplay, that kind of thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yea, plus in some ways like a blow job is more than vaginal sex. It\u2019s like an intimate act.  (pause) I was just quite cross. I mean, I didn\u2019t show it but to deal with this. I had my\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Well, it just sounds like it\u2019s dense with a lot of different feelings and meanings to you. That\u2019s certainly come to the fore in those kind of moments and you described it before, those critical moments where it\u2019s like, \u201cNow here\u2019s the next step.\u201d And it\u2019s bringing up a lot in terms of, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E31\">think, her desire, her will. I mean, those kind of, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for\u2026\u201d I was thinking in some way that it seemed to me like up until that point you were really feeling like a lot of the things were exactly what you wanted.  You\u2019re feeling like she wants\u2026 she\u2019s being seduced. She feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E32\">turned on. I was just thinking like in some way\u2026 and maybe I\u2019m wrong about this but in some way, what does she want outside of the performance piece of it as you put it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">CLIENT: That\u2026 I don\u2019t know if that was weighing on me. I know what you mean in terms of a relationship or I think that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Maybe that wasn\u2019t there as much as I\u2019m thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that was in my head. I could be wrong but it could be in the subconscious for one thing. Just part of a fear or ambivalence about it I see generally.  But what would she want? Yea. No, that was there. It\u2019s like, what would you want physically? And just the idea of sort of corralling <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">a woman, like sticking my dick in her is kind of\u2026 or this woman, I mean, is kind of a little awkward itself logistically or it just seems it\u2019s like an awkward transition. If we had stayed on the couch, that\u2019s one thing but there\u2019s not that much room there. It\u2019s just I guess there\u2019s a fear of rejection <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E92\">at that point, too. Because the last time I was with her, she shut me down in the same sort of way. So there\u2019s that.  I\u2019m just a guy with my dick hanging out and I need this woman to say, \u201cOK, you can shove it in me,\u201d even though I know she wants it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563413\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: But there\u2019s the thing, right, is that she kind of all but says it. And she\u2019s sort of saying to you, though, \u201cYou got to take it. You still got to take it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">CLIENT: Right, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: And then something stops you there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. It was weird, too. In the middle of the night I started thinking of her as like a truck, like I trapped her into like as in that limited space between sleep and something about my work on the job and it sort of melted. That she was like some vehicle. She was like a truck I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F11\">to sell or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: What are you\u2026 yes, what about the vehicle? You had to sell it to somebody or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: (chuckling) I just had to sell a truck and to achieve the truck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You had to what the truck? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: Achieve the truck. It was kind of a dream type of thing. It didn\u2019t make any\u2026 it doesn\u2019t fit into space. It\u2019s just a sensation to sell a truck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: To sell a truck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: I think I got in trouble, too, because I mean, I hung up on this guy. He told me that he wanted to put me on hold at my work. He\u2019s my supervisor and it\u2019s just very hard. I mean, you\u2019re brought in expecting one thing then it\u2019s like on Star Wars. It\u2019s this deal is getting worse all the time, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD1\">second movie. Things just keep changing and they keep you pepped up and I mean the deal gets worse and worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yea, what have you noticed? What\u2019s been\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: Well, I was brought into it expecting get on the showroom floor pretty quickly.  I even asked that and the guy said, \u201cOh yea, you\u2019ll get on three or four days. You\u2019ll need to be here a week of training.\u201d I got out in two weeks because they liked me so much but it wasn\u2019t what I expected. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201011\">then things like, I mean, I make a deal with one guy. He says, \u201cAll right, you give me a walk around on five of these cars and I\u2019ll never put another salesman on your deal again.\u201d So if I bring a customer in\u2026 this has happened to me. I call a customer, call a customer, call a customer. I call a hundred <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201012\">customers and one comes in after I call him three times and he asks for me, right? And then they pass that person onto somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: And so then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: And you\u2026 were you there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: I was there. It\u2019s just unacceptable because they don\u2019t trust me to make a sale yet because I haven\u2019t made one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s the reason they give? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think they even say it like that. The way they said it last time was, \u201cWell, this guy is Corvette certified. In order to sell a Corvette, you need to have the college.\u201d That was probably because he\u2019s not Corvette certified. I know because when I asked the guy, his eyes looked away. He\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D1\">lying so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Corvette certified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: I mean that\u2019s bullshit. So in order to get out of that making friends with the\u2026 my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss and I just said, \u201cI researched for this guy. I got this guy in. Why wasn\u2019t I talking to him?\u201d And he said, \u201cYou show me five cars with a good walk around I won\u2019t ever do that ever again or I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201111\">won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d He would never do that anyway but my boss would be the guy. And then I get in trouble the next day for some reason I don\u2019t understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20110-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20110-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563413\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">And my boss sort of rephrases the deal and sort of puts it as some sort of thing I didn\u2019t live up to like, \u201cI know Jim has spoken to you. I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re not the center of the dealership. And I know that Brian the other day he was talking to you. And he said that once you showed five cars and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201131\">walk around, you could approach customers. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d And I didn\u2019t answer. I just sort of curled my lips. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to answer for you. That\u2019s right.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t the deal. I mean, that wasn\u2019t what we agreed to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">THERAPIST: What does that mean, by the way, showing five cars?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: It means I walk around and show the features on the cars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: So like he gets an idea of, hey, how do you do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yea, the walk around. It\u2019s part of leading up to a demonstration ride. But I just I feel beset. I spent a lot of time on this. This morning I just felt\u2026 I cringed at the thought of I would have to work or saying that I don\u2019t, at least in the morning.  It\u2019s a showroom with a car and you\u2019re supposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B1\">to sell people cars. But it\u2019s the same ambivalence I get. I\u2019m supposed to\u2026 I\u2019m happy to talk to people and get to know them, get to know their needs. But I\u2019m supposed to sell this person a car and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Make the sale. Sell the truck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: I\u2019m happy to get to know them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: Sell the truck. Yea, there\u2019s something kind of gratifying about the idea of like the lead up to it. And then something else, something just changes when it\u2019s like you\u2019re actually going to put them in the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed. So by the way, what do they have you do if you\u2019re not allowed to sell?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: I just sit there. And I was allowed to approach people. I approached people for weeks but it takes they say $500 to bring each person into a dealership. So if you don\u2019t sell them, then a dealership is losing money in a sense.  They\u2019re losing prospective business then. So I bring through probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B1\">20 customers without selling a car. So after that they\u2026 it\u2019s a (inaudible at 0:48:14) system the same. But the way they said it was, \u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to approach customers,\u201d as if it had always been true. But I mean, it\u2019s just because I didn\u2019t sell the cars. If you perform, you can make <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B2\">your own rules. But if you don\u2019t, they don\u2019t let you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Oh, right. I see. That makes a lot more sense. Yea, if you\u2019re selling a car, what do they care about the rules? It\u2019s you\u2019re selling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: But if you\u2019re not, they need to make up something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: Then they\u2019ll make them up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: So that it works. In case this works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: Did they give you\u2026 how long does it take people to kind of get their bearings when they\u2019re selling cars?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: Well, they\u2019ve told me some guys took six months. They just sat around for six months and didn\u2019t talk to anybody. But I expect three months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: It takes some time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really beset though. I mean, things like talking to that\u2026 being left out, talking to those two neighbors downstairs. And when I go home I went home and there were three people sitting down to dinner.
