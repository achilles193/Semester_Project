And I am still upset about breaking up with Thomas, even though that is ridiculous. It was a month and a half ago, and I should get over it already. [0:01:03] I ended up spending a good chunk of Saturday afternoon over at his place because he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">feeling rotten and needed moral support. And his partner [0:01:19] was out of town. And I realized the extreme imbalance there when\u2026 and when I came back from Missouri and really, really needed moral support he was like no, can\u2019t do it. But anyway, that was tough, and I don\u2019t know. I shouldn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">gone over there. I should have said [inaudible] something, anything.

His birthday was Saturday, and Lucy, I think I\u2019ve mentioned, she\u2019s married to Thomas\u2019 former roommate. They were roommates right up until October when Lucy and Pete got married.

[0:03:00] I realize my social circle is ridiculously incestuous. I\u2019m sorry. It sounds like the plot to Days of Our Lives or something. But anyway, Lucy and I are meeting up on Saturday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">to bake Thomas cake for his birthday because I am bad at boundaries apparently. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I\u2026 what I think about is why you seem so keen on chastising yourself for still having feelings for Thoma, and being upset about things ending with him and other things. [0:06:06] (pause) I can\u2019t tell whether (pause) I don\u2019t know. I mean I\u2019m wondering, is it how you\u2019re dealing with the kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">of vulnerability that goes with having feelings for somebody, is it that there\u2019s something a bit fun, in a way, about feeling\u2026 or exciting about feeling kind of (pause) I don\u2019t know, critical of yourself in that way, is it that\u2026 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And consciously, at least, it\u2019s feeling stupid for having put myself in the position where I let myself be so vulnerable to someone who made it very clear from very early on that he did not, and would never, love me. [0:08:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: He did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You never mentioned that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: We had a conversation in August about the fact that he does not use the word love except in\u2026 for people he thinks he might want to [inaudible] having this conversation about whether [inaudible] marriage is a tool of oppression and how [ph] children who are genetically [inaudible] And also, more <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">than once, when I was like well, where do I stand with you, how do you feel about me, here are the things I feel about you, and his response in every case boiled down to having me over was good for him because my presence encouraged him to eat better and clean up his apartment and make sure he had clean <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">clothes and the sex was good. [0:09:10] And those aren\u2019t really feelings. And I\u2019m happy to be good for the people I date and care about.

[0:10:11] That\u2019s the key part of why I\u2019m so angry at myself over how things happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I mean you have mentioned him not being more expressive of feelings towards you and your asking him for that, but I don\u2019t\u2026 yeah (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: My friend Lo put it this way. She said that Dave [inaudible] is more expressive about his feelings towards varieties of cheese than Thomas is about his feelings towards me, which is unfortunately true. [0:11:04] And granted, Dave is probably more expressive about cheese than the average human. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">He\u2019s several sentences [ph] above the average\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I see, when it comes to\u2026 in the [inaudible] expressiveness about cheese category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah, good to mention.

[0:12:04] Well (pause) All right, so I\u2026 his\u2026 I think\u2026 what? [0:13:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Your stuttering is just like you just have no idea what to do with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Oh, no, no. I was still probably a little fuzzy from being sick, and I\u2019m sort of trying to think how of to explain something. But I actually, surprisingly, feel it\u2019s like all of a sudden a little clearer, maybe, what\u2019s going on, which is I think you use the self-criticism and self-flagellation <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">to protect you from feeling closer and actually, in a way, kind of more vulnerable with Tracy. I mean it absolutely is a problem he is not more expressive about his feelings for you, and hasn\u2019t been. Absolutely. But it seems to me you equate that with his not having feelings for you or not demonstrating <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">those in other ways. [0:14:22] I mean whatever he says about it, it seems evident that there are people he loves and that, who knows, I sort of have the impression, maybe I\u2019m wrong about this, that there are ways in which you guys have been quite close, actually, and that it\u2019s pretty clear that he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200493\">incredibly uncomfortable or awkward or anxious or something, [inaudible] something (laughter) about being explicit about any of that. [0:15:11] But you sort of do the other thing, which is though you provide some evidence of knowing better, I think, otherwise I have no [inaudible] know that there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200494\">things he feels, though he won\u2019t say them. And you turn it into being sort of, as you often do as we know, about your own stupidity. I mean if you were saying look, I think it\u2019s not good for me to be involved with somebody who\u2019s not more up front about his feelings because it makes me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It turns me into an anxious neurotic mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Something like that, yeah. Okay, I get it. But to say well I\u2019m stupid for being with somebody who said he doesn\u2019t get into love at all. [0:16:12] The tenor of which I think I heard much more as being like he was\u2026 well no, in fact is\u2026 was what you said, was not just implication, that he said <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">he wasn\u2019t going to love you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Which is kind of bullshit. I mean I think he may never say it, but I mean from what you\u2026 again, maybe I don\u2019t have a sense of him at all, but from the things you\u2019ve described about him, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s feeling love or not, but he\u2019s capable of being close and to kind of enjoy things about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">that with you, loathe though he clearly is to admit it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562014\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: If you say so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You know what I mean? It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a big difference between it turns me into an anxious and neurotic mess when somebody doesn\u2019t say it because then all my demons get going and whatever, or self-doubt, fine, and well he said he was never going to feel that way and that just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">makes me an idiot. [0:17:06] The second one\u2026 in the second one it seems to me as though you\u2019re operating in a way where you would rather focus on and think about your own stupidity than the closeness you feel to be there between you. (pause) And while I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: It might just prove the point you\u2019re trying to make, but I don\u2019t know, I feel like there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of emotional closeness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, I\u2019m\u2026 yeah, well it\u2019s your\u2026 I mean you made\u2026 this is a hard thing for me to get a clear sense of. [0:18:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right. So I don\u2019t know, it just (pause) so my laundry list is things that made me feel unliked and unappreciated in that relationship. I mean there was a lot, actually. But the fact that I had to do all of the scheduling and planning of our dates, or I would suggest a day to meet up that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">like a week and a half, two weeks into the future, and he would say no, I\u2019m overscheduled, I\u2019m too busy, I need time to myself, and would suggest a date that was four, five weeks in the future. And then I would watch his calendar fill up with appointments with other women, which I have no idea what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">the nature of those relationships are. [0:19:09] I don\u2019t know any of the people he was meeting. For all I know it could\u2019ve been a psychologist or a lawyer or a business contact or whatever. But it was still like the fact that he wasn\u2019t forthright with me about what was going on, saying he needed time <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B3\">to himself and then making appointments with other people. I don\u2019t usually get jealous in relationships. That\u2019s actually remarkably rare for me. I\u2019m not going to say something so asinine as I don\u2019t feel jealousy, but it\u2019s it is unusual and it\u2019s generally a red flag for me that there\u2019s something going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B4\">wrong. Or the fact that we would be having a conversation about whatever and he would just not engage with what I was saying. I would say something and then he would say something completely unrelated about a completely different topic and\u2026 with no verbal segue or indication that he was thinking of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B5\">something else. [0:20:12] It was very odd and\u2026 but to some extent that\u2019s something he does with everyone. He\u2019s just bad at conversational back and forth. But it certainly contributed to the feeling that he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to things that were important to me. And the fact that in eight months <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B6\">he never asked me how are you, how was your day, how are you doing. Nothing. And that\u2019s not hyperbolated; it started\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: No, I believe you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: \u2026feeling weird after the first two weeks of chatting online, where almost everyone who I chat with frequently online the first thing we do when we start talking is ask how are you, spend a few minutes\u2026 I\u2019m feeling down, oh, I\u2019ve had a good day, oh, work is crazy, my boss is an asshole, whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">And it\u2019s not long; it\u2019s only a few lines, but\u2026 and he never did. And so I started paying attention, and he never once asked how are you, either in person or online. That was really weird. [0:21:12] And of course his response to me telling him that I love him and care about him and he matters to me and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">the relationship is important to me, his response was basically you\u2019re good in bed, which was kind of insulting actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562014\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: I mean there is a time and place to tell someone you\u2019re having sex with that you enjoy having sex with them, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: At times it can be really nice to hear; that was not one of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: But yeah, it felt really clear to me that I was not a priority for him. And again, it\u2019s not the sort of relationship where I thought it might lead to things like comingling finances or genetic material, but\u2026 and I certainly never expect to be anyone\u2019s first priority or even top five for casual <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">relationships. I hate phrasing things primary, secondary, tertiary. It\u2019s just horrible language. But I know a lot of polyamorous people in Providence like to use\u2026 that\u2019s really gross to me. But there is a difference between relationships that are long term partnerships and ones that aren\u2019t. But I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B2\">expected to be on the priority list somewhere, right, like maybe down around 10 or 12, but I\u2019m expected to be on there somewhere. And it felt like I wasn\u2019t at all. [0:23:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and that is all stuff that you have made clear before, and I\u2019d take the point of\u2026 and it\u2019s unclear to me whether\u2026 I mean who\u2019s to say\u2026 now I\u2019d have more the feeling like for you that conveyed he didn\u2019t care whereas I guess there are other times where it was more like it\u2019s clearly his <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">awkwardness, anxiety, inhibition, something about expressing what he feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t know where the truth lies between those two, probably some combination, but it is easier for me to frame it as he never cared and I\u2019m an idiot for thinking he could as opposed to he has serious problems and\u2026 that I wasn\u2019t able to surmount.

I didn\u2019t break up with him because he\u2019s depressed. That\u2019s not even remotely what I think happened. I broke up with him because I feel like I need and deserve to have partners who show an interest in my life and ask how I\u2019m doing and want to see me more often than once <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">every five weeks. That was just untenable, and it was making me crazy.

[0:32:19] And my friend Tristan asked me to write a post about a poet or poem that I like. And I went long, long past the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">deadline. It was supposed to go up December 27 but it didn\u2019t. But I\u2019ve been trying to catch up. There are a couple of posts from that meeting [ph] that I\u2019ve been meaning to write. But so yesterday I sat down after work to start to write this and then I got blocked, like mild writer\u2019s block, and I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">to surf Facebook. And my friend Matilda had posted a link to an old post on somebody\u2019s blog from 2010 where Lucy wrote about the poet Sappho, and then gave her own translations of 700 lines of ancient Greek. And it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, inferiority complex because I can\u2019t\u2026 I know my reviews are not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200873\">as good to read as other reviewers, and Lucy is particularly gifted reviewing media, especially poetry. [0:33:22] And poetry is hard to write about. And I don\u2019t speak four different dialects of ancient Greek. She knows Aeolic and Attic and two others. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a classic scholar. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200874\">even know what types of Greek she knows. I certainly can\u2019t translate Sappho at all, which\u2026 so then, I don\u2019t know.

What matters is that you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">translate the ancient Greek not that you read [ph] Sappho or inspired or whatever it is that (pause) Yeah, I\u2026 for a time I [inaudible] I mean I think it\u2019s a little more complicated with [inaudible] maybe [inaudible] there\u2019s a person you have feelings about in the first place, like Tracy or Sappho, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">then there\u2019s another person like me or Sonya in a relationship you feel inadequate and as though the whole your having feelings in the first place and all of that gets kind of disqualified in relation to your talking to me feeling like an idiot about how you feel about Tracy, and similarly I think with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D3\">Sappho because of Sonya. [0:37:55] That it makes you feel so inadequate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: And so ashamed of how you feel, having those feelings of who you are probably.
