(pause) (sigh) I don\u2019t know what to start with. I\u2019m going to Missouri next weekend; it\u2019s a terrible decision, but my family\u2019s on my case. My youngest sister is graduating from grad school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I don\u2019t want to go; I have too much stuff going on. But a lot of the stuff going on is stuff that I have very carefully not told my family about, so as far as they know like when we talk on the phone, they\u2019re like \u201cSo what\u2019s new in your life?\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cNothing; go to work; come home; sleep; I\u2019m bored.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">So they\u2019re like \u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything, why can\u2019t you come?\u201d [0:01:03] (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">But given the way my mom flipped out when I told her I was taking lessons, like, I can\u2019t tell them anything. And also, they\u2019re now making the argument that they wanted to come to my grad school graduation, and I told them no, which is not at all how I remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">How I remember it is, you know, Mom and Dad, over the course of many months, every time we talked about my graduation, would make noises about how it\u2019s going to be so hard, because they can\u2019t drive from Missouri to [] overnight, because Krista\u2019s graduation was the day before mine. And \u201cyou know how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">your dad doesn\u2019t like airports, and he hasn\u2019t flown since 9\/11.\u201d That\u2019s a lie, by the way. He absolutely has flown for work, and for professional obligations, and to go to a fucking conference in Key West. (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">\u201cBut it\u2019s too far to drive in one night, and you know, we can\u2019t ask your dad to pull an all-nighter, and you know how he is about airports, and you know he can\u2019t fly and blah, blah, blah.\u201d And so after like three months of this, I said, \u201cWell, you know, graduations aren\u2019t as important to me as they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">are to Krista. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to go, because commencement addresses are boring. Ahhh whatever. [0:02:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">But now they\u2019re saying I forbade them to come. When I only conceded after they had hounded me for like three months about how terrible it was going to be if I asked them to come. (sigh) So now I\u2019m questioning myself, did I misunderstand? Were they just griping about the travel because they like to gripe, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">was that not? Then hinting that they didn\u2019t want to come? (sigh) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I mean of course I didn\u2019t tell them either that my feelings were deeply hurt that they went to Krista\u2019s graduation and not mine. (pause) Because, you know, what good would it do? [0:03:33] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to stomach how awful it can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t want to go on this trip; it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day weekend; it\u2019s going to be a pain in the ass. [0:04:40] (sneeze)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Bless you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Like I have a group of friends here who all have conflicted feelings about Mother\u2019s Day, and so we celebrate Motherless Children\u2019s Day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been doing that for a couple of years, and I\u2019m going to miss it this year because of this stupid graduation trip, and it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Dave is going with me at least, because the last time me going by myself was catastrophically bad. (pause) [0:05:22]-[0:06:22] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s so hugely frustrating that I have no idea what my parents are thinking, because like my dad makes a very big deal about how he always speaks his mind, and he doesn\u2019t keep secrets, and he very forthright. Except those are all fucking lies. He plays head games, and he tells people lies <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">about how he\u2019s feeling, and then he gets upset when they don\u2019t understand like what\u2019s going on in his head.

Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">they did want to come to my graduation; maybe they did think I told them not to come. And then I\u2019ll feel like an asshole. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:08:01), one is (pause) I don\u2019t know for sure, not having been there, but my strong suspicion is that you are (pause) sort of bending what you are pretty sure has been the case. (pause) In a way that like letting them off the hook, and sort of felt punitive at the same time. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Probably if that\u2019s true, because I\u2019m thinking it may be pretty hard to tolerate just how fucking awful they can be. And yet, (pause) all I have is like (chuckle) (inaudible at 0:09:11) just don\u2019t fucking go. You know, probably even if (inaudible at 0:09:17), it\u2019s probably better to pay not to go, than <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">to go. (laughter) It all of a sudden came up for work. And even if they think it\u2019s a lie; feel it\u2019s a lie; know it\u2019s a lie, who cares? Like that\u2019s the currency anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: No one\u2019s getting anywhere near the truth, so what the hell?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I guess I might (laughter) my hesitation in saying is not a hesitation thinking it\u2019s probably right; I think it probably is right. (pause) It\u2019s more like I\u2019m not quite sure what role that puts me in, or I\u2019ll have to think about that. But that is actually (chuckle) what I think. [0:10:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">You come from every visit with them during which I\u2019ve known you, feeling horrible, horrible, horrible, to the extent that like at least it\u2019s been my impression, you\u2019ve kind of only been able to talk about bits and pieces of it. But it\u2019s been hard to get a full extent of the horror of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">You usually feel pretty miserable the few days before you go, as you kind of get closer to feeling and knowing what it\u2019s going to be like. (pause) I haven\u2019t \u2013 there may be something redeeming, but I haven\u2019t heard that yet, that comes from your visits with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I think that temporarily this relieves my guilt of her not being a good enough daughter.

(pause) [0:14:07] (pause) In other news, my friend Katie e-mailed me this morning in a complete panic, because Brian\u2019s going to be at [the conference] (ph) this weekend.

[] is this big three-day long festival.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: [The conference] (ph) the Harvard thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. So a lot of people are coming in from out of town; I\u2019m going for the first time since like 2006, just because [the conference] was never my thing; I never really enjoyed it even when I was a student.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: So once I graduated, there\u2019s no reason to go. But this year there\u2019s enough people who I haven\u2019t seen, and who live far enough away, that I\u2019m going and will get to see them. So Katie\u2019s in a complete panic about Brian coming to [the conference)].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Katie\u2019s (been the one you\u2019re with?)

Katie is best friends with Lori, who is one of my close friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, Lori is Lo\u2019s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yes. And Katie and I have never gotten along; it\u2019s always been the oil and water with us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Okay. (inaudible at 0:15:33).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: But for Lo\u2019s sake, we have been making an effort to like be civil to each other, and also as we\u2019ve gotten older, we\u2019ve both mellowed out a little bit. It\u2019s not been nearly as oil and water; it\u2019s more like mold and \u2013 but (chuckle) and Katie has started participating in like science fiction <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">fandom and places where I\u2019ve participated in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">And so like it\u2019s just \u2013 for the sake of everyone, it\u2019s best if we learn to get along. So we\u2019ve been talking a little bit on IM. Katie was one of the first people that Stacey, Brian\u2019s girlfriend, called after it happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Katie\u2019s close with Stacey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh) But Stacey didn\u2019t really have any friends of her own, so Katie was the only person she could think of to call, and wouldn\u2019t immediately take Brian\u2019s side. [0:16:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: So, Katie also used to date Ashley; Katie also used to date another one of my ex\u2019s. It\u2019s a social circle that was incestuous. But anyway, so Katie is super upset, and sent an all caps like e-mail full of feelings. And I looked at it, and I was just like, you know, if this had happened last year; <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">if I ever planned on going to \u2013 if I had gone to (Vanessa) (ph) last year, I would have been very upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">But I just have no emotional energy left between my family, and Cricket, and her drama, and just \u2013 and still feeling bad about Ashley, even though it\u2019s been five months now, and I really should just get over it. I just \u2013 (pause) think about the thought of running into her, often just \u2013 man, I cannot <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">tell you \u2013 bring myself to feel any kind of fear or anxiety, which on one hand, I\u2019m not feeling fear or anxiety, but on the other hand, like when I\u2019m at a level, I\u2019m a little bit worried that I don\u2019t feel anything about this at all.

I keep telling myself, it\u2019s only 36 hours, but I don\u2019t know. Last time it was less than that; last time it wasn\u2019t even a full 24 hours, and I was a wreck for weeks afterwards. I have so much work to do on the book, and with the church school, and commitments I\u2019ve made.

Like I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t afford to spend like a week completely unable to do anything, except drive myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">to work, and then like I just \u2013 I can\u2019t.

[0:21:07] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: (And I imagine,) (ph) you probably have more control over how they\u2019re making you miserable if you didn\u2019t go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: You know, (inaudible at 0:22:00). And, you know, pretty e-mails if you want to; and you don\u2019t have to read all of them. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: I\u2019m still angry about (pause) (sigh) when my grandmother died, before I was in grad school, and I went down for the funeral. And at the time, I had this part-time gig doing game reviews for extra money to supplement my grad student stipend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: I think you mentioned it to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, so you know, I went to her funeral, and my grandmother and I were never close; I wasn\u2019t even going to go to the funeral, except that I knew the rest of the family would be dicks to my mother, and she needed someone there she could count on. [0:23:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">And I was right; everyone in the family, including my father and my sisters were giant dicks to my mother, and I was the only one who was thinking about her feelings at all. (sigh) But anyway, I went, and I had a ton of work to do for school, and I also had some reviews that were due for site I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">freelancing for. So whenever there was downtime, I had my laptop out, and my dad came over, and he was like, \u201cYou aren\u2019t working; you\u2019re playing a game.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">So I explained to him that I have this job; I play games, then I write reviews, and I have a deadline, and I\u2019m going to get paid like $200 for this review. But I can\u2019t review the game until I play it. And he just sat there making fun of me, saying that my head was in the clouds, and I lived in a dream <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">world, and I didn\u2019t understand how the real world works, or how to make money. And don\u2019t I understand that this is not how you make money? Like my head is in the clouds. \u201cOh God, why me? Why is my child so flighty?\u201d I was like, \u201cI am hustling to make money to supplement my stipend. I understand very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">well how to make money. In fact, I\u2019ve figured out how to make money doing something that is relatively enjoyable for me.\u201d [0:24:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562374\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">But he just went on and on about how I was so stupid and didn\u2019t understand how the world worked. It was just \u2013 (sigh). There was another visit; I can\u2019t remember when, or what the circumstances were, but I was in Missouri, and staying with Krista, and Jane was at school, and I can\u2019t remember if she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">at Missouri State, or if she\u2019d already gone to Southern Mississippi at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: [How would this be cleared?] (ph) like \u201cHe was being crazy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes.

But I think both are true, I mean (inaudible at 0:25:05) crazy. You\u2019re in grad school for engineering. By the way, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m just not clicking to make money. You came down to the funeral, which you didn\u2019t have to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: But not that my dad cared about the funeral; that was \u2013 he also told my mother, \u201cOh don\u2019t cry, you know, your mother always was mean to you on the phone, and made you miserable and now you never have to talk to her again.\u201d Which (sigh), while true, my grandmother was horrible person, and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">was abusive to my mother, and every time they talked on the phone, my mom would get off the phone and cry for hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">And she\u2019s probably better off without Granny in her life, but not the thing to say at a funeral; not the thing to say out loud forever, except in, you know, maybe the privacy of a therapist\u2019s office or a confessional booth. But like, (sigh) there are plenty of true things (chuckle) that don\u2019t need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">be said out loud. [0:26:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">No, he\u2019s just (pause) yeah.
