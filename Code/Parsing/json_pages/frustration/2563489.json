Yeah, good. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: So just got home. (pause) Anyway so I have a cup of tea. Yeah, [I don t know] (ph). It s one of those things where I just get home from work and there s that feeling of just (pause) relief. So in a way, I feel like I ve done a good thing and I ve sort of got my life back. [0:01:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: As opposed to what you yeah, as opposed to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Well, as opposed to in the morning, waking up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So wake up at 3:30 even though the alarm s supposed to go off at 5:00 and I can t get back to sleep and there s that feeling of it s like, all right. (pause) It s going to be a good feeling when you are done with work. You just got to get up. You got to get going. And it s going to be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: And then you d kind of get your life back at the end of the day? [0:01:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that s it. It s like, you re just of (ph) well so today, I mean, I m teaching I m teaching the five kingdoms, which is mind numbing. I mean, it s (chuckles) it s the least interesting part of biology, for me. So <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It s the what is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: The least interesting part of biology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: But what did you call it? The five kingdoms? [0:02:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: The five kingdoms. Oh, yeah. So Plantae, Animalia, Ubacteria (sp?), Protista, Fungi, and describing the differences between them. (pause) And it s very language intensive, and it s primarily Greek. So biology is a mix of Latin and Greek, but this particular area is primarily Greek roots, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">means that Spanish speakers don t have any intuition about the words. So it s especially taxing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">And also, it seems (pause) I don t know I guess I mean, they need to learn it. I mean, that s the thing, right? I always have to remind myself kids I have the advantage of going through it thinking well, I mean, I know what this is about and I m choosing not to care about it. But they need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">have that choice. They need to (laughing) they need to they need to learn it first and then decide whether they want to keep it in their brain or not. I keep having to tell myself, okay, they re 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 years old, and so I m the one who has to present this stuff possibly for the very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">first time to them. [0:04:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Even though in my mind, I m certainly not excited about it. But I have to rev myself up. Anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. What is it what is that it just occurred to me that that s an interesting way to put it, like you have to you (inaudible at 0:04:27) they or they need to have they need to learn it first and then they can have the choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: But it s almost like you have to you re sort of in the position of having to of (inaudible at 0:04:42) learn it, but they have to you re in the position of making them learn it before they get to yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: That s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And how is that how is that for in that position, though, to be the one doing that the enforcer? I don t know if you d characterize it that way, but something to that effect. The guy that s [0:05:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563489\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well (pause) today, fortunately, there weren t any real behavior issues. So that was good. I mean, if there were issues with kids just being incredibly boisterous and (inaudible at 0:05:36) and just annoying, then that would ve been (inaudible). But today, they seemed to be (audio gap) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">along. And so it made (pause) it made the whole topic less stressful for me because I would have to deal with their bad behavior and my, sort of, disinterest in the topic. Because if you have to sort of rev yourself up to act excited and then they re not into school that day, not just and not just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">in my class, but any class they re just sort of not doing school that day, then it s sort of like, ow, geez, what s the point? [0:06:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: So and one thing when I got this morning, there was a feeling so anyway, yesterday (inaudible at 0:06:27). And last week, Sebastian and I like Sebastian a lot. He s very funny he I brought I had some I had a bag of stick pretzels. And so he asked if he could have some, so I gave <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">him a (audio gap). Then he saw the honey that I put in yogurt, and he goes, Oh, mister, can I put honey on the pretzels? And I said, Yeah, sure. So he poured honey on the pretzels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">And he said, Oh, mister, this is (audio gap). Right? And I said, Really? So he handed me one and I went, That s pretty damn good. So then I m at Trader Joe s yesterday and in the (audio gap) pretzels. And I m like, Sebastian! So I bought this bag of honey pretzels. So anyway [0:07:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Not honey mustard pretzels, but honey pretzels?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Honey. Honey, yeah. Just honey. Sweet or slightly sweat. I mean, not as sweat as if you pour honey on them like he did, which is (inaudible 0:07:30). So I bought these bag of pretzels, right? So then but they re jumbo. They re like four inches long and thick diameter, like it s like half <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">of a pencil. That s how big they are. So he comes in after school, as he always does. And I hand him some and I said, Just taste just taste those, Sebastian. So he tasted them, and he goes, Oh, mister. (laughter) [0:07:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">Anyway, so this morning when I m lying I this morning when I was (inaudible) morning and I m tired even though I went to bed at 8 o clock last night, I thought, Okay. I m just going to come in, and he will be excited about the honey pretzels. And it matters because I genuinely like Sebastian. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">it s like it s funny how that is. There can be so many kids who are just taxing, taxing, taxing, but that one kid who I genuinely (audio gap) it s like, okay. That makes me happy. (pause) Anyway, so he was very impressed by the honey pretzels. And then he said, What if we put honey on the honey pretzels? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">And I said, Sure. (laughter) That was over the top, and he thought that was the best (crosstalk). [0:08:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No, but I hear it, too. It s like in some way, there s a it s such a it s such a it s such a difference than the kind of potential for antagonistic not a drag down, throw down fight kind of way, but some antagonism about you being the guy that s got to make them do the work <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">that they don t want to do (crosstalk) kind of ease and kind of like, Hey, we can we can agree on this one or something. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563489\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I also and Sebastian s never a problem, right? I mean, she s always entertaining. He always, for the most part, does his work. He has his off days. But (pause) it s like, and [I don t know] (ph). This was two months ago, I guess. Because I expect a lot of him, and also I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">him better, when (inaudible 0:09:55), I find it annoying. And I find it less annoying lately because he is usually on the ball. And if he s not, it s sort of like, well, I ll just treat him like another student. It s like, well, you re not doing your work, so I mean, you just don t get that many points. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">So that s the way it is. [0:10:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: But so two months ago, I m sort of irritated with him and I have to tell him, in class, that he has to work. So he stops everything. He s very dramatic. He said, Mister  He goes, You never see the good in me. You only see the bad. He goes, You know how many good things I do? (laughing) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">And I couldn t help but smile. I said, Really, Sebastian? He goes, Yes. He goes, Your class would be a disaster if it wasn t for me. And I said, Really? And he goes, Yes. (inaudible at 0:10:54) he s going on about all the good things I do, but I don t see that. I only see the bad things. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">of course, other kids were laughing because he s sort of getting all this attention for being amusing, which he is. Anyway, You only see the bad things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That s so interesting. His name s Sebastian. (chuckles) [0:11:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: And he s Sebastian. Exactly. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: So, I mean, it just there s something about, though going along with what we ve been saying, we ve been talking about these, if you can only see the good part, you only see the bad parts. And something about how we ve been talking about like Sebastian talking about his own self these <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">various states of his own, like what (inaudible 0:11:42) side of him, but he feels like he s got other side other sides to him. He s got honey, too. He s not just got the stick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: (laughing) Something about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: So then I got this other kid who, he s funny because he s his name s Enrique and he is very stylish. He reminds me a lot of my friend Derek, in high school, in terms of how he looks. The Spanish version of Derek instead of an Irish version of Derek. And very cool, stylish hair. He s a soccer <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">player, so he s got that sort of Spanish soccer player (audio gap). And he s very quiet, but very self-assured, very conscientious, very respectful. And he s very popular and cool and people like him. But he kind of sticks to himself, and he does all the work and he really tries. [0:12:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">(pause) So he, just through sheer hard work and sort of intention to do well, he ends up having a B+ or an Ain class, which is a big deal, because his English is like a level two as opposed to a level three. So English is definitely more difficult for him than other kids, but he works really hard. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">So and so I tend to cut him a slack a little bit, and in the sense that I don t know. If you like a kid, if they have their phone out, you don t bust them the first time. You sort of are little gentler about it. Because in his case, he usually doesn t. So you sort of assume since he doesn t always <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">try to get the phone out, if he does have it out, it might be for a good reason, like he is legitimately actually checking the time. Whereas other kids, it s just this constant battle. So it s little things like that. [0:13:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563489\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">Anyway, so after class last week, he s leaving he s always sort of the last to leave. And so he s leaving. He said, Mister  He said, I want to be a teacher someday. I want to be a teacher like you. And (laughing) I looked at him and I said, That s very nice, Enrique. You re going to need a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">of patience. (laughing) And he laughed. But how interesting. I didn t see that coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 0:14:36) for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Well (pause) it made me happy because I thought, at least one student (audio gap) think I m a pain in (audio gap). (inaudible at 0:14:50).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Oh, uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. [0:14:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: In the sense that I m consistent. I m always there. I try to always be the same. I try to be amusing. I try to be real. (pause) Anyway <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: And I make a point of, when kids are doing well in class, on their way out, I ll tell them, (inaudible 0:15:20) Good work today. So with Enrique, I think most days, (inaudible) going out, as I do with other kids, it s like, Hey, nice job. (pause) Anyway, so there s this other kid. His name <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">is Joe and he s I ve probably described him before. He s the kid who s from Honduras. Raised by his grandparents, and then he was involved in with a murder in Honduras.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: So then his grandparents said that he was going to go get to visit his parents in Waltham ticket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:16:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: So anyway, so he s had difficulties, clearly, emotionally, not to mention the fact that he came here with very little English. And he always walks into class late and he often is really tired. And he s often got his headphones, which I have to tell him to put them away. And he ll usually start <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">class late and he ll try to do the (inaudible at 0:16:40). So he ll start class, the first ten minutes or so. And then, he just, for some reason, just (pause) puts his head his head goes. And he s sort of he s out. [0:16:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">Well, so Enrique, now, has moved seats. And somehow I feel like he I think Enrique did this on his own. I m not sure why, exactly. But Enrique used to sit toward the front. And now Enrique sits in the very back with Joe. But Enrique, he will sometimes raise his hand and point to him, and I ll come <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">back and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Joe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: He ll so Enrique will point to Joe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. Right (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: And so and I ll go back there. And Enrique, in an amused not irreverent way, but just sort of an older brother sort of way, even though they re the same age, Enrique will want me to wake Joe up. And then Joe will wake up. And then Enrique, in Spanish, will just sort of bust his balls, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">then Enrique will stay (audio gap) Joe will stay awake. And then Joe Enrique will help Joe with his classwork. [0:18:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">And Enrique will often, I can tell he really sort of busts Joe, and Joe kind of has to defend himself. So he sort of looks to me like, How can how can you let Enrique say this stuff to me? Enrique will say to Joe, he goes, You re lazy. And Joe will look to me like, That s not a nice thing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">say. And I sort of shrug my shoulders, and Enrique says, It s true. So all the sudden, Enrique has taken it upon himself to just be like the strong arm of the law, like in a street sense I can t do it in the way that Enrique can do it, because he s a peer. He s kind of just basically saying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">Joe, You got to shape up, brother. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563489\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: And so it s like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like he took an interest in going all the way back there to be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: That s it.

It s just sort of like it s sort of like just calling a spade a spade. Like, I m trying to show interest in you. I m (audio gap) you and you re not doing anything, so there s only so much a person can do. And it s very interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">watching that dynamic, because Enrique doesn t I mean, he does just as much work as he has always done, which is everything. But in addition to that, he s taken upon himself to keep Joe awake.

And it has this dramatically <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">different effect than if you did it, right? Is that what you re <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Oh, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: And it s also because Enrique is just this really cool guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.

(pause) On Friday, the math class (pause) so biology, I knew what I was doing and that s fine.

[0:22:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">But on Friday, with math, I was just it was just a bad class. It was just a bad class. I think it was the first bad class that I really have every really done, in terms of I wanted to show a video. I couldn t find the video. I wanted to teach this thing, but it was totally off target. And it was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">disjointed. It was just the kids were surprisingly okay with it. And maybe it was because it was Friday, they were sort of happy not to have to do too much. Because I was up there trying to find the video and trying to find the thing I wanted to show them, and the minutes were passing. And I was doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF2\">this and I was doing that, and we re kind of jumping form topic to topic.

So you guys showed up today, and I didn t. My bad. (laughing) I said, I didn t do my homework. This was a bad class and it s on me. And I ll do better on Monday. And I said, Have a good weekend. (chuckles) Anyway, and so on Monday <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\"> or today class started, and I m like, All right. So we re shifting gear. And I said, I apologize again for Friday. I know that was sort of a waste of time. And I feel like somehow, that got more kids on my side than usual. I mean, (inaudible) they are a very chatty class. And somehow I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C12\">like they sort of respected a teaching just sort of saying, Yeah, my bad. I screwed up. That was a disaster. And it s totally on me.

Yeah, but that you just came out and kind of acknowledged something to them, sort of huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, and also maybe it highlighted, too, yeah, teachers have to prepare. And if they don t (audio gap) (laughing) you know? So maybe it highlighted it s like, Oh yeah. He really does have to prepare. And class usually is really good and that day wasn t, and clearly, he didn t prepare. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">oh, when class does go well, it means he actually has to prepare for it. Maybe that was I didn t make that clear, but maybe that was the inference maybe that was the implication. [0:25:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. And I suppose I suppose kind of the implicit message, too, is like, Hey, we all got to work at (inaudible at 25:24).

It s sort of like it also feels like, well it also feels like, well, if work is work and my home life is my real (audio gap) then if my real life happens to be yesterday when I m not working and I m with Barbara and it was taxing and stressful, then it s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">oh, then my (inaudible at 0:27:30) self is sort of unpleasant. So then work becomes a distraction. [0:27:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: I wouldn t have thought that this morning, waking up. But after the fact school s amusing. It goes along. It s predictable enough. At least I know what I m teaching. I know I know what we re going to do in class. I know what they re going to do. Whereas with Barbara, (laughing) it s not like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

And unpredictable, for [certain. For certain.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: So then anyway, so in the morning, I m not sure she said something that I found irritating. And then we go to Trader Joe s to do our normal, weekly shop. And on the way back, we were going to go to the gym, but then it was sunny out. And we re like, maybe even though we want to work out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">hard, maybe we can just take a walk and [we ll get] (ph) some sunshine. [0:28:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">So I said, Well, walk around the ponds twice, but if we do, we have to do it vigorously. And she said, Yeah. That s a good idea. So we parked and then she had to pee, but the Port-A-Potty was nasty, so she wouldn t pee in it, which meant she had to walk three and a half miles having to pee, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">couldn t. So I was regaling her with all of my new linguistics knowledge for three and a half miles, partly because I just felt like saying it and partly because I felt like distracting her from having to pee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: So (laughing) I m basically I m recounting two thirds of a college linguistics course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Really? Huh. [0:29:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, (inaudible) University of New Mexico has this linguistics course through iTunes, so I m watching that taking that. So I was I basically started from the very beginning and taught her linguistics over the course of three and a half miles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: What s the what s the linguistics class on? Is it like a general...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, it s iTunes U, so it s a it s like a it s like the first linguistics course for linguistic majors at University of New Mexico.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Oh, that s so cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It s only it only picks up ambient sounds. And she likes to walk around, so sometimes the sound gets rather distant because she walks away <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">from the podium, which is bad (audio gap). I m sure (inaudible) next time, just because she can hear herself doesn t mean that we can hear her. But it s a good course. And it s basic, but (audio gap). [0:30:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">So I was telling her all this and that was fine. We get back home. And somehow, I feel that she s just generally sort of annoyed or something. So then I get back. I ve recorded the Formula One race in Bahrain. So I sit down to watch the Formula One race. I m watching Formula (audio gap). She s talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201191\">on the phone in the other room, back home, as she does on Sundays, to Ireland. And then she gets out the ironing board, ironing her scrubs. And she hates to iron the scrubs. And I know this, but she doesn t say anything about it. She s just ironing her scrubs. And (pause) so then I thought, well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201192\">I do have two pair of cotton trousers that actually (audio gap) iron, so I call out to her. I said, When you re done, just leave the ironing board out, because I m going to iron a couple pair of pants.

I m just going to iron some pants. She goes, You ve never ironed. In nine years, you ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">never ironed. (pause) So then I m like, Why is she so angry? And I said, Barbara  <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Is she just she s kind of agitated or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: I said, Barbara, you re just factually wrong.

She goes, You ve never ironed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">32:57 And I m like it s baffling to me that she s using the word never.

What s the big deal? This doesn t affect her. It s not inconveniencing her at all. Because what actually it makes (inaudible) if I iron, that means I have to put away the iron and I have to put away the ironing board, right? So it makes her life easier if I (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Right.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: So then I said, Barbara, this, you should remember. Do you remember when I bought a new white dress shirt and we had the old iron and the old iron stained the collar and I had just taken it out of the package? Was that me ironing, or was that you? Who put the stain on the shirt? (pause) She <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">goes, Well  she goes, Yeah. She goes, You ironed once.  Well, even if it were only once, once is more than never.

[0:34:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">She s like, I don t know why you re making such (ph) a big deal out of it.

All I want to do is iron (laughing) a couple pairs of pants. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">If anything, it s helpful to you. She goes, Well, I m bored with this. And [I said,] (ph) You re bored? I m irritated, and you re the one who started it!

And never is it a case where you are going to lie or exaggerate to paint me in a good light. You will lie and exaggerate or misremember and it s always putting me in a negative light. And I said, Why is that the (audio gap)? How would you like it if I just sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201351\">of periodically and randomly made (audio gap) up and just out of the blue said something that was negative about you and you knew it wasn t true? (pause) Like, You ve never made curry,  to which she would go apeshit, because she likes making curry. It s like, of course you re going to defend yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201352\">against that. [0:36:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: And I said (laughing) so I said, In this wide world, we have to do all kinds of stuff. Why (ph) is it between us, we have to actually deal with defending ourselves against stuff? And I said, By the I did not initiate this. You re the one who was so adamant about me never, ever having <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201391\">ironed. Why did you stick to your guns, even after saying such a thing? Why were you so adamant that I ve never ironed? Why did it matter so much, that I be seen as someone who never ironed? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: What did she say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: She can t tolerate that sort of sustained conversation, because she because she goes ballistic. And I said, And if you want, you can call my mom right now. Because the fact is, I enjoy ironing. And you can ask her and she ll tell you from the age of eight, I ironed all my own clothes. As <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D1\">soon as it was safe to actually use an iron, I ironed all my own clothes, and my mom will verify that. And I said, In addition, my dad does the (audio gap). There s a tradition of the men in my family. Not only do we do laundry, I iron clothes! (laughter) [0:37:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: It s a well-worn (ph) tradition. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I was like, we don t mind it s like, my mom washes tons of stuff. My dad washes clothes. It s like, my dad it s easy, right? How hard is it just to throw stuff in the washing machine and dryer? It s not a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: I mean (audio gap) thing. He does the laundry. (pause) Now, he has strong opinions about how the laundry gets done and he s very specific about what detergent to use and how much and he will tell you very carefully if you re doing it (audio gap). But it s his thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: Is that right? Okay. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah. So he takes it seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: And what is it, though when she said that to you, initially, as she what did you detect in her tone towards you? What did you kind of feel <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: Well, I felt like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 38:43) in other words. You were getting into that a little bit, like this (crosstalk) [0:38:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: I feel so it s tinged with this anger and negativity. And I feel like (pause) I feel like I feel like it s a class thing in England where her dad was always at the bar (ph?) always at the pub, drinking. (Audio gap) was always doing stupid things. Things (audio gap). Cars got smashed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201511\">He was always sort of making mistakes. And so when her mom left, Barbara had to take care of the house. Because her mom, when she was 16, just took off just took off for a year and lived with some other guy for a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20150-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20150-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563489\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">THERAPIST: Is that right? I never knew that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah. Very strange. Her mom (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk). [0:39:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">CLIENT: But anyway, the bottom line is, Barbara is studying for her A-levels (sp?) and having to take care of the house and wondering where her mom is and taking care of having to take care of her dad and chase him down to the pub. So she s cooking dinner and going to school and studying for A-levels. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201591\">So I feel like every time every time I m not being super productive... meaning (ph) she is obsessive about taking care of things. So there she is. She s ironing. And she s cleaning. She s always doing something. Just can t sit down. Anyway, so there I am. I m like, Hey, I ve worked all week. I m <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201592\">going to watch Formula One. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">CLIENT: Right? But she s in there doing (inaudible).

So there s that. But it s not like I should be doing her scrubs. It s just sort of she s doing her scrubs, and I m watching Formula One, and (inaudible). So I feel like I feel like she sees men as being a letdown, which is also that is a class thing in Ireland, right? The men are <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201611\">always at the pub. And her dad was always at the pub. Well, I am not at the pub. And I m reliable. I m not going anywhere. I m not I m just kind of a steady guy, who s here. But I m sitting on the couch, watching Formula One. I don t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">CLIENT: So I feel like whatever irritation she has with men being lazy, she puts on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">CLIENT: And it s sort of like, (chuckle) I wasn t doing anything. I wasn t doing anything.

No, she was just feeling that. She was just aware of some sort of feeling about men. And kind of well, yeah, transferred it to you. Yeah. For certain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: But what I don t get... (pause) And I m sure maybe I do the same thing. [I guess] (ph) maybe it s maybe I do do the same thing. I don t know. But it s sort of like, I m so clearly not her dad. Although maybe she thinks I am. Maybe I am like him in some way. I don t know. (pause) [0:42:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">Except he was tiny. He was jockey tiny. Five feet tall and 100 pounds just this itty, bitty guy. I m the opposite, clearly. (pause) (inaudible) Anyway... (pause) Once that s in the house once that s the dynamic, it s like, how do you shift gears, right? Anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Well, what yeah, what kind of what unfolded from there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">CLIENT: Well, so then I m just I m just irritated. And then I m just I m not a level 10 angry. I m just sort of like a level seven, just sort of like, this is just annoying, but whatever. So then I m like, all right. What am I going to do? (inaudible 43:32) now it s 4:00 in the afternoon. It s Sunday <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B1\">and I m dealing with the fact that it s Sunday, and which always sucks for a teacher the feeling of shit (ph).

So I m dealing with that. And then she wants (audio gap) sand and all that snow shovels, all that put away. And she didn t say it, but I knew she [said that] (ph). And so I m like, All right. Fine. I ll do that. So I go. I fix the garage door, which needed to be fixed. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F1\">fixed the garage door. I put away the sand. I put away the salt. I hurt my back in the process, which irritates me because now I feel like... (pausing) I m really nursing it because I feel like (inaudible) had to lift this 80 pound bag of sand from the ground and I feel like 80 pounds is not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F2\">bad, but when you re lifting it from the ground and you ve got a history of a back issue so then I m like, Oh, God, help me. (inaudible) again. [0:44:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20181\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20183\">CLIENT: Right? So then I m like, God damn it. If I weren t mad at her, I would ve asked for her help and we would ve somehow finagled this thing together. But because I was mad at her, I tried to lift the whole 80-pound thing, and I did. But it s like, in the process, might have messed up my back, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201831\">so I m sort of worried about that. And anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">Then I came back in. Called my mom to say hey. Talked to my dad. Talked to my sister. My dad was going on about the Game of Thrones, which was boring to me because I don t (audio gap) I ve never watched it, but was trying to summarize he was trying to basically tell me everything about Game of Thrones, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201851\">and that s fine. I just happened not to have seen it. It doesn t really sound like my cup of tea, because I m not into dragons. [0:45:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">So anyway so he did that. He talked about NASCAR. He was irritated with irritated with the rule change in NASCAR. He talked about Dale Earnhardt, Junior, as usual, because he likes Dale Earnhardt, Junior. Talked to my mom. That was very funny, because she s always very funny. We talked about CNN <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201871\">and the missing plane. We talked about the cast of characters on CNN who their job specifically is to talk about the plane, but now we really like these people. I don t know if you watch CNN.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">THERAPIST: The CNN people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">CLIENT: The CNN people. So there s this cast of characters that I like, and they talk about the plane nonstop, because CNN has really, really taken this story under its wing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible). [0:46:36].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible), exactly. Precisely. (inaudible). And because meanwhile, The New York Times, good luck finding anything about the plane because it s been totally backburner because, of course, life goes on. There s other issues in the world. But CNN <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">THERAPIST: Oh, but CNN keeps going. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">CLIENT: CNN is nonstop airplane. And I think that the people who discuss the airplanes must have been really confused and 46:58 for about a day and a half over the Fort Hood shooting, because all of the sudden, the plane was pushed to the background. And mom and I were talking about, What did they <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201931\">do? Did they hang out in the green room? Did CNN tell them, it s like, This Fort Hood thing is a pretty big deal. You got two days to get out of your hotel room, guys, and we re just going to or we re not going to pay? What s the treatment of the people, right? [0:47:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20192-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20192-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563489\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20195\">So then we were talking about how we how we really (inaudible) like them. And I told my mom, I said, Even when this whole plane thing dies down or they find it or whatever. (inaudible) in Australia and they can t send the ships and planes out anymore and the story really kind of goes away, we need <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201951\">to have a spinoff show. CNN needs to have an hour each night where these guys the same people just talk about whatever. And then I said, What would be really great is you have all of these pilots and (inaudible) people who we ve grown to love during when we have the NFL season, they just have an <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201952\">hour a week, and they just talk NFL. (laughing) And we have so we have this English guy. His name s Samuel Lewis. And so he s (laughing) really dramatic. Any time anybody says anything, he leaps out of his chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20197\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20199\">CLIENT: (laughing) (inaudible) just like this guy, Samuel Lewis. And his specialty is aeronautics.

We d like these people. They could talk about anything. We ll listen to them. [0:48:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A1\">CLIENT: My mom thought that was a great idea, to have a spinoff show. And they were talking about (inaudible) the plane is intact on the water, how unlikely would that be. But then if that s the case, (inaudible) referenced the scariest movie I saw as a kid, so I was seven. Airport 77 came out where <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A11\">the plane landed on the water and then sank. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">CLIENT: Did you did you ever see that?

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. So my parents, for some reason when I was a child, didn t have a problem just taking me to whatever movie they wanted to see. (chuckle) So yeah, so as a young child, I saw Jaws. I saw Airport 77 where a 747 lands on the water and it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. No good there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD1\">Also, as a young child, saw One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest because my mom and dad wanted to go see it. Anyway, I saw lots of stuff that I shouldn t have seen. Anyway [0:49:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow. Yeah. Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B1\">CLIENT: So anyway, I said, So maybe it s Airport 77. Maybe the plane landed and it sank. But the only problem with that is, a plane (audio gap) and in Airport 77, it landed in the Bermuda Triangle. So it only went down about a hundred feed and it rested on the bottom of the ocean. But a plane <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201B11\">(chuckling) sinking down 14,000 feet is going to get crushed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B5\">CLIENT: Right.

(Audio gap) cannot comprehend <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C71\">the wonder of the New Yorker cartoons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Well, I think I think (audio gap) I mean, it s like it s something that we ve been we ve been (audio gap) talking about a bit, is the is kind of what it brings up for you to kind of gah to bring to bring about aspects of who you are that she doesn t she doesn t care for. Or <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201C91\">(audio gap) in the case of the kind of the transference, bring up something that really, really upsets her, like Yeah, boy, that something that you re doing right now kind of reminds me (laughing) of my father without her saying that. [0:53:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201CB\">But I was just thinking about what it I think what I was thinking about were all these ways in which that you end up feeling like certain things that you re bringing you re bringing to light about yourself, at least, with, say, the New Yorker is kind of dealt with by her in with a certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201CB1\"> that she ends up treating it like, I don t even know what you re talking about. That doesn t make any sense to me. And... (pause) I guess (inaudible) I m just thinking about what how it then feels to you when she gives you a response like that. And how I think what you end up feeling like is <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201CB2\">that there s a lot of stuff about yourself that you just don t you don t feel like (audio gap) you don t want to share with her. She (chuckles) there are certain ways she doesn t she doesn t respond, for whatever reason. [0:54:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201CD\">And I think it I think it really does create some gaps between you two. I mean, not just not just that she doesn t get the New Yorker cartoon as much as I think it has to do with her kind of it s (audio gap) what I imagine (inaudible) been talking with her about linguistics, like, well, she wasn t <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201CD1\">challenging at least she didn t bring it up that she was challenging you, that she was listening (chuckles) to you, as opposed to the New Yorker, where it s like, Why are you reading these things? Get rid of them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N201CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563489\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201CF\">CLIENT: Well, it s like what you mentioned last time about the boxes of books downstairs and the idea that she doesn t want to actually know what s in the box so they just look like a bunch of boxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that s right. That s right. The kind of not wanting to look into you and into that about you. Or I want to see you a certain way, and you try to tell her, Listen, I m not that way. I m (laughing) not your father, and I m not I m also (audio gap) New Yorker and has these sides to <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201D11\">myself that you re not seeing. (pause) Yeah.

It s hard. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201D51\">I think this stuff is hard for you, to know that stuff (inaudible) can have an impact on you, the way she responds to you. And in some ways, I m feeling like you re like, I just don t want to share that with her. I don t want I don t want her to go anywhere near it or I don t want I don t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201D52\">to be anywhere near her when I m into that. (pause) Well, listen.
