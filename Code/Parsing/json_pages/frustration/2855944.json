Not because of anything about the birthday party but it\u2019s just I\u2019ve been in seven different beds in ten days and I was just ready to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Pretty weary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yes, so the it was interesting. I mean it was fine in terms of my dad and me. The I think one of the things I noticed was the anxiety from all parts of the family manifested itself in all sorts of different ways. My nephew, he was just, he\u2019s a teenager but he was just so I guess annoying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to my sister as teenagers can be. But I could see that he\u2019s a very shy boy and so for <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Your sister his mom or is she another aunt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: My sister, yes his mom. And I think everybody was experiencing anxiety in different ways. I know I was and Julie was and even my sister-in-law. My one sister-in-law works at a, what she calls an abortion clinic. And my other sister-in-law is on the opposite side of the spectrum and that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">just igniting fireworks and God only knows what. But it was really amazing that it didn\u2019t come to fists or deaths. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So there was just some basic anxiety and then there was the whole music thing was just a train wreck. We were supposed to play music, have a sing-a-long kind of thing and that was just horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What derailed it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Lack of audience participation [laughing] and probably unclear expectations. I think part of the problem before it happened, the planning and all that, we were not sure what we were doing. I mean we knew we had to play songs but it was okay are people going to sing to these, are people going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">to want to sing, are we like a Karaoke machine, what is the deal? And I just felt like we were in a fishbowl and I thought this was just weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">So that was disappointing because it just ended on this kind of odd turn of events. The neighbor two doors down started lighting off all these fireworks and we said okay, I guess we\u2019re done. But anyway it was disappointing. I felt just like this is just stupid; we didn\u2019t prepare. This is so I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">it does raise a question about what my expectations were and did they get enough information? Were we all on the same page? All of these things, and I\u2019m okay <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: How did your brothers react to it not going the way you had planned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Similarly. I don\u2019t think they were as upset; I don\u2019t think they had prepared as much. But I mean I\u2019m okay with it as a lesson for understanding what my expectations were and what, how informed they were, how perhaps impossible to meet they may have been. Even to meet you halfway seems like it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">wasn\u2019t possible, and whatever. So I understand that my anxiety going into it was based on expectations that were not going to be met so I was kind of setting myself up for a collapse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">So the same nephew was supposed to play a trombone solo on a song that he had practiced. I had told him what it was and after that he said no way, I\u2019m not getting up there. He\u2019s just really shy and I don\u2019t know. I think people think we were up there because we feel comfortable being up there and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">not necessarily the case. And so if we\u2019re going out on a limb they should come out with us. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">Anyway, that is over, thank God. And the weekend before that was playing music with my brothers and my friend Edward in Northern Nebraska. That was a lot of fun; more fun than I expected. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What made it more fun than you expected?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I think I played better than I expected [laughing] to be honest. And it was a new setting; none of us had been there before. My niece was there for the first time; she\u2019s 22 or 23. And yes I had a realization since getting back about the way I go about playing music is very different than the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">way my friend Edward, who I used to be in a band, bands with, college, high school and so on, and the way my brothers approach the music. And it\u2019s just different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">And I guess for me to impose my approach on them or to expect them to rise to the occasion is not very reasonable or fun for that matter if that\u2019s not what they want to do. And so it occurred to me that if I want to play at a higher level, the people around me, I think I need to find those people who <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">are willing and are able to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Who have it as a same end goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly, because I don\u2019t think my brother Steve has any I think he just likes to but, and that\u2019s fine but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: What world of music that, in your family growing up was ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: None of us. Well I mean we all played band instruments in junior high but no, I was the only one who played in any consistent time span, junior high, high school. No but I mean for everyone else it was no. But it has kind of brought us, some of us together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yes it\u2019s interesting how it does seem to have touched quite a number of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes well and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s getting passed down to the next generation it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. It\u2019s going to be great. I just need somebody to start playing trumpet and we\u2019ll have a horn section. [Laughter] Just waiting. Hey maybe, yes London should start playing trumpet. But yes and it\u2019s a way, I mean as I envision these things down the road, I think in order for these kids <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">to be inspired and very interested (ph) it\u2019s going to have to be something that\u2019s a little more than playing some Woody Guthrie song, no ill respect. Something that they can see the value of what they\u2019re doing at school in the real world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yes, and have it be fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s just it. I mean and that\u2019s, I mean that\u2019s really the key I guess and if I, I guess just done it, put my approach on them. But we\u2019re playing Sousa marches and whatever else, songs from the Music Man at school whatever they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s one part of music and if through this they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">can explore other things that are not so traditional or even fixed perhaps it could be more fun. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">So, but I think probably the biggest thing, because I was kind of embarrassed about that music playing with my family I just felt like I played horribly, it cleared everyone, it was just a train wreck, all these things, it\u2019s actually spurred me to pick up my [inaudible at 00:11:46] for an hour every <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">day since and I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to go. It might go nowhere but it\u2019s also part of an attitude that I\u2019m trying to develop with a lot of things that I\u2019m doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going but I want to do it more. And I might run into roadblocks, I might not have a clear idea as far as if there\u2019s some sort of output from it, I know it\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about in the past as far as producing something. But I\u2019m trying to do the same thing with this story <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">on Islamic finance mortgages that I picked up again yesterday, and the whole ballroom dance competition thing that I want to do, which I picked up again yesterday as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">And I think when I last saw you I went to ballroom dance competition and actually that was a Friday that was, well whatever. It was a Friday that I last saw you; it was that night and Saturday night. And funny thing was there was judge there who I know from Indianapolis; she flew in to be a judge at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">this thing so I was able to talk to her on Sunday about this thing. And I tossed around an idea with her about doing just a short piece on the Paso Doble. You know what that is? It\u2019s a crazy, crazy dance that you probably know a little bit of this. It\u2019s part of this international Latin five-dance grouping, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">which is Cha Cha, Samba, Jive, Rumba, and Paso Doble. But it just seems like the odd man out; it\u2019s just like this weird thing. You don\u2019t social dance Paso Doble; it\u2019s just this theatrical thing <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Very dramatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s very dramatic and it\u2019s very bizarre and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s the bold one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yes and it\u2019s very funny to watch, for me. I think it\u2019s hilarious because you see the expressions on these people\u2019s faces they\u2019re just so dramatic and comically so I think in some ways. But anyway, just as far as how did this dance become part of this set, what\u2019s the history, what is it tied <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">to? Is it some sort of Flamenco influence, is it, what is it and how do people approach it because it is so different from all the other dances they do. The moves aren\u2019t necessarily transferable to the other dances, things like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">So anyway, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with that but I\u2019m just going to keep pushing it forward knowing that I\u2019m interested in it. And that, and we talked about this to an extent, but it\u2019s really becoming more and more present to me that having an endgame is not necessarily all that important when you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">starting out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right. Letting yourself just sort of follow a task and see where it goes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes. I mean I do know for example the [inaudible at 00:15:08], having some experience with music, what things are possible and likely for the outcome. But something like this I don\u2019t know but I hope at the, because I get -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: The hope is you\u2019ll learn about it, that there\u2019ll be a valuable story there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But you can\u2019t necessarily know what the story is until you pursue it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly and to not sit there on my hands and say well, this is absurd for all these reasons that I could probably come up with. So anyway -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I mean it seems like it\u2019s something that\u2019s caught your interest. This other person didn\u2019t think you were totally crazy for pursuing it and coming up with, kind of sounds like fostering your ideas a little bit -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: That\u2019s better; her last name is Foster by the way. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: [Laughing] I know that would\u2019ve been a great pun. And, yes, there\u2019s it does seem it\u2019s a good opportunity. The world is actually getting a little more clued into dance from some of the popular shows now. So there\u2019s, like you say Paso Doble, and people actually might know because they\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">either watched Dancing With the Stars, or So You Think You Can Dance; it\u2019s becoming a little bit, it\u2019s getting more mainstream. So there\u2019s a bigger audience for wanting to understand it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Absolutely and I think because it is so, because it is such, because it is a unique dance that\u2019s no way, you don\u2019t see it brought out at weddings, things like that, but it\u2019s just it has a story behind it that\u2019s different from Cha Cha or Samba, whatever. Anyway, so I followed up with some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">the people at that competition; I called them yesterday. One of them had a website that had believe it or not Paso Doble class last night, Thursday nights, starting back in June. I called him up can I come by and someone actually cancelled on him. There was no surprise, lack of interest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">But I talked to the guy and he was one of the competitors I wanted to talk to. And there\u2019s some kids I want to talk to, there are some people in their older years that I want to talk to and this guy said I can tape him and his program at some point. So yes I mean it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Cool, you\u2019re motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Well I am and I\u2019m also trying to keep the expectations really low. I mean the original idea was this big documentary. I\u2019ve never done those; why would I think and that\u2019s I think often the problem is that I think big -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t know how to break it down, the next step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t know how to break it down and I cower away from it in fear because it\u2019s so big. So yes, it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: So you don\u2019t have to give up that idea of big documentary someday -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: but it doesn\u2019t have to be all that or nothing at all. It could be maybe I\u2019ll do that someday and along the way here\u2019s this smaller chunk that you can pursue and see what happens with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: And I can -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Maybe it gets folded into something later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yes, absolutely. And I mean I think some of the things that, some of the challenges I see that are a little inhibited by are the talking to people. How do I get them to talk about something? If I\u2019m going to be doing this with a 90-minute documentary, whatever, that is going to be something I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">going to have to do a lot. Okay how do I learn that by doing a shorter piece? Things that don\u2019t have to be so scary. So, yes I mean there\u2019s just a lot of this breaking these things down into less scary chunks that I\u2019m not used to doing. You know that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Right. Letting yourself just have a conversation about dance and see where it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Well and the other thing about it is not having to worry if I\u2019m doing it right because the more I look at people doing things like journalism for example, the more I say to myself well I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing it and I could certainly try to find someone to shadow for a day, but how would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">I do it if I were told, if I were asked how would you do this and would I come up with something that is better than the way someone else has been trained to do it or how someone else would train me to do it? And I think kind of the idea of making it up as you go along as long as you\u2019re making it up <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200812\">from thought and not just -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yes, and you don\u2019t necessarily need to find a way that\u2019s better. You just need to find a way that works. And there may be lots of ways that work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: And waiting to learn those ways that work for someone else might be a waste of time. So I think finding out what works for me is what I\u2019m trying to do on a number of fronts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yes I hear sort of like a theme of permission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yes absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Self-permission to do things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yes and to I feel like I\u2019m eating lard and chocolate for the past two weeks or something to that effect. I go to the gym yesterday and I thought God I hate this. I hate this, I hate this, I hate this. [Laughs] And you know I\u2019m still trying to figure that one out but I know that I\u2019m not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">to wake up and say well I don\u2019t need to go to the gym anymore because I\u2019m fit. And <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: But I wonder if you can find a way to be active that you hate less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: I know. You said that before and I don\u2019t know if there is a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Have you tried Paso Doble dances?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Oh God. [Laughter] I don\u2019t have the bag, the spine for that I think. Besides I don\u2019t think I could keep a straight face. I\u2019m sure the laughter would be aerobic. But I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be. Maybe there\u2019s something there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Well you\u2019ve had this struggle with the gym for a long time because you don\u2019t like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t like it. I realize it\u2019s important; I go anyway. And I think, I was thinking about this yesterday actually when what is it, you said something about [pause] oh we talked about real work being something that you enjoy, like the real work of whatever. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been labeling as real <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">work and if you enjoy it then it can\u2019t be work. And it\u2019s almost like the reason I feel good when I leave the gym is because I\u2019ve done this awful work that I hate doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: It actually counts as exercise because you hated it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Exactly. If it were fun, I don\u2019t know, roller blading\u2019s not exercising. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s related but you know. But that idea and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I mean I do think that exercise is important both for your physical health, it\u2019s really good for it\u2019s a great treatment for depression and anxiety so it can serve so many purposes for you. It doesn\u2019t have to be horrible or in a gym in order to count as exercise. It\u2019s really just moving <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">your body so if one day you can find a way <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019ve got this theory that if I was carrying less weight it wouldn\u2019t be as difficult or hated because I just, I don\u2019t know. But [laughs] getting to that point is going to require more of something I hate. Anyway, it\u2019s what it is and I don\u2019t it\u2019s going to be one of those things that I will <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">have to look into and see what other things I can do that are not as -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well what did you like to play as a kid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Baseball. [Laughing] I played softball on the weekend. Oh my God I hurt myself so bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: [Laughs] I\u2019m sorry to laugh; I shouldn\u2019t laugh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: No you should, it\u2019s ridiculous; it\u2019s ridiculous. And it wasn\u2019t so badly but I had this swollen ankle for the past five days that I\u2019m trying to nurse back. But I certainly didn\u2019t stretch out and warm up like I should have. You only think of those things when family gets together. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the problem with sort of the weekend warrior. You do something totally different one day of the week or once in a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yes and you\u2019re just shot on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: The companies that have this team kickball, the moral boosters for companies. Yes, half your company\u2019s going to be injured tomorrow. [Laughter] This is something they\u2019ve never done or haven\u2019t done since fifth grade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: The ropes courses where it\u2019s like oh God. But yes, so anyway yes I mean I guess I just there are some things I like doing but I mean it\u2019s a matter of finding people to do them with. It\u2019s kind of like music but <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yes, things that require a group are definitely harder. But this time of the year is also a good time to sort of explore renting a canoe or a kayak and kayaking down the Charles; less likely to injure yourself. It is active; it may be fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: [Laughing] Yes, it could be fun. Yes, no it\u2019s true, it\u2019s true and yes. I mean, yes, I just, now that this weekend is behind me there\u2019s more opportunity I know. Moving in three weeks and all that is going to take a certain amount of preparation but anyway it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">to look at. But the idea of actually scheduling something like tennis or something else on those days when I go to the gym just seems like wow, can I really do that? Then it\u2019ll be fun. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yes you could do that. And it would count.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: It would count. No, it\u2019s crazy talk but I\u2019ll see what I can do. So I get back on Monday and, or no Sunday, and being so sore from softball I went down to get a massage at that place that I went, I go to that\u2019s on the up and up. And felt great. I had so much anxiety though, kind of pent up, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">when I left there I was looking for another place to go. And I went to another place I\u2019ve never been. And in the end it was what I was hoping to stumble upon and have happen however that\u2019s <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">I was not really happy with myself but at the same time there was a lot of clarity afterward, like what were the circumstances of this. I mean I tried to talk myself out of it all the way but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: What stopped you from letting yourself actually talk yourself out of it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Just wanting a release. Just thinking that this is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: That that was the only way to get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. I thought about going out and playing music, I thought about going to the gym, I thought about going out to where Charles is. And I kind of was thinking about the alcoholic who is just going to go and have a drink and I was just of a single mind that that\u2019s what I was going to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">And it\u2019s just interesting to me how much clarity there is before in terms of the resolve and how much clarity there is after but it\u2019s a different, it\u2019s a completely different kind of clarity. I mean one is just focused on one thing; after it\u2019s like okay let me intellectualize this, let me be able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">talk about this and mull (ph) over things why. Why the reasons, how did this happen? Well this, that and the other thing. And on the one hand it\u2019s I have to have this; on the other hand, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Or what\u2019s the assumption by that? I mean you said you sort of wanted the release; you were feeling anxious. What would happen if you didn\u2019t have it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I think I don\u2019t know the answer to that but I do think that part of the reason I was feeling anxious and maybe even most of the reason is because I\u2019m coming back from being gone for two weeks and I don\u2019t really have a job that I\u2019m returning to. And there\u2019s so it\u2019s okay what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">kind of patchwork am I going to do today to make me feel like I\u2019m making progress towards some sort of by-play. And I\u2019m not saying oh poor me, I don\u2019t have a job; this is inevitable. But it\u2019s more like back to the reality of the day to day existence where I need to make it happen and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Making it happen, yes, it is a lot of pressure. And it\u2019s just whether it\u2019s appropriate to apply it or not I don\u2019t know but people were asking me all weekend so what is it you do now and I answer well I do a little of this, a little of that. So since then I\u2019ve done a bit of work; I expect projects <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">every day. And when there is that balance then going to the gym and being able to write those things, I feel whole, I feel human, I feel like a good person, like the person that I want to develop more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">But the if I could look at my patchwork of things that I\u2019m trying to advance as something that another person working a 9:00 to 5:00 job with some bank might be really envious of as opposed to something that just kind of like why am I doing this, what, is this going anywhere, that attitude towards <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">each of these things which is let\u2019s push this forward as if it\u2019s fun because frankly things that I\u2019m interested in should be fun. And if I\u2019m not interested in them, why am I doing them? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">So instead of looking at this assemblage as kind of burden that might not lead anywhere why not look at it as something that\u2019s more of an exploration? But your question about if I don\u2019t get this release, what? At that point I wasn\u2019t really thinking about it on that level. I was praying. I was saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">if the next stoplight is red I\u2019ll know I should turn around or something, thinking of things like that. I won\u2019t push it. If there are hurdles in the way I won\u2019t do it. Those didn\u2019t, those didn\u2019t stop me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">But I wasn\u2019t thinking about what if. I was thinking, I guess I was thinking I don\u2019t have a lot going for me and this is going to make me feel better. This is going to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Did it make you feel better? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: No. It never does. But that\u2019s what I tell myself. But on another level and I was thinking about this earlier today is what connection is there between the fact that I go to these Asian massage places and my first sexual experience was with my Korean sister? The element of what could happen and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">it\u2019s the same thing to me, same significance. And so that excitement that this is, that come on in, this is okay. It was a secret then; it\u2019s a secret now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: That is a lot of parallels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what it is about it though because I didn\u2019t do this before I came back from France.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Well and you didn\u2019t seek it out. Right, I mean it just sort of, right? I mean the first time it was a surprise.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yes, it was a Groupon. [Laughs] Damn those Groupons. No, it was and so I don\u2019t know if this particular vice has more resonance because of the similarities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Well I think, I mean you certainly didn\u2019t go seeking it out; I don\u2019t think it was planned. However the response to after that first experience being to repeat it, to go back. And this sort of mixed relationship you have with it where in some ways it feels like it\u2019s a good thing, something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E11\">you want, and then some ways it\u2019s really something you don\u2019t want, don\u2019t want to want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: And apparently don\u2019t want. Yes so I don\u2019t understand how to regard it by looking at the span of my life and between drinking, oh man, and having one-night stands, whatever, all those things don\u2019t point back to that. But this one has a strange eerie kind of reminiscence and again -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the similarity and the feeling you have about the experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: The anticipation; it\u2019s exciting. The belief that if this were wrong it wouldn\u2019t be legal or if this were wrong it wouldn\u2019t be allowed by my father or between my sister and me or whatever. Even though it was kept secret for a reason. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Right. So sort of that mixed idea of whether or not it\u2019s really, is it really illicit? It\u2019s sort of illicit but is it sort of testing, pushing the boundaries of well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yes. I mean would I tell my friends what I do at home even when I was little? No. Would I tell anyone now? No. And I know it\u2019s not okay, I mean clearly. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s about all I have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">I do know that when I have a schedule, when I have things planned out, my days I\u2019m feeling good I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019ve got purpose all those things. Coming back on that Monday I was just thinking I\u2019m really, really sore and I\u2019m going to go down. And from there it just feels like a runaway train, one mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">So and I almost didn\u2019t tell you about this because it\u2019s so perhaps I\u2019m still kind of I thought I made progress and the other thing after I said to myself, talk about the clarity and intellectualizing, I said to myself well maybe you\u2019re just not ready to give this up yet. Maybe there\u2019s a reason. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">And yes, okay I guess maybe I wouldn\u2019t have thought some of the things I thought recently as far as maybe why I\u2019m doing this if that hadn\u2019t happened. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Well you\u2019re clearly not ready. You haven\u2019t found a way to not do it. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not something you should be working on because it doesn\u2019t make you feel good in the end. And because yes it is sort of in opposition to other things you want in your life. I mean you want your <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">relationship with your wife to be stronger; this isn\u2019t helping that. So I mean that\u2019s why you still work on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">But I think the step is to ask yourself those questions. As you\u2019re noticing that you have an urge to go start to ask yourself well what would happen if I didn\u2019t? What if I am anxious today? Yes maybe going would sort of provide that sort of release but what\u2019s going to happen to me if I don\u2019t have that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">release? To start to question sort of the assumptions that are behind some of the feelings that you can there\u2019s an assumption that you can\u2019t withstand the discomfort and it\u2019s an assumption that it\u2019s not really up to you but maybe they\u2019ll be some sort of divine intervention or something else that would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F32\">actually stop you. It\u2019s a start to question those underlying assumptions. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855944\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: I think, I mean I think you\u2019re right but I think when I\u2019m in that mindset it\u2019s very hard for me to speak to myself rationally and to say step outside so you know what will happen. And I\u2019m not saying to forget about it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: No I absolutely agree that it\u2019s something that\u2019s really hard to do because you\u2019re taking what\u2019s a really emotional state and trying to get it to communicate with the rational part of your brain. And reason and emotion are not the same language; it\u2019s hard to they\u2019re both really potent and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">but they don\u2019t you\u2019ve got all that emotion sitting in the back of your brain and your hunting (ph) brain and you\u2019ve got all your reason and logic way up here in the frontal lobes. They <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: You\u2019ve got to shake it up a little bit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: They connect, there are connections between those different parts of our brain but yes it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s different languages just going on inside your head. To try to get that feeling of I\u2019ve got to do this to kick off a red flag of really, do you have to do this, that\u2019s the and why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: I mean some of those things I was sort of doing but I, it\u2019s almost the rational just shut down. But the, I mean I\u2019m hoping the DVD guy calls so I can have some -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Right and that\u2019s, those are some of the skills that you\u2019d be sort of reinforcing in that group. But until the DVD guy calls you I will help encourage you to get those skills in practice also. Why don\u2019t we wrap up there for today? For our schedule I have us not meeting next week but meeting <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF1\">the following week? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: You\u2019re not here next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: I am here. We can meet -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: I think it was probably because I was hoping the DVD was starting but it\u2019s not so if you have next week available -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: I sure do that\u2019s why I check in with you. So I can do your normal 12:30 time on the 18th? And that\u2019s also what we have on the 25th. And then I am away that following week, the first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: As I\u2019m moving that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Moving okay, so we reconvene on Friday the 8th? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: Actually I\u2019m out of town that week. I\u2019m working actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: That whole week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: Actually, yes, that whole week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: So Friday the 15th?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I\u2019m going to the Chautauqua Institution to work for my old boss for a week. Interviews she\u2019s doing I\u2019m recording them for her. And strangely enough they have two sets of talks each day. And the other person who\u2019s there that week is Ken Burns so I\u2019m hoping that I have my mini documentary <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201151\">done by then. [Laughs] Anyway, so I\u2019m going to corner him and say hey, want to give me a job? Okay so I just need a pen. Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re welcome. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
