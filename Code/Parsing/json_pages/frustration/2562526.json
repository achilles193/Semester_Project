[inaudible] this morning, overslept.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Okay, so the trip was really fun. It was a little hard being the only one not in a relationship, not sending pictures to somebody and [inaudible] blah, blah, blah. But I kind of predicted that. I got in a big fight with Stephanie. Well a couple fights with Stephanie. One about Sergio and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I shouldn\u2019t talk to him anymore because he\u2019s bad for me, blah, blah, blah, doesn\u2019t care about me. If he cared he would be in a relationship with me, whatever. And then because I was just being negative about guys saying oh, nice dress or whatever, on the street or whatever, got in a fight about that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">that I should have more positive energy, and maybe that\u2019s the problem blah, blah, blah. [1:27] But other than that it was pretty uneventful, just fun. But then\u2026 and so then I got back at one a.m. My flight was at one p.m. on Monday. I got back one a.m. Tuesday. So I went to sleep and then I was\u2026 I should\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">taken the day off right after because I was tired and needed to catch up on sleep anyway. We had been up late, whatever. But I decided to go to work. And then we had events that\u2026 we had an event in the evening that I knew that I had to cover because [inaudible] had classes so she couldn\u2019t. But anyway, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">and then I get a message from Stephanie first thing in the morning that her sister, her sister who just had the baby at around the same time as my cousin had a baby in Chicago, her husband\u2019s father shot himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Oh my God. [2:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: And she wrote and said Hunter\u2019s\u2026 [ph?] she\u2019s like I don\u2019t know details yet and I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Hunter\u2019s father committed suicide. Yeah, so that was pretty upset\u2026 that was extremely upsetting. And so then she asked if I could come and bring her seltzer and whatever. And so I did <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">before I went to work; before I got ready for work I just went. And she told me that he shot himself in a park and that he had been fired or laid off one\u2026 a while ago, and had been out of work for a while and I guess had some debt, or was in debt, or considerable, whatever, debt, and shot himself. [3:37] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">And he has a wife and three sons, two of which are married, one of which just had a brand new baby. So that was pretty upsetting news and I just feel so horrible for the mom and just\u2026 I mean having been part of a family that has also had a suicide I can understand very well how horrible this is. It\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Who in your family committed suicide?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: My aunt. You knew this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yes, I knew this. Yeah, no, you told me. I just\u2026 we hadn\u2019t... we had talked about it last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Anyway, and I mean she certainly didn\u2019t shoot herself. She overdosed herself on I think her, whatever, her depression\u2026 whatever her medications were. But this is\u2026 and I guess he left notes for the kids, boys, for his sons or something, and maybe his wife. I don\u2019t know. [5:00] Why now? Or I guess\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">and then she\u2026 so she went to Wyoming for the funeral. She left on Tuesday night and she got back yesterday morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Stephanie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Mm-hm, and her mom and dad. Her sister and husband had already been there. He did it the night that they were supposed to leave. They drive to Chicago. They\u2019ve been driving to Chicago frequently to see the baby, [inaudible] and they were supposed to go to Chicago and he shot himself instead. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">And he\u2019s the\u2026 his mother\u2019s still alive so now she\u2019s a 90 year old burying her son from suicide, of all things. So I just feel really bad for them. But she\u2019s back and, whatever, she\u2019s doing all right, whatever, I guess. I don\u2019t know. I assume Leila and Hunter are still in\u2026 poor Leila. And she\u2019s breastfeeding. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">And to have a little baby and have to go through this is so horrible. So I took Wednesday off to be able to unpack and catch up on sleep and whatever, and that was good. [6:48] And I\u2019m going to see Stephanie tonight, I think. I mean it\u2019s just two\u2026 why two horrible things happening around me in the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">month. (pause) And then, like a fool, I decided to e-mail Lucas to make amends because in light of this stuff, I\u2019m just kind of feeling like life\u2019s too short to worry about whatever. So I just kind of was like I\u2019m sorry and I forgive you and I forgive myself and that sort of thing. [8:02] I wish you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200234\">the best, whatever. And he wrote back, wow, then wrote back this long diatribe, mostly in caps, about how I\u2019m such an asshole and that I... how can I come to him saying that after I betrayed our pact to not tell Stephanie, and now things are weird between [inaudible] and Stephanie. And Lucas can\u2019t talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200235\">about it with Stephanie or with Aiden [ph?] and this and that. And that I\u2019m so selfish and that my pride this and that. So I made up stories about him and I told her intimate details that I promised him that I wasn\u2019t going to tell him\u2026 her, tell anybody. And I didn\u2019t even know how to respond. First <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200236\">I was just kind of like I don\u2019t really know how to respond. I was\u2026 I don\u2019t think this was\u2026 I don\u2019t think anything has to do with my pride. I didn\u2019t know how to respond there was so much content. He spent a good however long\u2026 and then so I kind of didn\u2019t respond, and then he kind of came at me again <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200237\">with a bunch of other e-mails, ripping me a new one and calling me an asshole and I\u2019m a snitch. I was a snitch in jail. [9:20] I\u2019m like okay, cool. That my friendship with Stephanie is bullshit anyway so\u2026 oh, and something that was a big part of my life, ha, ha, ha. Because I was like oh, that I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200238\">share something with my friend that was a big, oh, blah, blah, bah. And then I didn\u2019t even know how to respond. So as I\u2019m trying to formulate many responses, the e-mails keep coming. He finally writes back, even in my most hateful and angry, whatever tone, I still feel bad and empathetic, and he felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200239\">bad for saying all that stuff. In the meantime, of course, I hadn\u2019t responded because he\u2019s just fucking going insane. Then I get an e-mail from Joshua [ph?] saying it\u2019s Joshua [ph?] hey, who do you think you are? Don\u2019t talk to my husband. Stay out\u2026 get out of our life. Get out of our life. And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002310\">like well\u2026 then I wrote back and I was like I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re absolutely right. I was just going for peace. Sorry, take care. [10:29] I was like what the fuck just happened? And then I wrote back something like okay, whatever. I\u2019m done with this. What was the purpose of this? And I didn\u2019t write back. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002311\">And I wasn\u2019t really\u2026 and then I talked to Stephanie about it and she was like I understand why you felt inclined to write to him in light of everything, but in light of everything, who gives a shit. Fuck them both then. Fuck them. Fuck them all. And I was like that\u2019s how I feel. I was going\u2026 literally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002312\">in light of this person dying and this other person dying and x, y, z, truce. What the fuck is going on with his wife in the e-mail? What is she\u2026 did he forward it? Did he tell her? Or does she have his balls in her back pocket? Yeah. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I was like okay, that was a bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002313\">call on my part, fine. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. But I\u2019m also not really sure how to react about it. [12:02] And then in the meantime I\u2019m also finding myself like, okay, well good. In light of everything, then, how do I get\u2026 force myself to stop talking to Sergio because obviously he isn\u2019t good <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002314\">for me and whatever. And how do I do that when I try to force myself to stop talking to him, but then I feel drawn to him or just lonely or whatever. And that Stephanie \u2026 and then it\u2026 that Stephanie kind of makes it seem like it should be so easy. And maybe it should be but it isn\u2019t. (pause) And Stephanie <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002315\">had said she wasn\u2019t feeling too pleased with the way that Aiden responded to the news of her sister\u2019s father in law or something. [13:11] I\u2019m not really sure of the details there, and what happened last night when they hung out finally, but (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562526\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: Well [inaudible] you [inaudible] talking about, and people picking on each other pretty horrible, I think. And it seems to me, as far as you and Sergio, and I\u2019m not saying [inaudible] I think he\u2019s treating you horribly. [16:54] I mean I know there\u2019s some things that upset you and ways you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">feel he\u2019s not treating you very well, but I get that when they\u2019re like\u2026 I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s obvious to me that he\u2019s being horrible. He might be; I don\u2019t know. But what I\u2019m saying is I think you seem to want help figuring out what to do about him, either how to be okay with seeing him or how to stop. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">I think it\u2019s very frightening to talk about because (pause) I mean so much of what you describe is people really taking advantage of and sort of betraying other people who are in vulnerable positions. [18:13] So I guess I imagine that there\u2019d be some way that I\u2019d make you feel horrible about it. I mean\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200253\">or that you\u2019ll wind up feeling horrible about it for having opened yourself up to talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: If I know more about what\u2019s going on I\u2019m going to use it against you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think that. Well what do you mean more about what\u2019s going on? And what do you feel like you [inaudible] about it that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on? Just in terms of our\u2026 more specifics about interactions or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well I don\u2019t know. I mean whatever that I feel, like I know\u2026 sort of what I know about the relationship is that\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t know how often you guys see each other. I mean my sense from things you said is once every week or two or so. [19:21] And that you occasionally go out more often. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">You don\u2019t [inaudible] stay and hook up. And that he has made it clear he doesn\u2019t want anybody to know and doesn\u2019t want it to be anything other than what it is. And that you somewhat regularly kind of bring that up, the status of things between you, and that you want it to be different and he\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562526\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">CLIENT: Goes nuts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">THERAPIST: \u2026kind of bails on the conversation.

Maybe that\u2019s what the whole thing is. And I have no idea. But see, when you say it out loud all in a row it\u2019s like duh, why would I continue seeing him. [20:32] It\u2019s degrading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: Which there\u2019s actually truth to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So maybe that\u2019s more like it, that you\u2026 I think you feel degraded thinking about it, or laying it out like that. I think also there\u2026 you have the sense that (pause) really I\u2019m thinking that you\u2019re being bad and doing this wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think that.

And maybe my Mom would think that. I don\u2019t think you necessarily think that. I mean I feel like you would more be along the lines of the feeling that this kind of behavior is prolonging my misery or something. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: I guess I also got the sense that\u2026 the things you know about why it\u2019s hard to stop seeing him, I mean, are that you feel lonely and he\u2019s attractive and the sex is good, and if you\u2019re not sort of wanting something else or talking about wanting something else, you have fun together. [25:06] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Then I always feel disappointed anyway, no matter what, at every interaction I have with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Because it\u2019s sort of overshadowed by knowing [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: For that\u2026 like I deserve better but can\u2019t find it for some reason.
