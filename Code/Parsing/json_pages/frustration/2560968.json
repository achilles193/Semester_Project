I can start early.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Are you sure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I may have told you the wrong time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: It\u2019s no big deal. Yeah, because I had (unclear) on my calendar and it seemed like I weird time but I know you knew you did 45-minute slots, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I do 45-minute slots and usually allow 15-minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yes. Cool. So yeah, thanks for taking me early. So Baltimore was actually a lot of fun. We had a really, really good time and then had a really difficult (unclear) conversation on the flight home. You know, I kind of told her where I was at and she told me where she was at and in her mind like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">I\u2019m not where she needs me to be, you know, like I\u2019m not ready for kids or family or to settle down right away and those things are super important to her and that was pretty much it. You know, we\u2019re not in the same place and it was sad but it also was nice to have that kind of closure on things. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">we talked a lot about a lot of different things and like I told her, you need a lot of appreciation. You want to feel really appreciate and feel real good about yourself and I think I do that but in a different way than you are expecting. Like I fixed her car. I helped her move a bunch of times. I felt (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And like that doesn\u2019t register as appreciation. Like in her mind it\u2019s fine that that happened but because it\u2019s I\u2019m going to hold her hand or I wasn\u2019t really talkative, that is sort of like, not good. So there is sort of that disconnect or \u2013 not disconnect, but like a misalignment of like for me to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">there it\u2019s a lot of work, right, because I\u2019m always having to be kind of hard on myself and when I\u2019m tired or have my guard down and can\u2019t be myself it\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to be somebody else. And I think she understood that. She was upset about all of that, was upset but in general it was good to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">that closure and it feels a little bit like I can now have a new relationship with somebody and be excited about it and not have to worry about baggage on top of baggage on top of baggage to go through to get to a good spot. Like I can just kind of start at square one and build from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: You mean, the baggage meaning pursuing a relationship with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Well, everything that happened, it\u2019s not like that had ever stopped being \u2013 like you said, the issues never stop being issues, but also the fact that she did what she did, I did what I did. You know if she hits me, we break up. She reaches out to me after she has a threesome. Like (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">that I cheated on her. Like none of that ever goes away and it becomes a point where she was like super-irritable and super short with me but in her mind it was like it stopped not being about us and started being about an innocent \u2013 these are her words, not mine. It started being about me kind of just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">fitting into where she wanted to go. It was no longer about us figuring out where we wanted (unclear). It was about what she wanted and I hurt her a bunch before and so it was like this is where she\u2019s going and I\u2019m either along for the ride or not. And there\u2019s not a whole lot of other stuff that can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">go on there. It was shitty but it was good. It was nice to have a closure. But it\u2019s still tough though.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560968\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">(Pause): [00:04:01 00:04:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: It\u2019s tough because I know I love her, you know. And there were certain things that we had that were really good. (Crying?) And even with all the bad shit that we went through it wasn\u2019t \u2013 the good stuff was always still there. But it just is not \u2013 the timing is not \u2013 I told her, if we had met <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">\u2013 if we crossed paths when I was 32, you know and you were 30, or 31, or whatever she was, but that\u2019s a different story. If I met you when you were 26 and I\u2019m 28, it\u2019s a different story. Like it just felt like we were \u2013 kind of, eventually I\u2019m going to want those things but it probably won\u2019t be any <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">time soon and that\u2019s super important to her. And that\u2019s like not going to work for her. And see that was \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 it was nice to have the closure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">It\u2019s just shitty because I feel like \u2013 people like that, they complement you, they crown you \u2013 they\u2019re good people, but something wasn\u2019t right between us and we tried a bunch but it never felt quite right and I think she felt that too. And in talking about it I was actually surprised that she took it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">as well as she did because it was like she had a bunch of reservations too and it was like a relief for her and it was hard, but it was a relief for her to sort of have the discussion about it. But it still sucks though because it\u2019s like you spend a bunch of time on something like this and you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">it\u2019s going to work out and it doesn\u2019t and you kind of have to look at it like, it was good and I learned more about what I don\u2019t want and more about what I do want in somebody and maybe next time it works out better. And hopefully she learns some stuff about how she feels and what\u2019s important to her <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">and you know, she\u2019ll be better off for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">It\u2019s still just shitty because it someone you spent a year-ish with on and off, you\u2019re left with \u2013 and so to sort of lose that partner as a friend. But still it\u2019s tough to \u2013 I think it\u2019s just tough to get over, you know over the hump of \u2013 we had so much baggage built up but it was always sort of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">waiting for the other shoe to drop. You know, her or me, it was not the place where you want to be with anyone, you want to spend a lot of time with waiting for the next bad thing to happen. You kind of want to be able to go and say, okay you know it\u2019s good and you\u2019re not worried about that you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">go and just relax and have fun and it can just evolve the way stuff evolves. I think that\u2019s one of the things I realized is you know, if you trace this all back you know we go back to after I cheated on her and it was never the same after that. But I think ultimately what I realized most this time was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">that there\u2019s not with the defenses and the walls that she\u2019s put up, there\u2019s not space anymore for that like partnership. It\u2019s like this is what she wants and this is the direction that she\u2019s going in and I\u2019m either a part of that or I\u2019m not. It\u2019s not our way, it\u2019s her way. Let\u2019s not talk about our life <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">together, let\u2019s talk about her life with me in it. And that would maybe be okay at some early stage in our relationship but after a year of like serious stuff, that doesn\u2019t make you excited to want to be part of it. It doesn\u2019t make you want to put in that extra effort like kind of makes it work and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200255\">I think that also feeds into like her just general \u2013 she\u2019d just been real impatient with me lately and it\u2019s like that\u2019s where I think this comes from, this like it\u2019s not moving along as fast as she wants, but I told her what I told her, like there\u2019s never a relationship status that we could be in that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200256\">every going to be good enough, like that could fulfill you whether we live together or if we were engaged or talking about being engaged or we were married or we had a kid, like it would have never \u2013 like I never felt like it would have been enough for her. She says, all I wanted \u2013 she says, all she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200257\">wanted was a commitment that we were going to get married someday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560968\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">And so like, I still don\u2019t trust that that would have been enough because it would have been almost immediately, if I had ever proposed to her, it would have been like, okay, right \u2013 when are we getting married? When are we having kids? Like it would have all had to be \u2013 it couldn\u2019t just be and develop <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">in the way that felt right or happen organically. And one of the things that I felt good about is that I told her \u2013 I said, you know, you look like a lot for external validation and you look sort of externally for cues about what\u2019s right \u2013 so like all her friends on Facebook are all married, all have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">kids. You know, one of her friends started dating around the same time we started dating and they\u2019re moving in together and like all this and it\u2019s \u2013 you know, she sees that and is like, you know, that\u2019s all I want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">And it\u2019s like well, yeah, that\u2019s fine if that\u2019s all you want but these things always come out of the context of \u2013 Facebook is being used against me, right? One of your friends has done this and it\u2019s tiring. I think that\u2019s the other thing, too \u2013 it\u2019s emotionally draining when these kinds of things happen. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">I mean, I don\u2019t want that. I want to go have new issues with somebody new. And I want her to find somebody who is a little bit more aligned with her in terms of love and affection. And what she needs out of the gate is more in line with that they\u2019re going to give and then when they kind of go above <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">and beyond in her mind it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re just hitting it. In her mind it feels good. And then maybe it\u2019s that other stuff that I believed in. So, it felt very different than other times that we\u2019ve done this. It felt less \u2013 it felt much more relaxed and final, certainly hard but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like her response was different than what you had anticipated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I think it was. I figured she would have been \u2013 I mean she was upset, but I figured she would have been more upset. I think, ultimately it\u2019s a lot of work. You know, it\u2019s just nice to take a load off your mind, you know, it\u2019s not a thing, another stressor in your life and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">(unclear) and there should be something good, something to look forward to, and something that you\u2019re pleased to be a part of and I think that we both had that at one point and that we were constantly trying to get back to that and never could. You know? And it was like we had six really good months <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">and then you know, seven, eight months of just really tortuous, (unclear), or frantic, frantic something, you know, something relationship which I think just takes a toll. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560968\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">But, yeah, so we\u2019ll see. I have ups -and downs, you know. This is the most I\u2019ve talked about this stuff. It\u2019s still a little fresh. (Pause) But I think it will be good, you know, ultimately to just close that chapter and do what I think, you know, having some space and having some perspective on things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">will make it, you know, will make it feel a little bit less raw, you know, will probably hurt less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">(Pause): [00:13:47 \u2013 00:14:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a little harder than I thought it was going to be. (Crying) You know it seemed like it would \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether it would be easier, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: Well, your focus before was how can I get out of this? That was what you were thinking about, not these subsequent feelings of loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is why I know some time will let it, you know, mellow and I think it will be a little more like it was a good thing, and it happened and then it got really shitty, but you know, I think we\u2019re both better off, but I think it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, I think it will be a good thing. You know, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">even like yesterday, you know, riding my bike over to rugby practice, it just felt different, like if felt more relaxed and even at work I felt a little less stressed out like it just feels like I\u2019ve removed a stressor or something from my life. And you know, I told her it\u2019s tough for me to be with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200372\">you because you feel like it\u2019s never enough and I know it\u2019s my problem, but you know, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to change overnight and I feel like that with you for a lot of reasons but it\u2019s certainly challenging, you know, that adds an added complexion or dimension to the relationship or however <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200373\">you put it, where it\u2019s just hard and the analogy that I used was if I was an alcoholic I wouldn\u2019t be going out with all my friends who make me feel like I have to drink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">You know, I would avoid that situation to sort of get myself squared away. And that\u2019s why I feel it\u2019s a little bit of this is too, where it\u2019s like I don\u2019t like feeling that way. I really don\u2019t like feeling that I\u2019m not good enough because I know I\u2019m a pretty good guy and I know I put that on myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">but it\u2019s a way of removing that sort of stressor from my life, removing \u2013 not necessarily the cause of that, but removing the source of the stress allows me to focus on the things that I still feel good about with myself and to find somebody who I feel like I don\u2019t have that feeling because I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">it\u2019s tough to be in a relationship where you feel it\u2019s unequal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">(Pause): [00:17:15 00:17:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: I guess I also think it will be nice to sort of do my own thing, like not have to worry about checking in or whatever, with her. (Unclear) and not have to respond to text messages quickly or whatever will be nice. (Unclear). I guess we\u2019ll see. I really think I\u2019ll feel, I hope I\u2019ll feel better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">in a couple of weeks (unclear) happen. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">(Pause): [00:18:14 00:18:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes, so yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was a good (unclear). It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019d been there. So that was good. So rugby was intense. It was a really intense practice. And yesterday I messed my back up pretty bad so that was unfortunate so I\u2019ll miss next practice so I can get treatment <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">and then probably also Tuesday\u2019s practice which means I definitely won\u2019t be playing on Saturday which is disappointing. So sort of bad timing to be alone with your thoughts, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560968\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: What do you think it will be like to be alone with your thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I suppose a combination of things. It\u2019s a nice thing to do because it helps you clear your head and not being able to work out, not being able to play rugby, those are the sort of things I don to sort of reset and get some perspective on things, so I\u2019ll have to do those things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">on my own. I\u2019m supposed to read. I\u2019ll probably read. But it\u2019s just frustrating not being able to contribute. And also, not being able to play.

You can\u2019t recreate the past no matter how hard you try. But I guess it\u2019s a scary <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">thought. Because it\u2019s like you had something really good and you fucked up. And it seems that you didn\u2019t \u2013 you know I feel like it should be more obvious, but it\u2019s not.

You know it\u2019s scary to think about (unclear) relationships. You know it\u2019s a big risk too, because yeah, there might be somebody else out there but maybe there\u2019s not. Maybe this was a \u2013 but I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">part of that just comes with time. You know every time you get out there you start \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s like every time I\u2019ve ever broken up with a girl it\u2019s always good to have activities to go to because you can just kind of go through the motions and then you start to process things and you \u2013 but you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">can kind of get through it, but it\u2019s just bad timing. The injury time is just really, really bad because it\u2019s like I can\u2019t, I can do the things that I would do that sort of allowed the background to process really what\u2019s going on so it\u2019s like right in my foreground which is I think part of where it\u2019s coming from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">Like it\u2019s just like \u2013 I miss her and I\u2019m going to miss her.

But it\u2019s like distracting me from all the other stuff I need to be worrying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F1\">about or taking care of at work or other people or whoever it may be. So it\u2019s not the right type of distraction, but the wrong thing to be distracted by right now.

My girlfriend before that \u2013 I cheated on her. My girlfriend before that \u2013 I cheated on her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t know much about the woman you dated for nine years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, we were \u2013 we met in \u2013 we went to high school together and we had mutual friends. We met at a party in college because she went to MSU and I went to UMB. Or I went to Jesus, Amherst, like it just \u2013 it was really good. And we kind of \u2013 she \u2013 you know we dated all throughout college and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">was really good and her family and my family and everybody got along because it was really a good thing, but it never felt quite right for me. You know, there was something about her \u2013 she was not a good partner for me because she could neither sort of level with me and like keep me straight. I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B2\">a woman who is pretty strong and can argue shit off and she couldn\u2019t do that, like at all. And then also she wasn\u2019t decisive about anything and then not like the typical \u2013 where do you want to go for dinner? I don\u2019t know, whatever. Like every decision, generally, no matter now mundane went through her <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B3\">parents and like great people but I\u2019m not dating her parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">So when I was in Japan I ended up cheating on her with this girl I met at work and then when I came back from Japan I broke up with her. But that\u2019s one that like I look back at that and a final perspective will help a bunch with this when I look back then. I look and I say like, that probably should <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">have ended a while before it ended, like it was something where you know, we had both gotten into our respective ruts and then that was it. It was not like something to be excited about. It was just a thing and we were these people when we were together and it was like there was no spice in the bedroom, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D2\">there wasn\u2019t certainly diversity like hobbies, there was just nothing exciting or fun going on and we both sort of just came to that and you know, she always also \u2013 she went to MSU and she graduated in three years. I went to Amherst and graduated in five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">She ended up doing like terrible, ultra-low paying like $25,000 a year in communication and P.R. I went on to work at Google. You know, my starting bonus was more than her yearly salary. And that was very not okay for her because MSU was the better school. She graduated in three years. I graduated from <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">Amherst in five. You know, Amherst is definitely not (unclear) and like that resentment just was always right under the surface. And that\u2019s not like a cool thing to try to like live with or be a part of and certainly with time, no easy way to talk about that. And she also had like terrible \u2013 she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F2\">terribly anxious and that also fed into the whole like it\u2019s tough to try new things because the comfort zone is so well understood and so warm and cozy, but out there is being (unclear) and scary and I think we went on like two vacations over nine years and like went indoor sky diving and we went camping <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F3\">like once. So there\u2019s like \u2013 it didn\u2019t satisfy the part of me that needs to do stuff and have experiences. It was like it totally dropped the ball there. But that was different.

I can\u2019t come to terms with my saying that, you know? Like committing to it. It scares me a whole lot.
