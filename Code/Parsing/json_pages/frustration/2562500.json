I don\u2019t think you need to worry about it. I think it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Does it make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yes. I think it\u2019s complicated, but it makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It\u2019s disappointing, but it\u2019s disappointing anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right. Like the endpoint sucks whether it\u2019s five minutes earlier or later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. (pause)  I get to see you four times this week. (pause) Thanks for the receipt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Sure. (pause)  I hope everything works out with it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: We\u2019ll see. (long pause)  I was stressed about Sirius Moby because he seems really special. He seems really good and you recommended him highly. Jeremy does not want to see another old woman, so Riley Carver is out.  Maybe if Sirius Moby goes away from the list, then Riley Carver can get her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">spot back, but Jeremy does not want to see another old woman, he said. If Jeremy were the kind of person to travel to Medford without a car \u2013 we don\u2019t have a car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh. I figured he drove up to Marlborough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: He gets a ride. So if he were the person to make that big of a commitment to a therapist, I think some of the stuff that will come up in therapy won\u2019t come up.  I think he wouldn\u2019t need the type of help that I think he needs if he were to go and see Sirius Moby in the first place. Do you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">what I mean? So that initiative that that required is different from what Jeremy does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of like you don\u2019t think he\u2019ll make it over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t, but he is intrigued, so it feels like he\u2019s stuck because Fern Tom\u2019s office is like one block from our house. (both laugh) So it\u2019s stressful for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m laughing because there is enough room for an entire neurosis right there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: What? Having her right there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: The therapist who is accessible but who I probably didn\u2019t fuss as much about or who is not quite as exalted, in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: This is totally why it\u2019s stressful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Exalted, but who is nearly unreachable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes. So it\u2019s stressing me out because she\u2019s so accessible, but I didn\u2019t hear much about her and I want to please you or something. Also I\u2019m curious about Sirius. I want somebody to see him. I kind of want to see him. (pause) He makes children\u2019s\u2019 games. That\u2019s cool.  And he also talks about music <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">in his profile \u2013 which very few people seem to have, but he has one \u2013 and that intrigued Jeremy. I don\u2019t really think he\u2019s the right person for Jeremy because he\u2019s so hard to get to. It\u2019s one thing to be expensive, but it\u2019s another thing to list your rates out on your website when your rates are like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">$450 for a consultation and $300 for a 50-minute session, so that\u2019s a total turnoff for Jeremy.  It would have been for me, but I kind of get it now. I think it\u2019s not a trap for me because I think my attitude is well, we\u2019ll just get him to charge you less, which (both laugh) is often not how Jeremy works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Do you know anybody that works that way? I was just teasing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t know anybody that works that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562500\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: It says on his website \u201creduced fee.\u201d  There is some uninviting word attached to it, like rarely, but I think it said \u201csometimes\u201d it can be arranged. He will pass, but he hasn\u2019t passed yet. Also, that means that this painful . . . I don\u2019t know what to make of it. I don\u2019t know what to make of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">drinking a really strong beer and reading all the back issues of the Pine newsletter. (both laugh) (inaudible at 00:09:56)  I don\u2019t know what that is. I think it\u2019s a way to feel close to you and feel like I\u2019m figuring you out more, but it started because if you google Sirius, there is some stuff that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">comes up in a couple of newsletters. It\u2019s like candy, like I can\u2019t stop reading them; so half the time I\u2019m really confused because I think this should be my career. I meant being an analyst, but then sometimes being a patient should be in your career, too.  Sometimes it just seems completely tied up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">with you and that it\u2019s going to go away and I shouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to it because that\u2019s a big choice, a big decision. (pause) That\u2019s what\u2019s going on with him and it.  (long pause) It seems a little much. He works out of his house, which keeps coming up, probably because I\u2019ve had so many <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D4\">dreams about your house. Yeah, some of the house things sticking.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I sense that he feels to you like my people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Which is something significant about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes. I guess I want to know him or want him to know me or I want him to know us, like if he sees Jeremy he\u2019ll know me.  (pause) I guess I have the sense that he really wants to know us and he just doesn\u2019t know it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Sirius?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes. And not necessarily because of me, but because of how I view Jeremy and his issues and his gifts, I think. I don\u2019t know. I think he would be a rewarding case, a pretty tough nut to crack. It kind of seems like a right match, but it\u2019s not all because of the three things I know about him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">It\u2019s like the aura I\u2019ve made up around him.  (long pause)  Part of it feels like a simple matter of traction. It makes me feel like I have traction here. I think about him and I project things onto him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It feels a little like you would be moving into my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, or something. Or like something that you would covet. It has a little bit of a feeling like that, like you would be interested in what it was like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Like I would want to know about how he was with Jeremy and what Jeremy thought of him?  (pause) Well let\u2019s hope so. I\u2019m teasing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like too much to think about somebody coming into our life who you know and who knows you and who would be a window into something else, something about you. I think it\u2019s too much because it\u2019s not happening. If it were happening, I think it would be . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: It might be easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t have developed all this stuff around it so quickly.  (long pause)  I had a dream last Sunday night that I didn\u2019t tell you about, but it happened at your house. It was your birthday and I had showed up with a lot of people, like we had all come to see you for your birthday. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">seemed stressed about something and you were handwriting me hand-written notes. It seemed like it was happening over the course of many days, but the time wasn\u2019t clear.  (pause) Most of the scene was happening in a little dining room like a round table. The lights were off. It was daytime. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200552\">who I showed up with, but I showed up with some people, like maybe who were a little younger than me. I remember seeing the notes, but I don\u2019t remember what they said. In the next dream, which was sunlit, your mom was there with a baby girl, maybe like six or eight months old.  I don\u2019t think she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200553\">me, but she had these long, black eyelashes and black hair and she was very, very stunning to look at. She was really peaceful and happy and your mom was taking care of her. She was in a car seat or something. I think it was a car seat, like she was going somewhere. She was getting her ready to go somewhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200554\">and I went in and I saw her and I commented on her eyelashes and you said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s her favorite [best] (ph?)\u201d  You acknowledged my eyelash comment. You said, \u201cThat\u2019s her favorite best.\u201d (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562500\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I guess the stuff about Sirius Moby is pretty overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: It\u2019s pretty funny. (chuckling) I think it\u2019s overwhelming because it brings in so much stuff that\u2019s very unifying, almost. I really want Jeremy to see someone good and am really very entangled with it all.  And if I were able to let him go a little bit, I think it would be less overwhelming. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">I guess I\u2019m saying this points to how involved I am or how invested or attached I am to lots of things about that \u2013 and lots of things about you. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I think, as far as the stuff with me, it fits right in with your wanting to be part of my life outside of here which, in a way, is something that could also happen in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Like by way of Sirius Moby, by talking about him? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sort of correcting myself a little bit. Part of my life outside of my role as your analyst or whatever that sort of knowing someone who feels like my people, that sort of relates us differently in a way you really want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, and in a particular way in which we would know him.  It\u2019s not like some other kind of relationship. It would be intimate. (long pause) And sort of privileged, like we would know him in a way that you don\u2019t \u2013 or Jeremy would.  (pause) Looking at this differently, I think it would be very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">annoying for Jeremy if I tried to know him in the ways that I want to, so it\u2019s almost like this silent, implicit thing that I actually wouldn\u2019t have. (pause)  But it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s like no one else is going to be good enough for Jeremy and we can\u2019t let him go. It\u2019s like he\u2019s right and we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200612\">making a mistake and I wish Jeremy were different so that he could rise to a level of \u2013 whatever \u2013 that he would need to get to him.  At other times when I think about it, I have no idea. No one has any idea how he would be for Jeremy, how Jeremy would be for him. And does it really matter what the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200613\">analyst is bringing into the room when you\u2019re comparing different people who are all skilled? Does it matter what they bring into the room together? How am I going to know that? So it doesn\u2019t really fit the longings.  My longings don\u2019t really fit. (long pause) I think a pretty involved fantasy showed <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200614\">up pretty quickly around him. (pause)  There is also this longing for parity between me and Jeremy. Whatever he ends up doing will probably bring him closer to, I think, a parallel relationship with somebody else. Some part of me feels like I really need that.

He wouldn\u2019t be stuck in his own stuff or off someplace or dealing with it or finding something out or whatever.  He would also be closer to me. You would sort of be a fly on the wall in the sessions and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">it would teach you more about this kind of treatment from a different perspective and, presumably, about me and where I\u2019m coming from \u2013 other things about me based on who Sirius is and what he\u2019s like.
