(pause)  Yesterday at work, Marlowe forwarded an e-mail. [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:04) I send samples and data and all that stuff. So he sends me an e-mail, an interaction between he and someone that I\u2019ve talked to before in another lab that\u2019s a part of the project. He was basically forwarding <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">information that I\u2019m in charge of and he was like, \u201cHere. I just wanted to let you know, Molly, that I\u2019ve been talking to and e-mailing this person and can you help me get him some antibodies?\u201d I wondered why didn\u2019t you forward me the initial e-mail when he contacted you? I don\u2019t want to have to talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">to Marlowe about it and talk to this person? Why don\u2019t I just talk to that person directly? I was like, \u201cCan you forward me any e-mails like this in the future?\u201d  He got very angry at me and was like, \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s extra work for me to backtrack and see what you said <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">to him, whether you sent him the right things.\u201d He was like, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d I was like, \u201cExactly. You didn\u2019t know what\u2019s right, so why don\u2019t you just forward me the initial e-mail and just be done? Wash your hands.\u201d Later in the day, Ray comes by and said, \u201cDo you have Marlowe\u2019s replacement samples?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Is that a different thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, just something random.  I was like \u201cI\u2019ll ask Marlowe.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what he was referring to. I went to Marlowe and was like, \u201cRay said something about replacement samples?\u201d He was like, \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Blah, blah, blah.\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m just asking. It\u2019s my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">job to send samples. It\u2019s Thursday. It would be nice to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d He was just angry at me. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Blah, blah, blah.\u201d I was really upset because I asked you to do something? Should I be like, \u201cOh, please, next time?\u201d I\u2019m just tired of being nice to him <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">and his feelings. I never said he did anything wrong.  I was never . . . I was just like, \u201cCan you forward me those e-mails in the future?\u201d I don\u2019t know. So now it\u2019s going to be him angry at me all the time and giving me these scoffs and stuff like that. Even if I apologize for coming off as being rude, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">he\u2019s going to be like \u201cyeah, you are rude.\u201d (sniggers) I just don\u2019t want to put myself through that. You make work hard on me by doing these things. It\u2019s easier if I deal with this directly instead of going through you. I don\u2019t like going through you because I don\u2019t trust you. (pause)  So I\u2019m just frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">about that. I just don\u2019t want to deal with him. There\u2019s always some kind of drama. He\u2019s always coming up to me like, \u201cWould you please? I know you\u2019re so busy.\u201d Why can\u2019t you just be like, \u201cHey, Molly. I have these samples. Here\u2019s my list,\u201d and then be done. He\u2019s always more of a deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I see. There\u2019s a performance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Right, like \u201coh, you\u2019re so busy. You\u2019re under a lot of pressure.\u201d Well, I\u2019m not. It\u2019s just when people come to me with samples, I just want everything to be in order, your samples labeled correctly and then that\u2019s what\u2019s on the sheet that you give me. That\u2019s what the most frustrating thing is, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">when they don\u2019t match up or I have to do some deciphering and I can\u2019t find you and I\u2019m under pressure.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particular about it; it\u2019s just having it in order and having it in the database. He\u2019s always like, \u201cOh, I know you\u2019re under so much pressure . . .\u201d (sniggers) It\u2019s nothing I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">upset about. The main thing is I just don\u2019t want to deal with it. I don\u2019t want to have to put up with his snide remarks and looks and whatever.

(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: You find him really frustrating to deal with and he acts as though he\u2019s in a kind of emotional drama with you when you\u2019re there just to get work done.  I mean drama in the way that he gets emotional in his responses to you and, also, in the way he presumes to be taking care of how you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: \u201cOh, I know you\u2019re so busy.\u201d  I guess I just want to be done with it. I don\u2019t want to think about it, but I feel like I\u2019m going to be going into battle in terms of things I can say to him or what to do or what to say or not say. I just don\u2019t want to deal with it. I just don\u2019t want it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really not how you like to do things. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s having this anger has also made me feel a little bit better and not so focused on being tired or overwhelmed. It\u2019s just kind of woke me up a little bit. As much as I resent having to deal with it, there is an energy there or something.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I think there is some way that being pissed off at him woke you up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I guess one thought I had was maybe, at least so far, you\u2019ve made it pretty clear you think he\u2019s being ridiculous.  So if you\u2019re annoyed, that makes sense; it\u2019s not really on you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not thrilled with it, but (chuckles) if you say you don\u2019t hate him, whether that makes it, clearly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">not what you want, but at least more acceptable to be angry and upset, which I think you often feel like it really isn\u2019t.  But thanks to Marlowe (chuckles), sometimes it\u2019s appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Maybe because I feel like I have work to do but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m succeeding in the world, I\u2019m just angry at that and put it on him, like you\u2019re making my life more difficult or something.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: That may be true. I had in mind something a bit different, although maybe what you\u2019re saying is more what it is. What I had in mind was that it\u2019s a bit enlivening to be able to feel the anger without feeling so bad about feeling it; whereas if you\u2019re frustrated with yourself for not doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">well enough, you also feel like you\u2019ve got to really kind of step on that in order to be able to stay focused.  I guess I wonder if, with this, you give yourself a little more leeway, so that kind of helps you feel less tired or overwhelmed or maybe shut down. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Maybe. (pause)  I think I definitely feel the anger at myself and anxiety about trying to make things better or why are things harder, but I don\u2019t think I actively shut that down or feel bad for feeling that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562226\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: You mean in general?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, like . . . [I\u2019m trying to think.] (ph?) (pause)  He might have just known sometimes I get frustrated or angry, very overwhelmed, and maybe I do feel bad for feeling annoyed, but I guess I just don\u2019t feel like I suppress it that much.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: What\u2019s more paralyzing or making me feel stuck is being conflicted to what I do because nothing I do makes it easier on me or makes me feel better or alleviates the anxiety or anger. I get stuck or kind of conflicted with what do I do with this or how do I fix it? (long pause)  I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">My natural thought is I need to forgive or not be so serious about it or something like that or not be so weighed down by it. But it\u2019s kind of like with Marlowe, if I forgive him the e-mail came off as [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:01), but even if I apologize I\u2019m still going to get so much backlash.  It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">kind of the same way of forgive but nothing is fixed because he\u2019s still mad at me or there\u2019s still so much residual stuff there. (pause)  I don\u2019t know; maybe I\u2019m just being negative. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Your concern is that maybe you\u2019re being inappropriately negative about having to apologize instead of getting grief from him?

(pause) I guess it\u2019s just the feeling of being set up with him and not wanting to deal with it. (pause)  Maybe I\u2019m just tired with him, especially because I\u2019m always in the wrong; I\u2019m always doing something wrong when, in reality, I\u2019m the one who <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">is doing all the work or taking care of everything and he\u2019s making it hard on me. (long pause)  Feeling this way about work and being angry just doesn\u2019t fix anything \u2013 or forgive myself or forgive. [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:55) be angry. The problem is still there; it builds up again. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like kind of emotional drama is beside the point \u2013 kind of free of yourself or feeling angry like this? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Not really because it feels more real or more [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:02).
