It\u2019s not my job. [unclear] My buddy\u2019s health insurance is a PPO.

Because he\u2019d be working for me if he got hired there. It turns out his\u2026 I\u2019m figuring out like what his problem is. Because, you know, he\u2019s looking to get back into therapy because his fianc\u00e9 left him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

He\u2019s like, you know, \u201cI do ice hockey, that\u2019s all my exercise, but I\u2019m too competitive to enjoy it.\u201d So I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">like, \u201cWell, yeah, okay. Good call on reaching out to everybody though.\u201d You know. He goes, he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know a good therapist,\u201d asking for a friend. So I engaged him with, \u201cOkay. Well, I could find some resources for your friend, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like.\u201d You know, after a while we dropped <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">the friend pretense, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And is he in Georgetown?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: He works at a place with flexible hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Speaking of which, I had an interview.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it went really well. They were gonna talk about me Wednesday morning stand up, but I\u2019m not sure how many made it into the office yesterday. Considering that I\u2019m pretty flexible, work from home policy, you know, when shit goes wrong\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: So the latest, they\u2019ll be speaking today about me. But they made a couple of Freudian slips during the interview process. You know, sort of stuff like about, \u201cWell, when you do this, and when you do this, then we\u2019ll need you to do this.\u201d The sort of stuff they talk about as if you already have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">the job, you know. So like the inclination is to hire me. The CEO told me, he\u2019s like, \u201cJust keep in mind that all salaries over $100,000 have to go past the board.\u201d And I\u2019m like cool about it. So they do compensation at a balance of salary versus stock. And so maybe I can game it into like $100,000, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F2\">and then the rest in stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: What did you think about their stock?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563355\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well, I asked them.

Why would I take stock if you don\u2019t want to sell the company?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a good question.\u201d He\u2019s a coke head, so he\u2019s like, \u201cIf the right place <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">came by and wanted to buy us, I\u2019d sell immediately.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cAt the same time, maybe that never comes along, and we\u2019re doing really well, and all of a sudden your stock is not worth as much. And then we institute a bonus structure based on how much stock you took. So if you took a bunch of stock, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">it\u2019d be a much bigger bonus.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOr maybe we get to the point we\u2019re like, you know, we\u2019re doing so well, we go to the board and like, let\u2019s just start doing dividends off stock shares.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cSo, I mean, we\u2019ll find a way to make the stock valuable, regardless of what we do.\u201d So I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">\u201cOkay.\u201d [0:04:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: This was the guy that you didn\u2019t know, you knew from your friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Right, but I met him through friends. He got to interview with a guy I used to work with, so it was fun. And like the guy who I would be the boss of is already working there. He always thought I was a good boss. He goes, I\u2019m a god damn good boss. And one of the engineers is a guy I worked with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">for years as well, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: He was another guy that you worked with you were the boss of, or he worked with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: He was a coder, so I worked with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s all fun. So the chances are good. If they decide to move forward they\u2019re going to ask me back for a Friday game night, and play some co-op games, they\u2019ll see how I interact socially.

That\u2019s an option too, is like we need to talk about flexibility. You know, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve got this college course I\u2019m taking, it\u2019s a few hours a week and I have to be there during working hours once a week. And as a guess, not an issue. And I was like, \u201cAlso I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">be totally up front with you, there may be days where suddenly I can\u2019t come in.\u201d I said, \u201cHowever, this has never affected my work, I\u2019ve always gotten everything done.

I mean, you have to. You have to do that. You\u2019re not legally allowed to, but you have to kind of thing. You can\u2019t look at someone\u2026 well, he can\u2019t see my Facebook anyways, it\u2019s only set to the super private, so. Still, but my blog is out there, you know, and there\u2019s no secret that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">exists, and stuff like that. Yeah, so you know, whatever. No more filter.

I\u2019ll do something up <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">there. I\u2019ll play Minecraft and\u2026 There is some updated Minecraft [unclear], and there\u2019s three new types of stone that you can use to build, you know, more variations into the world, different colors and textures.

I\u2019m glad we did this, this is a good thing. At the same time I knew, like these <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">chemicals only last so long. Like I\u2019m gonna run out of them.

I would hire one more immediately and see how that went, and then we would scale up from there.

Amazon sends basically everything through them. Especially if they have Amazon Prime, which I do, because it\u2019s stupid not to have it. Well, I should say not stupid. I should say, this fucking scarf leaves threads in my mouth. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202151\">not stupid so much as\u2026 it\u2019s inefficient. I mean, if you buy things, why are you going to a store unless you need it exactly that day? Right? Amazon Prime is $80 a year, you get a bunch of free TV, it streams. You know, you get money off on those things you want, and you get free two day shipping. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202152\">great. Like that battle wagon I want, $80 in the store, $60 online if I wait two days for it. Sometimes three if the UPS driver is going to be lazy about it. Then whatever. You know, so why not have it. But they ship everything that\u2019s Prime through UPS. And so, you know, that\u2019s where UPS\u2019s huge amounts <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202153\">of money come from, because they contract with Amazon. What I should be doing is complaining to Amazon. Like, \u201cHey, our local UPS area keeps whining about delivering packages, so it\u2019s really cutting down on our faith in you as a system.\u201d Then let Amazon just thrash on UPS, and be like, \u201cHey, we have <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202154\">complaints of the customer not getting their packages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20217\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.
