I mean, I guess it just kind of makes me angry, you are just going to look I\u2019m doing something wrong or I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">being\u2026 (pause) I don\u2019t know, like clear enough or, or\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Isn\u2019t that what you said, that like it seems to put you really on the defensive, and maybe on other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) And I guess yeah, it just kind of makes me worried and kind of\u2026 (pause) I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just going to wake up with the feeling like the hell with it or something. (pause) I don\u2019t know, maybe my reaction is more extreme than most people, I feel like. A normal feeling or a normal <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">reaction, which I kind of meant, but I don\u2019t know. Yeah, the silence or not a response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m thinking about just like every day in action, to the people who don\u2019t respond or like, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you have both thoughts, I mean both the thought that like hey, this is just me, you know? There are times my reaction is stronger, but other people feel similarly when met with silence or unresponsiveness. And then I think there\u2019s also the kind of critical thought, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">comes from you as well, which is oh my God, there\u2019s something really the matter with me, that I\u2019m reacting this way. (pause) And which, that I think at times is the piece you give to me, and that you may then kind of wrestle with it by saying that you were feeling bad, accepting the idea that there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">something wrong with you or get angry and feel like well, fuck that, towards\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I guess like I just want to be like well, what would the other extreme be like. Everything I say, I don\u2019t know, I have such full conscience in everything I say, nothing anyone does or doesn\u2019t do, doesn\u2019t affect me or, I don\u2019t know, it just has such like conviction or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">I mean, that just sounds absurd. I mean, I know there\u2019s supposed to be like (pause), some awareness or kind of balance of recognizing when I\u2019m supposed to be, you know? Or recognizing that this feeling is or I had this feeling before and I might be overreacting and it will pass or something, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">don\u2019t know. I guess I just don\u2019t know like the solution or what to do or what I\u2019m supposed to kind of think. I don\u2019t know. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So, none of the points of view that you land on seem quite right or to involve the kind of balance that you want and that, I think puts you in a vulnerable position or makes you feel vulnerable. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I am honestly just I\u2019m not even like yeah, I guess I\u2019m just kind of torn in different directions. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m like, I think just like well\u2026 (pause) I don\u2019t know, I think like well, this is the way I am, this is kind of just the way it\u2019s going to be or something, or I don\u2019t want to be, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">you know, not be so sensitive, have more confidence but I don\u2019t know. (pause) I guess you know where it comes from. I guess I could see it like cutting down my anxiety, to work, my worry, but I guess I feel like I\u2019ve tried everything or I\u2019ve tried both and nothing quite sticks or nothing really works.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562056\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">[PAUSE: 00:12:51 to 00:14:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: So, your feelings are like, you have two options. One is to not be so sensitive. You\u2019ve tried that and that doesn\u2019t really work or you can\u2019t bring it about. The other is to sort of just have your reactions, how ever sensitive in your view they may be, and then kind of go from there, and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">doesn\u2019t work either. And it doesn\u2019t look like there could be any other way. (pause) I think there\u2019s also a bit in there about how I don\u2019t kind of get this about your situation, that you know, you\u2019ve tried the two plausible options and they haven\u2019t worked and I haven\u2019t suggested any other options or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">done anything to indicate I think there are other options really. So, in that particular way, I not only don\u2019t seem to have like useful help for this dilemma, but even don\u2019t actually get what the dilemma is like, that you\u2019re stuck in. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Well, I guess I was trying to explain, yeah, just like kind of how I\u2019m viewing this and how like, I just wanted to say I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s not just two options in my mind or I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s how I kind of I don\u2019t know, I guess I go back and forth between or kind of thoughts like that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">about how to kind of deal with it. Yeah, so I think, I don\u2019t know, I just can\u2019t explain. (pause) I guess there\u2019s a part where, that I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s other options, but at this moment, like that\u2019s how I see it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) the way I see it, I mean like part of the way I understand was, the one aspect of it is I think you have a sort of really quite harsh and demanding side, which I think you most often feel very subject to, like you\u2019re kind of on the receiving end of the harshness and the criticism, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">and that I think you also tend to project out really in a way more into the air than into another person exactly. Like a few minutes ago, when you were talking about wondering about, like your response to the silence or lack of feedback, it seems more like (pause) not exactly like you imagine me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">respond harshly, but you sort of feel, in a more kind of diffuse way, like you\u2019re really doing something wrong or really fucking up. So I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019d say, that\u2019s sort of what I have in mind when I say that I think you kind of project it out a little bit. It sort of like gets in the air here <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">more than you sort of actually imagine saying those kinds of things to you, or critical things, whatever. I think it there are other times I think where you own it more and then feel very critical of other people, or very kind of dismissive of like where they\u2019re coming from or how they are about things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200294\">I guess based on, you know, they\u2019re not at times it\u2019s like sort of holding to the same standards around work or having the same approach to doing things. I think you\u2019re generally very careful not to express that to people or to see it as likely your own projection as anything else, but it\u2019s there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200295\">I think it sometimes troubles you. In here, I think this stuff sort of operates kind of intensely and quickly and subtly. It can be a little hard to get a hold of. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562056\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">For example, sort of that first kind of talk about feeling kind of on the defensive, I mean here and elsewhere certainly, but for the moment, if we can focus on here. If I\u2019m not responsive or because of the silence, it makes you feel like you\u2019re doing something wrong, and then sort of you\u2019re quick to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">sort of, I think, turn events and say well but you know hey, like are there other people like that, you know others who react such as me. Maybe some of it is more tense with me but it\u2019s not only me. But then there\u2019s this sort of gap between that sort of sense of yourself as reasonable and kind of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B2\">most other people or like everybody else, and then that other sense of yourself, you know, having been very harshly judged and kind of\u2026 (pause) Sort of like demeaning difference of kind of way, and then it kind of iterates, I think, as we talk, where like then it comes up around not knowing how to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B3\">out of that situation, where either that means you\u2019re stuck and you\u2019re messing up again, because you don\u2019t know how to fix it, or I\u2019m useless because I don\u2019t know how to fix it and I haven\u2019t told you how to fix it or what to do. I think it starts to get a bit more subtle as the question moves from how <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B4\">you feel to what can be done. I think this is the kind of thing that you\u2019re struggling with a lot, I mean both in your life and in ways that it comes up, I think, in here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">I guess I would also add, (pause) well, like the model in my mind for dealing with problems like that, if in fact I\u2019ve sort of described accurately, what you\u2019re struggling with, is or involves identifying the dynamics and dealing with the sort of feelings, anxieties, frustrations, grief, that sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">of fuel the way all that works, which tends to diffuse them some way. So for example, if you can acknowledge, as you did at the beginning of the hour, and as you were thinking about gees, you know, why the hell does the silence make me feel so vulnerable, like I\u2019m doing something wrong, you know, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">can kind of get in there and have some room to think about it. There\u2019s both, sort of the thinking and the co-opting of the thinking by the dynamics themselves, but it puts you a little less under the sway of in that case, just being, just feeling defensive and like you\u2019ve done something wrong. You can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D3\">sort of step back a little bit and say hey, why is this, this hardly makes sense. I mean in a way it does, people are like, and in a way it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on. Being able to sort of identify this kind of harshness that kind of exists out there in the silences or the uncertainty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D4\">about what to do or how to handle things, and that other people certainly struggle with as well, which I think is why it sounds typical for most of us, to want to hear another\u2026 You know, it helps you start to become a bit less at it, sort of gradually less at the mercy of that sort of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well I guess (pause) yeah, like the poem that I kind of see, or there\u2019s this like, my kind of I don\u2019t know, well-being or emotional state is so dependent on, and like involuntarily dependent on feedback or kind of what I decide to do, or that kind of because if I\u2019m not sure and I can\u2019t calm <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">myself unless I ignore it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562056\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think mostly, you have to kind of placate, like comply with and placate this side of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: And you know well enough that you shouldn\u2019t have to, but that doesn\u2019t matter, or it doesn\u2019t get you out of the dilemma. Like you know that you should be able to, let\u2019s say have a slow Saturday morning if you want one, and not get agitated and really down. But it doesn\u2019t work that way. In <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">fact, even if you know that that\u2019s fair and reasonable and other people do it, you have to comply with the sort of stringent demands of this side of yourself, to get up early and get things done and have a plan and get to your to-do list or whatever it is. I think it\u2019s also true of you that you kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200352\">of like being productive and you like getting a lot done. I\u2019m not saying this is just neurotic. I think there\u2019s a part of you that also likes being productive and working hard and all of that. Do you know what I mean? I\u2019m not just assigning all of your interest in doing that and all of your feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200353\">good about doing that, to this kind of harshness that you have, mostly with yourself. But I am saying, I think and I think you\u2019ve said this to me many times, really so far, the only way you have of feeling okay a lot of the time is to comply with and\/or like placate, that side, and kind of do what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200354\">it demands. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Right. The other option is just shutting down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: Sure. (pause) In my mind, a lot of what you and I are doing is I know that you are very clear and it is not good for you to observe the way this operates in your life, you know, the kinds of demands you feel and the strategies that you have for meeting them, you know whether it\u2019s again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">with the weekends or with exercise or at work. I mean, that\u2019s sort of like a regime you\u2019ve been living under for a while. I think, it seems to me, that what you and I are working on is to\u2026 (pause) Sort of more like\u2026 I think to stand back from it a little bit, both as it operates in your life and in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">here and to sort of identify with the parts of it that you actually maybe this is the way to say it. It gets a little fuzzy, I think, how much you agree you should be dealing with things like this and how much you just have to, to maintain, to not shut down and to feel okay. And it seems to me like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200393\">we\u2019re sort of stemming back a little bit from the dynamics and sorting out which of those is which, you know when do you do something because you feel vulnerable and when do you do something because it\u2019s what you want to do or you think you should do it. You know, also I think these sorts of dynamics <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200394\">tend, often very gradually, but distinctly over time, to lose like the tyranny gets looser and the sort of knowledge of how it works and opportunities to be kind of flex or how to deal with things increase, I think often quite gradually, but distinctly, over time. It seems to me that\u2019s what we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200395\">working on. My concern with you is that like there hasn\u2019t been a lot of room and you\u2019re not feeling much more flexible with this stuff than you were a year ago. Maybe you\u2019re kind of more aware of how it operates and in some ways how pervasive it is, but not, it\u2019s not any looser on how to do things in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200396\">order not to sort of shut down or get very anxious or agitated. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562056\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">CLIENT: (very soft voice) I don\u2019t know.

(struggling for words) Like this kind of situation of how do other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">deal, or perhaps need. I don\u2019t know.
