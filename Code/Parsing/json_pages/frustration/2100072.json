But that she also was aware that you both just seemed in an extraordinary amount of pain and were vigilantly scanning each other for confirmation of your worst assumptions about the other \u2013 that you both seemed to be doing that some \u2013 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">that you were hurting a lot, both of you. She was worried about you, too. How are you? How are you feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I guess okay.  One thing Dr. Farrow said a couple of times in a couple of different sessions was that nothing Ivan can do is good enough for me which, I admit, I don\u2019t think feels fair. I am aware that I am critical and harsh and we need to fix that. I\u2019m not quite sure how because I told him, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">on the one hand, the things that I was pointing out were pretty reasonable or pretty . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Legit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. And maybe the things that I honestly feel shouldn\u2019t even need to be addressed, shouldn\u2019t even need to be asked. On the other hand, no matter where he\u2019s at \u2013 working as hard as he can, doesn\u2019t care at all, cares a lot \u2013 no matter where he is, that would probably be hard to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: What would be hard to hear? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Criticisms, negative input, even the most tactful observation of \u201cthis needs to happen.\u201d It seems like there\u2019s a lot I need to do on my end but . . . (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot he needs to do on his end, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. It is what it is and I take what I get. There are some days where he can have it together somewhat or he can even surprise me and (sighs) he can make a basic dinner or something. There are moments when he can really do it and there are other moments when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">he had four things on his to-do list and he didn\u2019t start work until 2:00 and he couldn\u2019t get them done and they could have been done in an hour and he didn\u2019t, so it\u2019s really frustrating.  Ivan is pretty clear, at least, that he does not want the idea of being identified formally as having an attention <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">disorder or anything like that. It is really too upsetting to him, even if it would mean this could give us progress or this could give us somewhere to go with knowing what\u2019s going on with it. He\u2019s not okay with it and that feels personal, but I understand. That\u2019s him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Does he say why he\u2019s not okay with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: (sighs) He would be disappointed in himself. He would be ashamed. It would be a let-down. He really has a huge stigma attached to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: From his family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, but even from me, he thinks. I said that I have friends who have it, even people at school. I really couldn\u2019t think anything less of them. In fact, I felt sympathetic. (sighs)  So I don\u2019t understand. I think that\u2019s him. I think that\u2019s his perception largely. I do hear things from his dad <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">and sometimes from his mom, that if I had ADHD, I wouldn\u2019t want to tell them either, quite frankly. (sighs) So I guess there\u2019s a part that feels like I understand, but there\u2019s another part where I feel like it\u2019s really that he feels ashamed and maybe there may be nothing that I can tell him; telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">him over and over that I\u2019m not ashamed doesn\u2019t change that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah. This is the part that\u2019s his to work on and it\u2019s going to take him time. It sounds like he carries around his parents inside him and what you\u2019re picking up on are their judgments of that kind of thing. It just lives inside him as the reality, as your mother lives inside you and your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">father lives inside you. It\u2019s kind of their reality of the way the world works. This is what happens for all people. It\u2019s the way growing up, the way the world is, it feels like that\u2019s the way the world actually is instead of just the way it was for maybe one or two people<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">BREAK IN TAPE FROM [00:05:06 to 00:06:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: have a chance of it being something palatable for Ivan and I think he feels like if he pushes something too quickly that he loses the traction that he has with him right now, so I think those are the lines along which he\u2019s thinking about it and just trying to pace it, in a way, so he can <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">take it in rather than push it out.  I get that it\u2019s like the pace of this is so slow that it feels impossible inside. How do you just wait and wait and wait?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s actually really uniquely difficult for me or different for me because at home, it\u2019s really hard because, of course, I take it personally. This is my spouse. At home it\u2019s really hard to try to figure out did he not do this \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 because he doesn\u2019t care? Because he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">lazy? Because he really does have legitimate issues prioritizing and managing his time \u2013 really, really big issues there? Or is it because he\u2019s depressed? Or is it because he has ADHD and he really couldn\u2019t focus long enough to close the frig? Or is it because his parents really coddled him and he didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">become independent? Is it as simple as he just needs to learn?  I have all these reasons and most of the time it really feels like it\u2019s my fault. It feels like he doesn\u2019t care enough. He doesn\u2019t love me enough and it, quite honestly, feels horribly like he really married me because he needed a caretaker. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">I think there might be some legitimacy to that because that\u2019s definitely a role his mom takes and it makes sense in some way. I think people, on some level, seek out spouses that repeat a little bit of what they know. He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no. If course I would never do that.\u201d I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a conscious thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: It usually isn\u2019t for people, just as I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t conscious for you when you married him to be thinking about \u201call I deserve is to be in a relationship where someone really isn\u2019t going to be there for me and I\u2019m going to be the one that\u2019s responsible.\u201d Do you know what I mean? That <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">wasn\u2019t in your mind.  It wasn\u2019t like you were saying \u201cI\u2019ll go choose that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: It feels like I don\u2019t know and it feels like if somebody could tell me \u201cdon\u2019t take it personally; he\u2019s struggling with it.\u201d It feels like a repetition even of what happens with my mom. It\u2019s really hard to say, \u201cWow, she\u2019s really depressed. Don\u2019t take it personally. Don\u2019t listen to that comment.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">Don\u2019t get hung up about it because that\u2019s someone really intimately close who really defines a big chunk of who you are and how you see yourself. Maybe it shouldn\u2019t but . . . So that\u2019s where I find myself stuck a lot of the time and, on the one hand, I feel like it\u2019s not my job to motivate him and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">not my job to take care of him; but we consistently find ourselves . . . Ivan says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be taken care of. I don\u2019t need it,\u201d but his actions say very differently. (sighs) It\u2019s been tough and I feel like the couples therapy maybe doesn\u2019t always validate that or take into account that does <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">change the dynamic.  I\u2019m not hung up on it, but I can\u2019t get over the . . . (sighs) Dr. Farrow said a couple of times, and I know I already said this, but nothing is going to be enough for me. And I\u2019m sitting there and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cBut wait a minute. Now he\u2019s working part time, which is great compared <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200334\">to not working, but we\u2019re back at square one.\u201d He\u2019s not applying to jobs or, if he is, he\u2019s not reporting them and it\u2019s been hellish, quite frankly. I mean, it is like I never want to hear the word \u201cjob\u201d again in my life. It is unbearable. It is ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Just so I\u2019m brought up to date, what is going on with the day-to-day right now? He\u2019s working at Subway. It\u2019s part-time? Twenty hours? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: No, up to 30. He should be getting 29\u00bd, which is certainly better than nothing, of course. I don\u2019t mean to diminish. I\u2019ve been very supportive of him working there and it\u2019s great. Just this week he starts being solo manager \u2013 4:30 AM to noon \u2013 which means (chuckling) I end up getting up at 4:30, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">too. He does that three days a week and then 2:00 to 9:30 on Saturdays. So he has whole days where he has nothing and then even if he takes a nap when he gets home, then he has whole . . . So he has a lot of time and he still is struggling with getting his stuff done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Has he been getting up and going to work on time, at least?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. He\u2019s going to work. It seems to be always on time. It\u2019s like ten minutes away. It\u2019s a really short drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: How does he think it\u2019s going so far?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: He seems to describe it as going well, but I did become a little aware of something that I wasn\u2019t aware of because the other week after church I said I hadn\u2019t seen it yet.  I mean I\u2019ve seen Subway, obviously, but I don\u2019t drink coffee or tea or anything like that, so I don\u2019t go and we can\u2019t afford <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">it anyway. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, okay. Why don\u2019t we drive past it?\u201d because it was right there and he had suggested it kind of. So we did. He was like, \u201cWell, do you want to go in?\u201d I was like \u201cuhh\u201d because I hadn\u2019t put any make-up on; I had just gone to church. And I don\u2019t drink any of those beverages. Even <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">the smallest suggestion of not really wanting to go in at that particular moment, he immediately was devastated. It was the end of the world. It was like I had just told him I hated him and never wanted to see him again. It was really severe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: That he was hurt, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. He was really upset and so he insisted and I was like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d We went in and he was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you this drink because I think you should try it.\u201d I was like, \u201cI really don\u2019t . . . It\u2019s not personal. I\u2019ve never drunk coffee or [tea beverages. We\u2019re Catholic.] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">(ph?)\u201d  We did it anyway and I was like what happened there? He was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not very proud of it and I just want you to feel proud of it.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell I\u2019ve been very supportive.\u201d I\u2019m asking about it, I told all my friends, I\u2019m not hiding it, (sighs) but he\u2019s ashamed and he feels really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">horrible about it and really self-conscious. I said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a job. No, it\u2019s not what we hoped hours-wise, but you can feel good about getting it. It seems to be more that he\u2019s . . . I\u2019m not ashamed that he\u2019s working there, of course. This is what makes me maybe not a very good person, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">would be happy if Ivan had a career. I would like that. That\u2019s something I would want.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Why would that make you not a very good person? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Because I shouldn\u2019t \u2013 you know \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t judge and him being like a lawyer or a doctor, that type of a career, that shouldn\u2019t make a difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: I haven\u2019t heard you saying you want him only to be a doctor or a lawyer. You said you wanted him to feel passionately committed to something that interests him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I want it to be an actual career and if that meant baking or being a lawyer or whatever it was . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Or even running a Subway. I know this maybe would take a little bit more to wrap your mind around, but I even think if you knew he loved coffee and had a passion for different kinds of coffee and he wanted to go research coffee of the world and he wanted to help shape Subway \u2013 that this was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">really a passion as opposed to what he\u2019s fallen into because he couldn\u2019t do anything else \u2013 that sounds like the thing that would make you feel happy with him and attracted to him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, that would be very attractive to me because ambition . . . I mean I don\u2019t need him to be power-hungry or rich or anything like that, but motivation and a really strong sense of purpose and energy, I think it ties into the stuff at home. Even doing his two chores, just really being a productive, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">hard-working . . . I think the work ethic is really important to me. I grew up with a dad who has an over-active work ethic. I think it sounds really horrible because I spent my whole life saying how much I hated it, but that\u2019s almost easier to stomach. That\u2019s almost easier to stomach because at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F2\">that\u2019s something you know is not good, but it shows hard work and dedication and years and years and years of working. It\u2019s easier than this, but I can\u2019t say that.  I\u2019ve been using the phrase \u201cget a second part-time job or a better job.\u201d I\u2019ve been using the word \u201cbetter\u201d and by that I meant better hours, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F3\">better pay, maybe even better in terms of using his education. And when he hears that, he hears \u2013 and he let me know after the incident like going \u2013 that that meant that this wasn\u2019t good enough and this wasn\u2019t okay. I have to be really careful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: So he\u2019s also \u2013 it\u2019s interesting, because one of your deepest cares is that it means he doesn\u2019t care about you enough, that he really doesn\u2019t love you. This story screams of him caring extremely so \u2013 what you think about him and what your judgment are of him \u2013 that he\u2019s very sensitive to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t feel that way. I feel that Ivan is hyper-sensitive to the way anyone perceives him. He\u2019s always said he doesn\u2019t care what people think, but I think he\u2019s hyper-sensitive to what his parents think, what I think, that he really attaches his value and his self-esteem and so many things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">even how he can react to other people.  He attaches it to how they treat him and how they view him and I don\u2019t that has much to do with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">THERAPIST: You feel this isn\u2019t unique to you, caring about your opinion?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">CLIENT: No. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">THERAPIST: That he\u2019s just sensitive to everyone\u2019s judgments around him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I guess it sounds like he has some harsh internal judgment, but it\u2019s very rare that he will say that he really needs to get working on the second job. He will say that sometimes, but then I\u2019ll say \u201cSo did you do that?\u201d or \u201cDid you follow up?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d So we\u2019re back at square <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">one, it feels like a little bit and I can\u2019t get upset about it.  (chuckles) I\u2019m really embarrassed. After I left here crying the other week, I had to realize that I had to pull it together because I wasn\u2019t going to \u2013 I just had to. Nobody was going to . . . You know. I needed to do that, so I\u2019ve been <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B2\">working a lot. (chuckles) A lot a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Working meaning at school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: At school and I\u2019ve also been working on this research project so I\u2019ve even volunteered for extra stuff and I\u2019ve worked on so many things over spring break. I did all our taxes. We already got our refund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: Wow. Oh, my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: Really. Yeah. There were a bunch of things on the to-do list that . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: You just started ticking off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. I made a huge list on spring break and just . . . Yeah. (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: It makes me wonder what it was like when you say nobody is going to kind of be able to run in and you didn\u2019t really even finish your sentence. I don\u2019t know how you were going to complete the sentence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s weird because I think I\u2019m pretty good at taking care of myself, but in that way I felt devastated like nobody is going to take care of me if I cry. It just is. Again, I guess I feel a little tense because in couples counseling the Dr. Farrow said, \u201cYou\u2019re critical of him because he\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">handing you a tissue because you\u2019re crying.\u201d And I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair.\u201d I don\u2019t mean it in a critical way \u2013 I guess I do mean it in a critical way, but I also mean that I really just want compassion and common effort and it\u2019s been hard for Ivan. He has been frequently doing the thing where <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B2\">he won\u2019t show any emotion in his face and I asked him what that was about because it\u2019s really off-putting to have someone approach you when you\u2019re sobbing with no emotion and just \u201cwhat can I do?\u201d  He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to show any emotion because I don\u2019t want you to think that I\u2019m manipulating <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B3\">you,\u201d because I brought up that sometimes if I try to go away, it feels very manipulative, which is a word that Dr. Farrow said not to use; but that\u2019s how it feels. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re caught between a rock and a hard place. It\u2019s just seems like everything you say to him is like being trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: It does, and especially from my perspective nothing he does is good enough. It feels unfair, but it also feels like maybe nobody gets it. I\u2019m the only one there and I\u2019m the only one actually dealing with it all the time because his parents have made it clear. They do sometimes and not at other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">times. I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s been like \u201clet\u2019s get you help\u201d or \u201cit is okay if you have ADHD\u201d or \u201cI won\u2019t think any less of you.\u201d I\u2019m the only one saying \u201cit\u2019s so great that you are starting to run the Subway this week.\u201d  I guess I don\u2019t get credit for all of that and Ivan certainly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">that he doesn\u2019t feel appreciative, but he just doesn\u2019t hear it. If he looks back on the week and we try to talk about what was positive, he doesn\u2019t hear it \u2013 which I understand because I\u2019ve been, and I guess I am, depressed and it\u2019s really easy to filter out that stuff because that\u2019s kind of how it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: But you are saying those things you say to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re saying positive things to him and maybe he just can\u2019t take those in as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like it\u2019s really fair, but I feel like I\u2019m back to negotiating. Yesterday I asked him if he could help out with the apartment because I generally try and clean it once a week.  I usually won\u2019t ask him to help or I\u2019ll ask him to do like the bathroom and I\u2019ll do the rest, something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">like that; but this week I had a big draft due on Thursday and was putting in extra hours on the research and all this stuff. I\u2019ve just been really, really working all day long so I sort of asked him that and I could tell it wasn\u2019t okay so I kept reducing what I asked him to do and it turned into \u201cif <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200772\">you could run the vacuum and wipe off the counters.\u201d It really went down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t feel good either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: No. This is a tactic I\u2019ve done at home a million times because it\u2019s better to get something than nothing. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Oh, Ramona. What I left feeling last time we met and I thought about for quite some time, is just how alone it sounded like you were feeling with all of this. It was like really nobody was understanding what this was like for you and, in a way, you aren\u2019t hearing enough validation about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">things that legitimately extremely concerning in him. Those things are real and I hear you saying you keep hearing how you\u2019re too critical from Dr. Farrow, for example, but there\u2019s not a lot of space to say yes, you might lead with criticism in who you are. That doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t real things <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">happening that are actually there to be critical of. Do you know what I mean? Those are separate things and I think they\u2019re both true. What you\u2019re describing in him, even just the difficulty having a straight-forward conversation about anything, how everything gets sort of turned inside out or \u201cI don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D3\">want to express emotion because you\u2019ll tell me I\u2019m manipulative,\u201d there\u2019s no way of actually having normal contact and conversation and communication about something that involves feelings.  It\u2019s leaving you feeling unbelievably trapped and like you\u2019re living out your childhood all over again and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D4\">taking you totally by surprise that this is where you find yourself. It\u2019s also horrifying to feel like is the answer going to be that you just have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and take care of things again, when you\u2019ve done that your entire childhood when you should not have been doing that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D5\">when other people should have been taking care of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">It\u2019s horrifying to find yourself now as an adult in this place where actually there aren\u2019t adults in your life anymore who are going to be the parents who are going to take care of you. You missed that part. You missed out on what you should have been getting from 0 to 20.  And to find that you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">get that anywhere now, it just sounds so terribly, terribly, terribly lonely for you. I hear you retreating back to a place which, I think in some ways, is adaptive. This is what you\u2019ve done your whole life is just \u201cokay, I\u2019m going to take care of things.\u201d I think that\u2019s a strength of yours. Another <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F2\">person would have floundered and become a drug addict.

You have had an incredibly adaptive pathway that you found not because of what your parents had done for you, but in spite of it simply because of who you are. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200831\">re-finding again in these two weeks; \u201cwhat do I do when the going gets tough?\u201d  What you did was you organized. You found motivation again. You made a list. You accomplished<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">BREAK IN TAPE FROM [00:26:04 to 00:27:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: I have a genuine concern. I use the word manipulative to describe with the suicidality, with anytime I leave, or even the sort of self-deprecating remarks where he really looks for me to say \u201cno, no,\u201d to really reaffirm. You\u2019ve described it as an attachment or a personality disorder and I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">don\u2019t understand that, not that you haven\u2019t tried to explain it, but I just don\u2019t.  I don\u2019t get what that really means globally, but I wonder if it isn\u2019t emotionally abusive and I feel horrible saying that because that makes him \u2013 the word they use is batterer \u2013 and my husband is not a batterer in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200872\">eyes. But I guess something they teach us in school is if you\u2019re in an emotionally-abusive relationship, counseling is not the way to go. It\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s not appropriate for any abusive relationship and forgiving it over and over is also not a solution. (sighs) So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200873\">this is going to sound bizarre, but when med students start going to school and they think they have everything under the sun. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening because I\u2019m taking this course on partner violence and I\u2019m doing this research related to partner violence, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200874\">reading this and thinking \u201che matches all of these.\u201d  I\u2019m seeing two therapists and I\u2019m waiting for somebody to say this is or is not an emotionally-abusive relationship or that he does or does not have ADHD or what the heck is going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: What do you think it would do to hear that it is or it isn\u2019t? What if you say it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: In my eyes, the only acceptable reasons to get a divorce are physical abuse, sexual abuse or adultery. Those are pretty much the big, main \u2013 I guess if there was something else like they decided they didn\u2019t want to have children after all or they converted to a different religion or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">really drastic, emotional abuse is pretty subtle, I think, from what I understand. I feel like I witnessed a lot of that with my parents, though I didn\u2019t label it that growing up. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">THERAPIST: So it wouldn\u2019t change anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">CLIENT: I think it might, but I think I would not feel validated in telling people \u201cI\u2019m in an emotionally abusive relationship,\u201d because that sounds like you argue. I wouldn\u2019t say this to someone else, but for me it sounds like you argue or \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You can\u2019t be sympathetic? He\u2019s struggling <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F1\">with mental illness. What\u2019s wrong with you? He can\u2019t help it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if you were looking for an answer to that question. Would that be helpful? You might not be satisfied with my answer, though, because to me it\u2019s not something that is black and white in that I would say what he does is \u2013 manipulation is a word I use even with you colloquially. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">It captures it.  My guess is the reason Dr. Farrow has asked you not to use that word is that usually when people hear that word about themselves, it doesn\u2019t go anywhere because it\u2019s really, really thought of as a pejorative thing to say to another person. I even don\u2019t usually use that if I thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200912\">you were manipulative. I wouldn\u2019t use that word because I think people just sort of cringe at the word and it actually doesn\u2019t get at the heart of what\u2019s going on underneath it, which is something more along the lines of feeling incredibly desperate. Often not to be abandoned or left alone because of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200913\">a tremendous amount of anxiety, a tremendous amount of self-loathing, a tremendous amount of shame, you at least often feel safe or better about yourself if there\u2019s someone there kind of keeping you company in the world.  This is in the range of personality and attachment related themes, which also <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200914\">is a kind of gray area to say to you because it\u2019s not a cut and dried diagnosis in a box. It\u2019s in the spectrum of sense of self and sense of self in relation to other people, so he does not sound like he feels securely good about who he is at all \u2013 and that\u2019s not rocket science. You know that. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200915\">he feels terrified that even a brief separation is going to be the beginning of the end, that there\u2019s some big abandonment that hangs over that. That probably has nothing to do with you. You\u2019re right. In other words, it has to do with something probably early in his own childhood that has nothing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200916\">do with the reality of your current adult relationship. He\u2019s living out something in the past when he says that and I think when he\u2019s in this desperate place, he wants to do or say anything to get you to stay because he\u2019s terrified what will happen if he\u2019s left alone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">BREAK IN TAPE FROM [00:33:02 to 00:34:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">THERAPIST: He doesn\u2019t experience it that way. It sounds like he\u2019s experiencing it as a confirmation that he\u2019s a worthless person somehow, that that\u2019s what it would actually mean; so he retreats and you\u2019re left holding the bag about the shame and criticism because there\u2019s so much he has that he can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200951\">even speak to it. I think if he were to start saying, \u201cI really screwed that up and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d and not have it be so heavy in the room, you\u2019d say, \u201cThank goodness. He\u2019s taking ownership. He\u2019s starting to get it. He\u2019s making some movements.\u201d But he has so much right now that he literally can\u2019t function <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200952\">sometimes in a relationship and his own life around it.  Again, this is an ambiguous and vague description that, I think, is going to leave you feeling not satisfied that it\u2019s a specific thing or not. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">CLIENT: I do. I\u2019m trying to decide what I need to be doing is even, as a Christian, as a person, is to respond with compassion and get him the help he needs and be really patient and work it through with him \u2013 or if I need to take a step back and say, \u201cWait a minute. I don\u2019t need to be ashamed that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200971\">he\u2019s doing some of these things. It\u2019s not my fault. I am actually the recipient of it and maybe I need to get help and maybe even need to get out of it if he\u2019s not able to change it.\u201d Because quite frankly if I told my friends my husband threatens to kill himself if I go away, they would probably say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200972\">\u201cSomething is not okay, Ramona. This isn\u2019t a little marital squabble. That\u2019s not okay. You can\u2019t sweep that under the rug.\u201d  I\u2019m really stuck between the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So what if I was to say that I think the healthiest, wholest response actually includes both of those? I think if you lean only in the vein of \u201cI\u2019m going to be supportive. I\u2019m going to be understanding. He\u2019s having such a hard time,\u201d that ignores the reality that he\u2019s an adult in an <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200991\">adult world married to an adult and has adult responsibilities that are actually there right now. That\u2019s sort of like making yourself be a mother of a very sick six-year-old boy or something again. That\u2019s not real and I think, pretty quickly, you will resent that. You might be able to put on those clothes <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200992\">for a month and pretend to not have a self or to not have feelings about this for a little while, but I don\u2019t think that would last. That\u2019s just not how people work. You\u2019re a person who is important in this relationship \u2013 as important as he is. It is not a mother\/child relationship.  It is an adult\/adult <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200993\">relationship. That\u2019s the reality. That said, I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s only that he\u2019s all evil, all bad, not making any progress that, if you got rid of him, your pain would all go away. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B\">CLIENT: No. No. I do know what you mean. In fact, I think if I had a way to separate myself from even my parents and that past and from Ivan, I think there would be residuals. I get that, so I feel stuck because, I guess between those two things, in one instance I have hope that he can get help. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B1\">can get over this. We can move forward and it\u2019s not going to keep happening. But on the other, it\u2019s a cycle that\u2019s going to keep happening over and over, sort of like it has with my parents \u2013 not in the same way.  I\u2019m 24 and it sounds really selfish, but I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my 20\u2019s taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B2\">care of him. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t love him and want to take . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Ramona, I\u2019m totally with you. I hear you. Look, I was the one that first brought up the \u201cD\u201d word and you looked at me horrified, like how is that even possible that that was crossing my mind. This is, to me, where you\u2019re actually trying to look at whether there are changes that are happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D1\">that feel like they\u2019re valid and they\u2019re real and you can begin to trust small changes, that give you a sense that it\u2019s worth being patient for a longer period of time because you see some things starting to move. Even if he\u2019s with you and he\u2019s saying \u201cshe\u2019s critical of me all the time\u201d from his end, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D2\">you could say the same thing to him. Is she working on complementing things you do well? Is she working on biting her tongue sometimes and just letting you flounder a little bit and not trying to be your mother so much?  So he could be assessing some of that about what works for him. From your end, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D3\">that\u2019s kind of how I would see it right now. If this is the way it stays, you sound incredibly unhappy in this relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F\">CLIENT: Not all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Not all the time, but a lot of the time. I think if it stayed this way and it didn\u2019t move and it\u2019s two years later and we\u2019re sitting here having the same conversation, it\u2019s not enough for you. That\u2019s at least what I\u2019m hearing you say. You can\u2019t live with this the way it is right now forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A3\">CLIENT: That\u2019s very true, but I can\u2019t even wrap my head around what I would need in myself and from I-don\u2019t-know-who to be able to do something like that because . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So maybe that\u2019s part of the fantasy for a second of \u201cgosh, if someone were to tell me this is an abusive relationship. . .\u201d maybe that would somehow give you permission to not be in it anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A7\">CLIENT: Right. Actually we had \u2013 this is going to sound kind of silly, but we have guest speakers in this course. She\u2019s an expert. My professor is an expert in the field and she\u2019s really awesome. We had a guest speaker who is actually a pastor and her organization coordinates faith communities with <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A71\">service providers like psychologists and police and a wide span. That\u2019s their job because there isn\u2019t a resource for that directly in the church. She talked about how she went through this and how divorce was unthinkable and how it was really emotionally abusive and she said she hears key things like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A72\">\u201che\u2019s like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\u201d or \u201che\u2019s like a different person\u201d or you feel like you\u2019re walking on eggshells. I\u2019m sitting there thinking, \u201cThat\u2019s how it feels sometimes,\u201d and I don\u2019t want to tell anyone that, but that\u2019s how it feels sometimes. She said that she got a response from her priest at <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A73\">the time that it wasn\u2019t acceptable to get divorced. She got through it and she got divorced and she was okay and she found a way to deal with women who struggle with those types of issues.  I had this fantasy of talking to her almost, which is so silly, but I thought I don\u2019t want to make a mountain <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A74\">out of a molehill because it\u2019s not every day and it\u2019s not all of our relationship, but what if a lot of this really isn\u2019t okay and really isn\u2019t something that can change or will?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not okay, just so you know that I\u2019m clear about what you\u2019re tolerating. If it doesn\u2019t change, it really does not sound like it\u2019s working for you and it\u2019s hurting you. I think your question that you\u2019re grappling with is how much is it changing for real and how much isn\u2019t it? How long <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A91\">a period of time are you willing and wanting to wait to see if it does make some changes? I\u2019m just aware of our time. We\u2019ve got to stop, but to be continued, okay? Next week then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And let me know if you ever want to find a second time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I know you\u2019re super busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B3\">CLIENT: Do you do extended session or no?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100072\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I can, but we would have to find a time that works because right now I have a session on either side of our time, and then in terms of reimbursement we would have to talk about how that would all work, if that\u2019s workable for you or not.
