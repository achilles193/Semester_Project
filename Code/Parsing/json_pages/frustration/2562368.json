(laughs) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">CLIENT: Part of it is that Ashley believes very strongly and is very vocal about expressing his belief that everyone is a true thing but everyone has something creative to contribute to the world and that was therapeutic in some ways to be exposed to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">Part of it was just how easily physical affection came to him. Not just that the sex was good, it was, but like just casual affection whenever we were hanging out together which is something that my other partners were very bad at. Like, Dave doesn\u2019t really touch me unless we are actively engaged in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB1\">foreplay or sex. Like, he doesn\u2019t brush his hand against my shoulder while we\u2019re cooking together or you know, lean over and kiss me when we\u2019re sitting side by side on the couch reading our laptops for no reason other than because he can. Right? And that\u2019s I didn\u2019t realize that was something I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB2\">wanted and was missing in my relationships until I had it and then I didn\u2019t anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562368\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(pause) Dave\u2019s approach <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">to the world is very adversarial. He notices things in order to either critique or praise them but everything has a value judgment where Ashley is reluctant to make value judgments to a fault I think but he takes it way too far in the other direction but Yeah.

You were not telling me that earlier and more practically that these are things you really like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">CLIENT: Mhm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">THERAPIST: About him or have been missing about him? And (pause) there was another thing. (pause) It might have been Well, and how much you\u2019re missing him and missing those things (inaudible at 00:28:32).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">00:29:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Maybe something like it\u2019s very hard for you to hold onto those things in yourself without having them confuse someone else.

I mean, I understand you\u2019re saying this is why you\u2019re missing Ashley so in that way you are remembering them and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: knowing that they must matter a lot to you but at the same time you\u2019re so angry at yourself -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: Mhm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: But I think that probably blocks it out.
