But yeah \u2013 so many things \u2013 I guess things are starting to \u2013 like I\u2019m starting to think about things like recently \u2013 like I know it was a big deal for Jeremy and I to come to an understanding that I would pack my own lunches, and I would have a half cup of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">at this time and at that time. So you know, he\u2019s come to accept the Cinnamon Toast Crunch but you know it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 a lot of times during the day he\u2019ll interject, \u2018Oh, you should drink more water.

I mean, I can say, \u2018No,\u2019 and I do have certain weaknesses, but at that point, that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve started feeling like this is what my body needed. Or at least this is what I needed \u2013 I mean, for some reason \u2013 I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">back during my really skinny days like, you know, there were certain rewards that I gave myself, like cereal, because I would eat \u2013 be very good, I would eat very low \u2013 low calories, not very caloric foods, but this was kind of like a free food for me. But you know, recently, as I started exercising <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">and I just found myself like really hungry. Like today I was \u2013 for the past few days like I\u2019ve been eating salads for lunch and just craving vegetables and not \u2013 you know, nothing \u2013 craving actual real food. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And it kind of sort like made sense to me sort of \u2013 because last night I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I have dance class late at night, like 7:30 to 9:00. And it\u2019s really hard to fit in like, \u2018Do I eat dinner before,\u2019 but then I\u2019ll feel like too full and sleepy to move. But if I don\u2019t eat anything then I\u2019ll be <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">hungry,\u2019 so I try and split it up, but I mean, I was just really hungry last night, and I was like, \u2018You know, I\u2019m trying to\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t want to gain weight and just eat because you know I\u2019m really, really \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: \u2013 I mean, I didn\u2019t know if I was real hungry or not, but I just couldn\u2019t get to sleep. So I ate, you know, just some yogurt and cooked up squash in the fridge. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it was that point \u2013 it\u2019s funny when these things come to me, but I was just thinking like, you know, \u2018I could eat cereal, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">there\u2019s chocolate, there\u2019s \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: \u2013 peanut butter in the pantry.\u2019 But I\u2019m feeling like I \u2013 you know, I\u2019m really hungry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: And I want \u2013 you know, I feel like \u2013 but I felt this sort of need, like my body wanted like food \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098448\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: \u2013 not nibbles and \u2013 and you know, today for lunch I sort of had this sort of feeling or like, over the past week, I\u2019ve had this for like an actual lunch, rather than like yogurt and bread, which in many standards is like we eat that for breakfast \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: \u2013 but having that two times a day like it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it \u2013 it \u2013 it\u2019s not what my body feels like it needs any more.

And he\u2019s told me that. You know, controlling when I eat, but I \u2013 you know, today I told him that I was having a chick pea salad, and he was really happy. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">I sort of found like those ways to sort of express myself and have my own control \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: \u2013 but also sort of be healthy and not just do things to \u2013 you know, just sort of really think about, \u2018What does my body need?\u2019 And I know sometimes when someone tells me, \u2018No,\u2019 I \u2013 very often \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: \u2013 it\u2019s like that\u2019s \u2013 \u2018Gosh darn it, I\u2019m going to eat that Tootsie Pop if you tell me no.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: And for the first time in like \u2013 in a \u2013 I mean \u2013 and a lot of times, my eating was so much interwoven with the magic, the sort of rituals that I had when I was really, really thin. Like a Tootsie Pop would be to prolong the sort of feeling of hunger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: And \u2013 and now like, rather than having a Tootsie Pop, I just, you know, had an apple and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: \u2013 and be done with it.

I love to do that. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">I sort of realized that, you know, maybe I\u2019m starting to feel a little bit guilty about \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: \u2013 and trying to reign it in a little bit.

So he thinks they\u2019re tasty. But, you know, it\u2019s or more less I feel in control of that, and in spending, I\u2019m all in control. We sort of have an understanding of how much I give <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">him every month \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: \u2013 and so in that sense, I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve been in control, but I\u2019ve also been out of control, and that\u2019s \u2013 is like \u2013 there\u2019s things like \u2013 I have a moral conscious and I sort of realized that, you know, in the same sense I have to pay taxes and \u2013 but we also have to save up as a couple, and I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">\u2013 like he does a lot of things for me.

I mean, unless I was tired or being lazy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">But then I sort of realized like, \u2018Oh, I need to spend time with Jeremy.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: And I \u2013 I sort of feel like I go on these little \u2013 like these spurts where all I want to do is this one thing, and for a big part of our relationship, my big one thing was Jeremy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: And you know, this whole like I want to \u2013 we weren\u2019t living together, but I was commuting all the way and I couldn\u2019t get much work done, I couldn\u2019t do dance, and \u2013 I mean, but it was all for Jeremy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: And you know, in one sense, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s no, you know, not fair or \u2013 for me.
