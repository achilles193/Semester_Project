So I also recognize that underneath that, you know there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s some emotion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: If you could put a name to the emotion, what would it be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: (sigh) hum, hum, hum, hum \u2013 I would probably say sadness.

I think that some of what we talked about last week, I think in terms of \u2013 hum \u2013 (pause) you know trying to categorize or trying to describe you know, who I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: You know the type of personality that I think that I am. You know somebody who feels passionate, likes to be \u2013 would like to be perhaps in a relationship where it felt that kind of energy, you know and it\u2019s just like wow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: You know? It\u2019s like sort of that sense of being like well, sort of feel stuck with the way the situation is right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Obviously not being able to see the clear direction out of the quicksand, but just sort of like, I don\u2019t know if quicksand is necessarily the right word. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: You know it\u2019s more of a sense of like hum, kind of stuck, I\u2019m not sure which way to go or how to get out of this. So yeah, and just feeling sad that it\u2019s like hum. Yeah. Or \u2013 yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: What would it be like if you let yourself feel sad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well I think that I have.

I don\u2019t not \u2013 yeah, I \u2013 I guess. I \u2013 I think more that I\u2019ve kind of gotten to a place of recognizing that (sigh) you know, sad\u2019s the story here. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561252\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like who says it\u2019s sad, you know. I \u2013 there are days when I \u2013 when I can \u2013 I can sit back and I can go oh, well this isn\u2019t sad at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: This is a tremendously liberating place to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Which part of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I mean being in a relationship where you know, you don\u2019t have maybe that \u2013 that \u2013 those you know and look at other relationships and it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s like wow, there\u2019s a lot of expectations and you know, people have a little bit tighter sense of like what the rules are or what the norms are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">in the relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m like wow. You know things are really you know, pretty loose here, so it\u2019s like shouldn\u2019t really feel like that\u2019s a bad thing you know. (chuckle) So it\u2019s kind of like I can look at the conditions maybe from a place of you know, being objective about it a little bit and recognizing well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">if I go down this road and I \u2013 if I go with this interpretation, I can go hum, this is sad. Or if I go down this road it\u2019s like, you know, this is kind of good. (laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Well \u2013 yeah, so I definitely hear what you\u2019re saying. I guess the pattern that makes me feel sad is the fact that you have to for so much of your life from what you\u2019ve told me, continue to minimize your own feelings because people have not really let you feel them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: So now you\u2019re in a pattern where you yourself have to say well, it\u2019s not sad. But it\u2019s deeply sad because it\u2019s not what you wanted it to be. I mean and sometimes you have to grieve what you wanted it to be, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: It \u2013 you know you say well it doesn\u2019t change it. Well, no it doesn\u2019t change it, but it distracting yourself from it, is sometimes a good strategy, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s there. And when you look back over a lifetime with someone, and it didn\u2019t turn out at all what you wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">it to be, that\u2019s deeply sad and very angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: And the fact that you \u2013 you know, based on you know your belief system and value system you know, I don\u2019t know who wouldn\u2019t feel stuck. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Because from the outside looking in you say well, you know we don\u2019t fight and you know she doesn\u2019t put these restrictions on me. But sometimes you would want a fight and some restrictions versus a lack of emotional intimacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah I suppose that you know if the \u2013 yeah I don\u2019t know. Hum, it \u2013 that\u2019d be an interesting question to sit with, but I think \u2013 yeah. Emotional intimacy it\u2019s like well, it\u2019s been out of the picture for such a long time, it\u2019s difficult to even you know, kind of put myself there you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">So yeah, you know, feeling that sadness and you sort of you know, it\u2019s like the \u2013 you know the situation being what it is and it\u2019s like (sigh) how do you find \u2013 how do you find emotional intimacy? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: You know in the current set \u2013 (chuckle) you know in the set up that we have.

Just \u2013 yeah, I was swallowing a lot of anger, you know and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20259\">THERAPIST: Why swallow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025B\">CLIENT: (sigh) I don\u2019t know, I think I just got \u2013 I got to this place that just like \u2013 well I think it was also on you know, coming to the place or coming on the heels of that we had that conversation once like you know what \u2013 what the \u2013 in relationship to the sex abuse scandal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like you know, after one of those weekends where we had been together, you know it was kind of clearly we were \u2013 you know that sexual relations had come down to like four times out of the year. And like these were important weekends because this was the only time that we \u2013 we did, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2025F1\">know we had the time or the space for this kind of relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20261\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20263\">CLIENT: And it was after one of those weekends, she\u2019s like I just don\u2019t think that we can do this right now. I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t go there right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20265\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20267\">CLIENT: So I mean really that was about the extent of the conversation, I\u2019m like \u2013 you know so it was like I could see that it was like \u2013 I\u2019m going to use a Star Trek analogy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20269\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2026B\">CLIENT: Because I don\u2019t know it\u2019s like \u2013 lowered the force field long enough to be able to tell you that piece of information. And then the force field went back up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2026D\">THERAPIST: To not be able to have a conversation about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2026F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s what it felt like on the inside you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20271\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20273\">CLIENT: And you know I played that game. It\u2019s like instead of me being you know, self-confident enough or self-assertive enough, or caring enough about you know, how do I make this \u2013 you know, it\u2019s like well okay. I just kind of sat with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20275\">THERAPIST: But you do deeply care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20277\">CLIENT: I do. And you know \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20279\">THERAPIST: I mean you\u2019re not \u2013 you\u2019re not apathetic at all. There\u2019s no \u2013 this is not apathetic. This is not apathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2027B\">CLIENT: (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2027D\">THERAPIST: But there is anger and pain, it\u2019s not apathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2027F\">CLIENT: Well yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20281\">THERAPIST: I mean so I guess a question comes to mind, if it could be, if you thought that there was a chance to have a friendship and an emotional and sexual relationship with you wife, would you want to have that with her? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20283\">CLIENT: (sigh) You know I guess part of the \u2013 I (pause) I think \u2013 I think yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20285\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20287\">CLIENT: I mean to really be honest with you about it, I\u2019m not 100 percent sure I can say yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20289\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2028B\">CLIENT: I mean there\u2019s \u2013 I, it\u2019s like shit. There\u2019s a lot \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of damage (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2028D\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot of damage, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2028F\">CLIENT: There\u2019s a lot of damage, there\u2019s a lot of crap here that has to be cleaned up before, and like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20291\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20293\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I don\u2019t \u2013 I recognize that it\u2019s conditional. You know it\u2019s like well yes, but I think for me the biggest piece is right now, it\u2019s like I really had the feeling like this is somebody who really isn\u2019t looking for my affection right now. And I\u2019m like well the last thing that I want is <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202931\">to be the guy that\u2019s in the position of like trying to make you like me. (laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20292-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20292-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561252\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20295\">THERAPIST: Sure. You know, and you \u2013 you laugh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20297\">CLIENT: I\u2019m like well that really sucks. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20299\">THERAPIST: Well you laugh but it\u2019s such a \u2013 it\u2019s a painful thing and I get that, right. But, you know I\u2019m thinking a couple of things. You know I\u2019m imaging there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s like you\u2019re screaming from the inside. But if you, you know \u2013 so you know because you \u2013 it\u2019s like being imprisoned. You know you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202991\">mention the analogy of a force field, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029D\">THERAPIST: And so I almost wonder, and I am certainly not suggesting this at all. But you know I almost wonder what do you have to lose by saying look, I\u2019m not happy. This is not what I \u2013 I am struggling every day because this looks like none of what I wanted it to. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029F\">And there are times I want to emotionally connect to you and we are living these separate lives where we completely freeze each other out. I mean we just live a mockery of what we started out doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A1\">CLIENT: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A3\">THERAPIST: You know I mean, as scary as that would be, you know you would at least get to release some of that and see what happens. Now, of course you say that then there has to \u2013 then either nothing happens which is bad, something happens which is scary, I mean, but what would it be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A5\">CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A7\">THERAPIST: To crack the force field enough to state your own truth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A9\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah I think I recognize you know, I think I recognize enough to know that yeah. If you ever really want to crake this, you\u2019re going to have to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That\u2019s what I mean about screaming from the inside. It\u2019s such a silent scream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I recognize that yeah. It\u2019s one of the big \u2013 it\u2019s one of the big dragons. It\u2019s one of the \u2013 it\u2019s like okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AF\">THERAPIST: But Seamus you\u2019ve been silent for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B1\">CLIENT: Yeah I know, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B3\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s killing you emotionally. I mean that\u2019s the \u2013 I mean that\u2019s the most painful piece that it\u2019s killing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like a thousand cuts on the inside, right? And so you know, my guess is you do find comfort in meditation. And you do find comfort in Taoism. But your voice is still \u2013 I mean you have had this whole culture your whole life of being silenced. Allowing yourself to be silenced or being <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202B71\">silenced. Not giving your own emotion weight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B9\">CLIENT: Hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202BB\">THERAPIST: And so in some ways it gives other people permission to not give it weight. But it is equally important as everyone else is. You know and at least if you state your truth, and maybe if you think about it we can work on how you might go about doing that. But you don\u2019t have to be screaming <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202BB1\">from the inside. If you\u2019re going to scream, you might as well damn scream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202BD\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202BF\">THERAPIST: You know because at least you\u2019re not stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202C1\">CLIENT: Yeah Stuck \u2013 stuck is not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202C3\">THERAPIST: Stuck sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202C5\">CLIENT: And I recognize that stuck isn\u2019t going to help anybody. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah but really it\u2019s about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202CB\">THERAPIST: You know I mean tell me what that experience might be like for you as you imagine it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N202CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561252\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CD\">CLIENT: (sigh) I think in the past I would have said it was probably the scariest thing that I could imagine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CF\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D1\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s probably not as scary as I used to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D3\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not exactly sure you know that there \u2013 there\u2019s probably been some emotional, or some maturation, or you know some whatever, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D7\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D9\">CLIENT: Just getting to the place of like well screw it. You know it\u2019s like I\u2019m 50 years old, you know. I can do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202DB\">THERAPIST: Um-hum. And 50 is young. So can you imagine, because you can forseeably do this for 25 more plus years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202DD\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202DF\">THERAPIST: Right, and we just get older, you know. We didn\u2019t get different unless we make it different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E1\">CLIENT: Right. Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E3\">THERAPIST: You know, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E5\">CLIENT: Well I get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and so you know if you look at it, you know, that might be a scarier truth that if you don\u2019t speak your truth, that you could have another 25 years. Because I wonder if, and I don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know your wife. But I\u2019m going to speak this out loud, you tell me your thoughts on it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202E9\">I wonder if your wife is using the marriage as a cover of normalcy. Everything\u2019s okay. Appearances are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202EB\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think as the spouse that would piss me off. Because she gets the cover while she gets to go have an emotionally intimate relationship, if not a sexual relationship. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202EF\">And if you, you know, we can talk about women\u2019s sexuality and some of the things, and I teach human sexuality class. Women\u2019s sexuality is more fluid then men\u2019s often times, right. On a continuum of heterosexual, homosexual and bisexuality, you know women are at least more likely to admit being bisexual, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F1\">And so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in that relationship. Women have the freedom to be deeply, emotionally intimate with one another without a sexual component. But that might be there. It might. And I think you\u2019ve already thought of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I \u2013 I imagine that you\u2019re suffering in silence, you know, accept your own rage within you and depression is deafening. And she gets to use the marriage as a cover while you don\u2019t get your needs met.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F7\">CLIENT: Um-hum. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202F9\">THERAPIST: Right? And you started the discussion about Lisa with saying well she\u2019s who \u2013 this is how we used to be. And that would just piss me off on so many levels. Because you don\u2019t get any parts of your needs met. And the marriage gets to be a cover for your wife, you know. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202F91\">this simplistic, but you know while she can have these intimate needs met while you are suffering. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s really unjust. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202FB\">CLIENT: Um-hum, um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202FD\">THERAPIST: But you \u2013 you can state your truth. You don\u2019t have to be in silence. It won\u2019t change her behavior, but it might change things for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I really yeah. I really \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m getting to that place even though I\u2019m not you know I\u2019m not sure I can walk out tomorrow and do that. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20301\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20303\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m getting to the place where I feel like yeah, you know I need to be able to say this for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20305\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20307\">CLIENT: And in full recognition that nothing \u2013 nothing will change. Or if it does change, it might be for the worse.

Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20327\">CLIENT: And you know, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m you know I\u2019m great with that. And I\u2019m supportive of all that, but I also see in him you know it\u2019s like my God, you\u2019re living this life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20329\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2032B\">CLIENT: You know and it\u2019s like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2032D\">THERAPIST: Like what?

(laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20331\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. So he\u2019s living this life of being trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20333\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20335\">THERAPIST: Yes. Because his brain is one thing and his \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20337\">CLIENT: And you know, he\u2019s you know, he\u2019s 60 years old. He has three grown children. He has a young daughter, you know, his wife is actually fairly supportive of him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20339\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But she \u2013 okay, so he told his wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2033B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2033D\">THERAPIST: Okay, but that\u2019s the big difference in some ways. Somebody knows his story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2033F\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20341\">THERAPIST: You know, no, not somebody. You do and his wife does. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20343\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20345\">THERAPIST: And you keep your story to yourself, which is you know \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20347\">CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20349\">THERAPIST: And you know, I\u2019m glad you have shared it with me. But you know so in some ways, you know, yours is worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2034B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2034D\">THERAPIST: Because he at least has told his wife. He\u2019s told a close friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2034F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20351\">THERAPIST: And the telling of one\u2019s story is a powerful thing. And you have kept your story close because you keep trying to rationalize or understand or rework it or be empathetic to your wife\u2019s trauma. But you yourself are traumatized by what has happened in your marriage. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20353\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20355\">THERAPIST: I mean it\u2019s been traumatizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20357\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, and I get that. You know and it\u2019s \u2013 you recognize that you know it\u2019s like you know there\u2019s a kind of this trust relationship that\u2019s been built up and then it\u2019s like naw, no trust anymore. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20359\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2035B\">CLIENT: So that yeah. That\u2019s certainly traumatizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2035D\">THERAPIST: Well, it is. But it doesn\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t change her and that is the frustrating part. But your own silence is painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2035F\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20361\">THERAPIST: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20363\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20365\">THERAPIST: And I think that\u2019s the part that is \u2013 because you do have a choice. You don\u2019t have to stay in this marriage. You don\u2019t. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20367\">CLIENT: Well \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20369\">THERAPIST: And I am not suggesting you should get a divorce. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20368-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20368-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561252\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2036B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2036D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t suggest such things.

Or she\u2019s says <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203CD1\">I\u2019m not happy with you know the fact that the kids aren\u2019t going to church anymore.

So it was interesting, I talked to all these other people, but I told my wife. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203E7\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203E8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203E9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like you know this is what I\u2019m going to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203EA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203EB\">THERAPIST: And her response was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203EC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203ED\">CLIENT: Well because it came out of you know left field for her, she was like what? What? You know and like are you sure you can\u2019t do this, you know like could we wait like three years until the kids are out of you know school, so that we\u2019re not trying to pay for you know, all of this college at one <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203ED1\">time. And you know so I know she\u2019s coming at it from the whole financial aspect of it. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F1\">CLIENT: But of all the people I talked to, she\u2019s the only one that wasn\u2019t like encouraging.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N203F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561252\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F5\">CLIENT: You know so it\u2019s taken a while and I think she\u2019s on board in terms of like at least somewhat supportive of that, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F7\">THERAPIST: But in some ways that\u2019s a small way of standing up for yourself. It\u2019s kind of actually a pretty big way. It\u2019s not a small way. Because you decided you needed to do this for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it really \u2013 and I did it in a way that was probably atypical of what I did before. It\u2019s like okay, I know if I go through the normal channels of the way I would \u2013 I\u2019m going to talk it over with her and eventually I\u2019m going to get to this place of like well, she\u2019s going to get upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203F91\">about that you know, so I\u2019m just planning this all in my head. And she\u2019s going to get upset about this and I\u2019m going to back down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203FA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203FB\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203FC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203FD\">CLIENT: And I \u2013 I\u2019m not want to do that. I just want to go for this. This is what I want to do. So it was like (sigh) so that was a little gutsy I suppose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203FE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20400\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20401\">CLIENT: For me, but I yeah. It was, I did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20402\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20403\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20404\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20405\">CLIENT: And here I am. And I\u2019m still living to tell the tell and all that stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20406\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20407\">THERAPIST: And here you are. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20408\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20409\">CLIENT: So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2040A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2040B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I think there\u2019s a lesson in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2040C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2040D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I know that it\u2019s there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2040E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2040F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20410\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20411\">CLIENT: You know and again I feel like I know that this is \u2013 this is the dragon that I\u2019ve got to fight you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20412\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20413\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I do wonder where you got reinforced for the backing down? It didn\u2019t start with your wife. It\u2019s there now. You know and maybe that\u2019s something next time we\u2019ve got to look at. Where you got reinforced for the backing down. Because that\u2019s where you started having to swallow all of your <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N204131\">own feelings. Or all of \u2013 put people\u2019s needs before you put your own. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20414\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20415\">CLIENT: Backing down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20416\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20417\">THERAPIST: Backing down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20418\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20419\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s probably been there from the get go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2041A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2041B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But see you\u2019re not okay with that. You know, sometimes it\u2019s compromise. Compromise though is different than continuing \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2041C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2041D\">CLIENT: Yeah compromise is actually having coming from a place \u2013 a strong position and being able to give and take a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2041E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2041F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re describing in backing down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20420\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20421\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20422\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20423\">THERAPIST: And if you think about it, your parents didn\u2019t know anything about college, but you did not back down. Right? You went to college. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20424\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20425\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20426\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20427\">THERAPIST: They didn\u2019t really want you to go to Boston, but you went.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20428\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20429\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2042A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2042B\">THERAPIST: You know so with the times in your life that you have followed your own voice, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2042C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2042D\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2042E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2042F\">THERAPIST: Have been validating times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20430\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20431\">CLIENT: Um-hum, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20432\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20433\">THERAPIST: So I would imagine that that\u2019s where our work can focus. Where you follow your own voice. Good or bad. You know it was interesting, so last night we had a friend over. My husband and I were talking. And they were talking about you know, these are intellectual guys, so they\u2019re talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N204331\">you know, perceptions of masculinity and all of this stuff, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20434\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20435\">CLIENT: (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20436\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20437\">THERAPIST: You know and how it\u2019s you know structured \u2013 they could say it better than I. But one of the things that they talked about, right, and I always like to kind of listen because I find the discussion fascinating is that you know how society constructs manhood and some of the very rigid things <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N204371\">that men have to do and have to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N20436-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20436-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561252\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20438\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20439\">CLIENT: Um-hum. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043B\">THERAPIST: How sometimes you know, you know you have to fight, even if you know you\u2019re going to lose. And you know so one guy who is not the physical athlete guy had to fight with his intellect. And you know my husband, you know and so \u2013 it was interesting because they said because sometimes you are <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2043B1\">just called to do that and be that as a man. And you know if you don\u2019t fit the stereotypical kind of machismo male role, how you have to find other outlets for your masculinity. But sometimes you know you just have to fight even if you\u2019re going to lose, right? And I\u2019m like what? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043D\">Right, but \u2013 and I thought about it. And in some ways you have to fight I wonder even if you think you\u2019re going to lose, because the fight is about you. It\u2019s not really about your wife. It\u2019s about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043F\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20440\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20441\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re in a fight for your own peace, your own happiness, your own freedom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20442\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20443\">CLIENT: Yeah, no it is, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20444\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20445\">THERAPIST: Your own sense of self really, you know. And the fight is to finally validate for yourself. You\u2019re not only okay, but you\u2019re really a good human being. And you don\u2019t have to make everybody happy to be a good human being. And it\u2019s not you know \u2013 you really do get one life to live. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20446\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20447\">And so you kind of have to live, it sounds corny, but you sort of have to live your own best life. And that does not mean always backing down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20448\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20449\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044B\">THERAPIST: And you know you swallowed all of that shit, you know. And that\u2019s where the rage and the depression and the anger come from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044F\">THERAPIST: Because nobody can continue to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20450\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20451\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Now \u2013 yeah. No, yeah.

How does that sit with you? As we \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20458\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20459\">CLIENT: I think \u2013 no, it \u2013 it all seems to flow. I get all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2045A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2045B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2045C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2045D\">CLIENT: You know I\u2019m not exactly sure you know, just in terms of like you know, I know that I don\u2019t fit the role \u2013 you know the typical male role model stuff. Yeah. I\u2019m not exactly sure where I\u2019m going with that piece, but. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2045E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2045F\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20460\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20461\">CLIENT: No, that resonates a lot.
