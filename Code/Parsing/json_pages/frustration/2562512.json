Friday, I ended up getting a lot of schoolwork done which was great. I didn\u2019t really get any work done on the application for the masters program yet, but that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going to pick up my transcript tomorrow. And then, the woman said that if I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">it in by Friday, that\u2019s fine. So I have the rest of the week to work on it. And I don\u2019t really have any other classwork besides trying to get ahead a little bit, so I\u2019ll have time to do it. I had a very frustrating day on Saturday, because I might have mentioned to you that I made a plan with my father <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">for the first time in a while to go to the movie (inaudible at 1:00) [1:06] And that we were supposed to go Saturday night, but then he had to change it to Saturday afternoon, the matinee show, because he didn\u2019t realize that it was Purim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: At the ROT?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: IT wasn\u2019t at there, it was at elsewhere. But whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m smiling because, you know, the donkey show. It\u2019s about A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. And they have this ongoing thing there. I would not imagine -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: No, we didn\u2019t go there. But anyway, he says to me, he sends me a text message on Friday night and he says, so do you want to come to the house at 12:00 to have lunch with us, and then we\u2019ll take the train down to Providence and I was like, sure. Fine. The show was at 2:00. It was supposed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">be originally Saturday night. So I would have had all day Saturday to do my work, but then it changed and so like, whatever. [2:09] So I get there at 12:00. There\u2019s no lunch Ethan\u2019s going to play basketball. Tracy is getting ready to go for a walk. And my father\u2019s like, all right, well, we just have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">to drive the U-Haul van back to U-Haul and then we\u2019ll walk over to the train. And I was like, what the fuck? It was like, this is a really perfect example of these situations where I would just really like you to let me know what\u2019s going on before I get here. This text that you sent me implied that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">I was coming here for lunch. And he said, well, I thought we were going to or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And I was like, yeah, but you could have called me and been oh, by the way, I have to return this thing. Or, you could have arranged it so that you returned it beforehand. Like, now it\u2019s 12:00. The show is at 2:00. We were supposed to have lunch. We\u2019re also taking the train. Stuff takes time. So I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">irritated. So then we came up with this solution that he could return it afterwards. And I was like, you could have returned it afterwards? He\u2019s like yeah, until 8:00 [3:03] And I was like, then why the fuck are we \u2013 we have a plan. So then we start walking to the subway and he\u2019s walking the slowest <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">that he could possibly walk, ever. And I was like, okay like, I get it. Like, you\u2019re old. Then why are we taking the train right now. Like, why didn\u2019t Julie offer \u2013 like, why didn\u2019t they make a plan so that Tracy would drop us off or do something wifey. I don\u2019t know. And then I was just like, to come <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">out of his street, there\u2019s this like, parking lot you can cut through to this building that\u2019s there then, it\u2019s instead of like, going up the hill and around, you\u2019re like, going like this. So you get to this point quicker than if you go around. This is the point you\u2019re trying to \u2013 So I was like, going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">up that way and my father kept walking around. And I was like, Dad, what are you doing? Why don\u2019t you come this way? And he doesn\u2019t say anything, doesn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m like, waiting at the top of the hill for another two minutes. I called my mom in a panic. Just pretend you called me so I have someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">to talk to right now, because I\u2019m going to blow my top. [4:02] Then he like, saunters. And then I\u2019m like, what the hell? He said, I can\u2019t, my lung problem. The doctor said I can\u2019t walk up too many stairs. And I was like, but why didn\u2019t you say that then? I\u2019m wondering what the hell you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200176\">just walking the other way. He said, well, you know, whatever. Then we get to almost the subway. The subway\u2019s coming. He\u2019s like okay, let\u2019s run for it. I was like, now you want to run? I was like, no. I run for subways Monday through Friday. I\u2019m not running for this subway. There will be another one.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562512\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">So then I kind of start to ask him and talk to him in a way that I thought might be productive. So, you know, Dad, what happened with the plan today? You know, how come \u2013 just like, kind of wondering like, what\u2019s going on that \u2013 whatever. And he was just kind of, eh, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019d have to ask <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">Tracy. I\u2019m like, what? Like, no, I wouldn\u2019t have to ask Tracy because she doesn\u2019t know what the fuck\u2019s going on all the time. She didn\u2019t\u2019 have any idea he was planning on returning the (inaudible at 5:01). She didn\u2019t know anything about our plan. Like, I don\u2019t understand. [5:04] So we get down there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">and we pick up the tickets and I got frustrated, because we go into Panera, and I was like, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re seating. He was like, let\u2019s just take a walk around. And it\u2019s like, packed to capacity and I felt like I was in McDonald\u2019s. And I was like, no, let\u2019s just go somewhere else. Never mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">I was like, this feels like McDonald\u2019s. He\u2019s like, there\u2019s two seats that are opening up. They\u2019re like, two lounge chairs with a little coffee table. I was, I\u2019m not going to eat lunch. Like, I\u2019m sorry, Dad. Do you want to eat lunch or have coffee and a cookie? There\u2019s a difference. And then we end up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">at Beau Johnson which is fine. Nobody was there. You know, I got a reuben. It was great. Fine. And I tried to talk to him a little bit about my grandmother and his brother and whatever. And he was very just like, well, what do you want me to do? I can\u2019t talk to him. And oh yeah, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">got to look into. Yeah, that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to work on in April and May. You know, just not really talking to me about it. He just kind of talks. I don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t ever like \u2013 he won\u2019t figure out how to address something. 6:02} He kind of is like, well, I don\u2019t really know what to say. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B3\">You know, yeah, I\u2019ve got to work on it. It\u2019s kind of very -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: How about completely disengaged?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Completely. Completely disengaged. And, you know, at one point, I expressed frustration of things never really being planned and stuff. And I said, you now, I said it\u2019s upsetting to me and it causes a lot of tension that I don\u2019t think needs to be here. And his answer is, well, what do you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">to do about it? I\u2019m like, I want you to do something. Like, act as if you care that I\u2019m trying to tell you how I feel. Like, that\u2019s his response. His kneejerk was, well, what do you want to do about it. Do something. Try. And then I say that and he\u2019s like, well, yeah, I guess I\u2019ll have to work on that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">I\u2019m like, what? So we go to the show. It\u2019s like, not that great. We get out, it\u2019s already almost 5:00. And it\u2019s kind of windy. It\u2019s cold. He\u2019s all stiff, because he\u2019s fat and is all old and his hips hurt and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562512\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">THERAPIST: How old is he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">CLIENT: Seventy-two. [7:11] And he\u2019s like, well, let\u2019s just walk. If you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll walk up to another street instead, because I want to stop at the temple, because I left a hat there. And I was like, when did you leave the hat here? He said, I don\u2019t know, a couple weeks ago? And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">and just now I get to be the lucky person who has to schlep up to this fucking place with you? He\u2019s walking the slowest that I\u2019ve ever walked with anybody, and I\u2019m freezing. I didn\u2019t sign up for this. We\u2019re walking up the hill. It\u2019s really windy. It\u2019s cold. He can barely walk. He\u2019s like oh, it\u2019s further <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">than I thought. And I\u2019m just like \u2013 and I start questioning. I\u2019m like, why isn\u2019t this something like \u2013 why didn\u2019t Julie help you with this? Why didn\u2019t you make plans so that you could drive down here, somebody waits in the car and you go pick it up? Like, what\u2019s going on that you happen to be down here <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200233\">and just because of that, you need to go see if it\u2019s there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">Of course, we get there, the place is closed. So we can\u2019t even pick up the fucking hat. And then we\u2019re walking. You know, and he\u2019s like out of breath and he can\u2019t walk. And I\u2019m like, Dad, why don\u2019t we just get a cab home. [8:04] He\u2019s like, no, no, no, no, no. We don\u2019t need to do that. I\u2019m like, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">your doctor told you not to \u2013 I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s so weird. This doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. And then we get back. It\u2019s like 6:30 or something now. And we\u2019re walking up the street. He\u2019s giving me more of these stand-offish like, well, what do you want me to do about it. I guess I have to I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">know what. Again, disengaged as you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">And then Tracy\u2019s walking out of the house. Hi, Sweetie, want to come to the (inaudible at 8:37) and I was like, no, I do not. She\u2019s like, oh, you\u2019ve had enough? I was like, yeah, I have. See ya. Thanks. Like, for six hours. And I knew spending an afternoon with him I just really was hoping that it wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">be so unpleasant and it wouldn\u2019t be him being completely disengaged and not really caring to \u2013 oh, what\u2019s going on? How\u2019s the class? You know, but he doesn\u2019t really give a shit. He\u2019s like, well, what exactly are you studying? He doesn\u2019t really care how the class is going. He just wants to be sure I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">being interesting enough of something. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s how I feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: He wants to make sure you\u2019re what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m being like, interesting enough.

That\u2019s what I feel. Like, he doesn\u2019t really care, except that he wants like \u2013 So, what are you learning? What have you learned? He likes to learn stuff -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: A different conversation would be like, how much money are you making? Is it more than last year? Are you improving yourself?

Exactly. It\u2019s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: As opposed to sort of really wanting to know about it or about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Right. Okay, wait. Did we talk about Death of a Salesman last week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: Okay, so for class, we had to watch \u2013 Are you familiar with the play?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s been a while, but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well, we watched the scene from the version that Dustin Hoffman is playing Willie Lohman, the guy. And John Malkovich is playing his son, Biff, who, you know, who he has a hard history with. And Biff is always screwed up, or whatever. Anyway, it\u2019s just this very poignant scene where basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">\u2013 I watched it with my mother, because I was like, watching videos at her house, because I was doing laundry on Friday. And it made her really upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: This past Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. So like, after I left here, I went to her house. [10:50] And I can\u2019t really like, it\u2019s hard to explain, I think. But basically, Willie Lohman always wanted his kids to be the best and be super successful and da, da, da, da, da. And there\u2019s this really important moment where Biff is saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">finally like, I\u2019m not that. I\u2019m this person. I\u2019m not this person who you think I am or want me to be or have tried to make me be or whatever. I\u2019m this person. They have this moment where they\u2019re like, fighting and they were both crying and hugging and embracing and walked upstairs and Willie, at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">end of all that says, that boy. That boy is going to be something. He\u2019s going to be something special. He\u2019s still \u2013 even through that moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: He missed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Right. It\u2019s still oh, look at that. He cried in my arms. He\u2019s going to be something important. He\u2019s going to be special. As opposed to he\u2019s my son. And it made my mom sad, because it made her think of how my dad is with Michael and how my dad is with me and whatever. And that\u2019s like, it is how <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">I feel with him and I know Michael feels the same, too. He\u2019s always \u2013 These articles he sends me and things that he tries to get me involved in. It\u2019s always like, it\u2019s not good enough. No matter what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not good enough. [12:13] You know, it\u2019s not good enough that I\u2019m taking a course. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">It\u2019s like, well, but what have you learned so far. And what have \u2013 oh, what kind of readings are you doing? What are the books that he\u2019s assigned? Because he\u2019s the type of person that wants to walk around spewing stuff as if he\u2019s some sort of academic. Well, he\u2019s not. And that\u2019s where he gets his self-importance. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200473\">But like, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s nuts and \u2013 he\u2019s old and overweight and forgetting things. And then, we\u2019re talking about this absurd trip. He says he\u2019s going to go to Austria again. He went to Austria randomly last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: For a very short amount of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: No, it was for a week, but it was very last minute that he planned it. It was out of nowhere and it was by himself. And whatever. He wants to go back and he\u2019s got some plan because of some art thing that he saw, or some bench. I couldn\u2019t even follow it. [13:19] But it\u2019s something fucking insanely <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">self-serving. Like, that he feels this is a cool artsy thing. So it\u2019s like that. And about this Austria thing. I had hoped that you dropped it by now. And I\u2019m very rude to him about it, because it\u2019s so fucking stupid. And after he\u2019s explaining it, on my birthday, no less. Because of course, that\u2019s all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">he can talk about is himself. You know, Tracy\u2019s sitting there rolling her eyes like, oh, whatever, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562512\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">And I\u2019m \u2013 so I said to him, I\u2019m like, have you dropped this idea yet? He\u2019s like, well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just trying to see how it will work out. And I said, well, you need to stop. And he\u2019s like, well, you know. And I said, who is this trip going to benefit besides you? Anybody in our family? Anybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">that you relate with directly? Well, you know, your grandmother peripherally. Because it\u2019s like, Holocaust related and she\u2019s from Austria. And I\u2019m like, no. And he\u2019s like, well, the issue is that I can\u2019t do these things in another five years, so I\u2019ve got to do them now. [14:19] I was like, no. The thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">is, you should have done these things 15 years ago. That ship has sailed. If you\u2019re going to do anything now, don\u2019t go back to Austria to do some cockamamie street art performance. I don\u2019t understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">It\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Go to some other country you haven\u2019t been to with your family if you want to do stuff before you can\u2019t do stuff anymore. You can\u2019t all of a sudden want to do these artsy things that nothing is going to come from it, but you feel you\u2019ve accomplished something for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">yourself? And I don\u2019t understand why Julie wouldn\u2019t say, no. You\u2019re not doing that. Sorry. Instead of like, well, whatever. You know, I\u2019m out of that one. It just was very unpleasant. And I got home and felt that my whole day was sucked up by him walking slowly and having to go get his fucking hat that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">we couldn\u2019t even get. I was like, was this an expensive hat? He\u2019s like, no, I just like it. I was like, so you let it sit there for three weeks? [15:26] (pause) It makes me never want to hang out with him. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: I think he actually like hurts you a lot pretty much every time you see him or interact with him. It\u2019s much harder to talk about that aspect of it, because it puts you in a much more vulnerable position. And it\u2019s much easier to talk about what an asshole he is. I\u2019m not disagreeing about that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">I\u2019m just saying, I think that, you know, you are (inaudible at 17:38) fury at him come from his being so hurtful. Mostly in treating you in ways that make you feel like, you know, very disrespected or like you, as you kind of are in a regular way, are not really even there or are of no interest whatsoever. [18:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: Right. It was as if even an activity that I thought was more geared towards me enjoying the activity that we were doing just turns into him \u2013 it just turns into his thing. He doesn\u2019t have a plan for lunch. He has to walk slowly. He has to take the train instead of a cab. He has to rent a U-Haul. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">He has to look around in Panera for a seat when it\u2019s obviously too crowded. He has to get his hat because we happen to be down there and I don\u2019t mind, whereas, Tracy might have said, no, Honey, we\u2019re not doing that right now or whatever. And then on top of that, when I actually tried to have a conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200532\">with him, as opposed to complaining or yelling or getting upset, he brushes me off. [19:19] Well, okay, I don\u2019t know what to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562512\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you really keep trying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like, why, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess you really want it to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I owe it to him and I owe it to myself and I owe it to any kids I have and I owe it to Jesse. You know what I mean? I don\u2019t want to have a damaged relationship with them. But they\u2019re kind of making it impossible for me to have anything but that to a certain extent. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B1\">so unwilling to change anything about how they do anything to accommodate anybody besides themselves. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I think it must feel to you like some of the stuff I\u2019m saying about your being hurt and not being able to talk about it must feel to you like I missed the main point. Or, by saying that you keep trying because you want to make it work. So like, that doesn\u2019t seem quite right, either. [21:33] <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">I mean, what you said was well, you feel like you owe it to yourself and to him and to any kids you have in the future. Which is different. My point is it seems to me like it seems to you as though I\u2019m a bit off in how I\u2019m, you know, things that I\u2019m saying. Because the way you\u2019re responding says sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D2\">of, kind of like, correct or reorient what I\u2019m saying a little bit. That\u2019s why I imagine you\u2019re responding that way to me. [22:13] Am I right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: Okay. I don\u2019t know. No, because I mean, you\u2019re right that he really hurts my feelings. But it\u2019s more that it\u2019s hard for me to not let those feelings just sort of manifest as anywhere towards him. So that\u2019s I think why you end up hearing or something. Like, I really \u2013 there were moments when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">I seriously had to just breathe and talk to myself. Because I wanted to throw a fit or get in a cab or run away. I just didn\u2019t want to be there. I didn\u2019t want to be with him. I didn\u2019t want to be on the green line. None of it. [23:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s look at that a little bit. You said, you know, well, actually you\u2019re right and it does hurt me a lot, what he does. It\u2019s something like, and with the way I reacted was to get angry is what I\u2019m hearing. I guess it seemed there like you sort of in thinking again about what I said, took <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">it in a different way. And it sort of registered with you in a different way. And then you turned away from that pretty quickly to focus on reacting in an angry way. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. [24:42] I\u2019m just thinking of what you said. But I think there\u2019s something going on when we\u2019re talking where, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200612\">you know, at first it felt to you like it felt to you that I wasn\u2019t quite right which, maybe I wasn\u2019t. Or, and then sort of in this iteration it\u2019s a little more like it\u2019s hard to take in or there\u2019s something that\u2019s dangerous about taking it in and less dangerous about focusing on being angry. [25:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: Well, because I wish I had a different father. I wish I had a better father. But then I feel guilty saying that. So yeah, it\u2019s easier to just say, well, so then I get angry. I might be angry, but I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Then also I feel guilty, because he has been good in certain respects. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">there\u2019s lots of people that don\u2019t ever have a father. And they\u2019re like, I wish I had a father. Then I\u2019ll feel guilty. The whole perspective thing. If I had a father that beats me. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: There are kids starving in China, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. I should just eat this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562512\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">THERAPIST: And be happy with the father you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [26:40] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">THERAPIST: So are you worried about being ungrateful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">CLIENT: Kind of. Yeah. And I feel guilty that it\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s old and has bad lungs or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: I guess too harsh in light of how fragile he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: Right. Although if he had just lost weight ten years ago like he should have, then maybe he wouldn\u2019t be having all these problems now. I feel the same about both of my parents in terms of their weight. Just resentful of the fact that they\u2019ve not been able to get a handle on either of their weights <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200731\">and not made any real concerted effort. [28:00] I don\u2019t know. I feel guilty about not wanting to see them ever. I don\u2019t \u2013 even Jesse. And I feel really guilty saying this. He\u2019s my little baby brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">But he\u2019s awkward and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just that he\u2019s 14 or that he\u2019s just going to be a weirdo because of his parents, or if he has Asperger\u2019s and whatever. I don\u2019t know. But I just find it unpleasant hanging out with them. I don\u2019t find Jesse that fun. He\u2019s not really fun to talk to. You can\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200751\">talk to him about everything. He gives one-word answers. Fine. Whatever. [29:10] And Julie just asks superficial questions. I never even know if she understands what the fuck I\u2019m saying. Like, yesterday we were walking, limping up the street. And I was like, his hips. She was like \u2013 because he was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200752\">bring an Advil. And I was like, his hips, his hips. And she was like, oh. And then I got up to her and was saying something else. She was like wait, what? Why is he walking like that? Why would you say, yes, if you had no idea what I was just fucking saying? So how much has that actually happened throughout <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200753\">my life with her. Oh, yeah. And she has no idea. And I don\u2019t think she gives a shit. And so she just asks you superficial questions. How\u2019s everything. I could be like, oh yeah, you know, I want to fucking kill myself every day. And she\u2019s like, oh, good. Or, she\u2019d tell me to fucking hang in there or <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200754\">something else equally stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: You really keep trying. [30:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, man. I stopped for a while and then I felt bad or something. I can\u2019t anymore. I\u2019m never doing a plan like that with him ever again, ever. And quite frankly, I don\u2019t think I ever want to have with him a moment. There\u2019s no point. It\u2019s not pleasant. It\u2019s not like oh, I\u2019m going to have lunch <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">with my daddy and catch up and we\u2019re going to have fun and laugh. Oh, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m so glad to hear that. It\u2019s never like that. It\u2019s always tense and unpleasant and I\u2019m unhappy and I\u2019m irritated at him and something\u2019s happened. Or he\u2019s forgotten something or starts off poorly because he\u2019s late or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re definitely trying to convince one of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to convince us both, I guess. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Maybe you have two really different reactions. One which you\u2019re sort of clear about and feeling in a lot of the time where you\u2019re just pissed off and exasperated. And want to put as much distance as possible between you. And another one in which you\u2019re worried and you care about him and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">feel bad and you want to try to help. And you want to try to make it work. And you want to try to talk to him in a way you can kind of feel connected. And you\u2019re terribly hurt. [32:05] I think there\u2019s something going on whereby \u2013 I don\u2019t know. If I\u2019m pointing to the second part, I feel like there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F2\">something where that\u2019s hard to take in. I feel like I don\u2019t understand that very well. I\u2019m not sure why.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562512\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: Wait. You\u2019re not sure what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: Like, when I say things that point towards that second part where you\u2019re feeling more hurt or more caring or even more guilty, that it feels to me sort of that it doesn\u2019t quite land with you. Like, you kind of push it away or you turn your focus back to just being pissed off. And I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200831\">know what\u2019s going on there, but it\u2019s distinctly different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: My first thought might have been, I was just wrong. That certainly happens all the time and there\u2019s a good reason \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: No. He really does hurt me. I really am very hurt by this whole situation with him and Tracy and Jesse and just everything. [34:15] And how he treats my brother. Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I mean, I imagine that it\u2019s, you know, in some way parallel to like, it probably in some ways it\u2019s very difficult to get through to him, trying as hard as you are where you just can\u2019t get to the part of him that needs caring or seems to want to connect. Or feels a sense of commitment to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: Right. I feel like he only has a sense of commitment to himself. [35:38] And like, wanting to feel like he can say he has \u2013 Oh, my daughter works at MIT. Like that kind of thing. (pause) [36:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like a big disappointment to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: No. Well, it\u2019s like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. No. I don\u2019t know what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking of Biff and Willie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: No. I mean, I went to college. I have a job. I don\u2019t know. I think he is disappointed with how we turned out. So it doesn\u2019t matter whether I agree with him or not. He\u2019s going to think that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying it has any basis in reality or anything to do with how you see yourself. [37:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like to a certain extent he feels like I\u2019m a disappointment in certain ways. I\u2019m not interested enough. I don\u2019t read The New Yorker. I have credit card debt. This and that. I don\u2019t go to enough lectures. I\u2019m not interested in enough stuff. He has this kind of superiority complex, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200991\">but I don\u2019t know where he got it. If he wanted to be \u2013 It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to grab onto these stupid things now when it\u2019s like, if you wanted to do stuff, Dad, like, that was interesting to the world or to you or artistic or academic or write stuff or whatever. But you can\u2019t just all of a sudden decide <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200992\">that you want to do it when you\u2019re 70-years-old and you\u2019ve got a teenager. [38:42] Like, you didn\u2019t do that stuff. You chose to get married and have a kid instead. Sorry. That was your choice. (pause) I feel guilty feeling all these things. He\u2019s still my father or whatever.
