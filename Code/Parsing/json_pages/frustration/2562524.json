I was going to come to work and then go straight to the airport from here because I\u2026 my plane\u2019s at 5:00, but then I just realized that I\u2019m not sure when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">I\u2019m going to have time to pack and stuff so\u2026 yes, 9:15 on Wednesday. [1:10] That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Oh, I don\u2019t have a pen; I can\u2019t write it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh, thanks. Okay. So, Friday night I went to sleep really early because I had to work. I had to be at work at 7 a.m. but I was done by 9. So I went back home and hung out for a little while and then met up with my mom who\u2026 because we were celebrating her birthday. [2:18] And I think I did an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">okay job keeping my patience with her for the most part, but I get really frustrated with her because A) she\u2019s overweight, and I just hate it. And I hate that she has to pull the thing all the way out to put the fucking seatbelt on, and then it still looks like it\u2019s strangling her. And because she has <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">to pull it all the way out it clicks back and locks, so then she\u2019s stuck in place for the whole ride. And it always takes her five minutes so then she\u2019s squeezing it past her fat. And I\u2019m just like your life would be so much more comfortable if you would just lose some fucking weight. I don\u2019t understand. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">And I get she\u2019s old, but she can lose some weight. I don\u2019t understand. I just can\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s something that I can\u2019t wrap my head around, why\u2026 and I\u2019ve had... mentioned something like this before about fat people, getting enraged at fat people, because I guess she doesn\u2019t get it. Unless you have some sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">of genetic thing going on, which this girl that I know, her sister has to have something wrong, genetically, because she\u2019s been obese since she was a child. And they have more money than anybody that I\u2019ve ever known in my life, so that\u2019s\u2026 they\u2019ve had nutritionists and they\u2019ve had personal trainers and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">she\u2019s still huge-ungo. So there\u2019s clearly something wrong there. I know for a fact that my mom can lose weight. She just has to not eat as much. [3:44] So I have a hard time keeping my mouth shut. But then I made a comment about it and then promised I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it for the rest of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">day. Fine. And she can\u2019t walk anyway because of her knee issues, but it would just be that much easier if she was 50 pounds lighter. Everything in her life would be different. And she just doesn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t understand. She\u2019s like just be\u2026 just lay off me. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like something\u2026 and I think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D7\">also, it\u2019s upsetting\u2026 it gets upsetting for me because then it turns\u2026 if feels like it\u2019s reminiscent of when I was trying to get her to stop drinking, and please, please, please why. And it would be like just leave me alone. Like if she had a glass of wine, please don\u2019t drink it, and oh, just leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D8\">me alone. Just let me do what I want. So I don\u2019t know. I have a hard time\u2026 and I have a hard time not getting frustrated and reacting. I had to hold my frustrations a lot. I don\u2019t know. I swear, a lot of it, I really think, has to do with her weight. I really think a lot of my resentment towards her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D9\">currently, like when I get angry at stupid shit for no reason, is because she\u2019s fat. And it\u2019s a really hard thing to feel because I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t really know how to deal with it. It just makes me frustrated in a lot of regards. I\u2019m always\u2026 she\u2019s always\u2026 she\u2019s so much slower. Everything is slower. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D10\">She can\u2019t do this\u2026 in the car, I asked her to get something out of the glove compartment\u2026 the fast lane out of the glove compartment. She couldn\u2019t because she couldn\u2019t lean forward because the thing is already\u2026 she\u2019s like this is a defect in cars. And I was like no, you\u2019re fat. [5:27] And they shouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D11\">make\u2026 those planes, they\u2019re just making those planes smaller and smaller. I\u2019m like really? Are they? Or are you just not losing weight ever? I don\u2019t know what to do with those feelings because on one hand, she\u2019s right. Just lay off her, mind my own business, and live my life. But on the other hand, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D12\">she\u2019s my mom and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I could imagine that her not being able to control how much she used to drink or now how much she eats, I mean this is on her but it\u2019s also about the kind of [inaudible] you need her to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: And I mean we had a really nice day. We got manicures, pedicures, and then we went to a furniture store. And my brother was pissing me off, too, because he was all\u2026 he kept calling me. I\u2019m stressed at Mom\u2019s birthday and I don\u2019t know what to get her, and I don\u2019t have any money and she wants it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">to be this big thing. And I\u2026 and he gets like that. And I was like take\u2026 I\u2019ll take care of it. Don\u2019t worry. If there\u2019s anything involving money I\u2019ll handle it. And so I bought us our manicures, pedicures, and drove us up to a furniture store. [7:07] We looked at mattresses and stuff and then I got really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">annoyed at her because she was like $700 total for a boxspring and mattress and delivery, that\u2019s absurd. I was like Mom, the last time you bought a mattress was 25 years ago. What the hell did you think was going to happen? That was a really good deal. That\u2019s a really good deal and you\u2019re buying the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">lowest end piece of crap. It\u2019s worth the $700 if you\u2019re going to be in it, potentially, for the rest of your life, if you spend 20 years on a mattress. She\u2019s just so annoying about that. Oh God, these prices these days. And I\u2019m like you\u2019re 70. Don\u2019t act like it so much. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re 80. Why <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">is everything so expensive? It\u2019s ridiculous. These things are\u2026 and a Mercedes was cutting in front of us, something like that. She was like is that a Mercedes? That\u2019s obnoxious. I was like why is that obnoxious? Well because they\u2019re flaunting their money, the one percent. I was like they\u2019re probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200215\">not. They\u2019re probably\u2026 are leasing it like I\u2019m leasing my car. People are probably calling me obnoxious in my Infinity. She\u2019s like well it\u2019s different. And I was like it\u2019s not. There are some people that, yes, there are\u2026 they are obnoxious, and they happen to drive a Mercedes, but I mean fuck, mom, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200216\">just because we don\u2019t drive Mercedes doesn\u2019t mean that everybody\u2019s obnoxious just for having one. [8:15] It\u2019s just these things bother me when she says them. And then so they have a TV place, also, at the furniture place. And she said well let\u2019s just have a look because she also needs a new TV because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200217\">she had one of those old tube TVs. And she has a Roku to watch her Netflix and the Roku doesn\u2019t work with the old TV because [inaudible] the right connection. And so we had been talking about this as part of the\u2026 buying her a new mattress and fixing things up in the guest room where Michael used to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200218\">live and whatever. And they had one that was a Toshiba 32\u201d on sale for $200, which is really good for a brand new TV like that. So I was like I think we should get it. It\u2019s a really good price. May as well. And Michael was like can we buy it for her. I was like you mean can I buy it for her. Sure. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200219\">then I told my mom, I\u2019m straight up going to pretend I\u2019m buying you this right now, but I can\u2019t afford the entire thing so\u2026 and she\u2019s like he can afford $100 to give you for that. And I was like tell him that. And then we did that and then we went up and\u2026 oh, on the way over there he\u2019s like well so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002110\">I can sit in the car while you guys go in, right. [9:25] And I was like no, this is the activity that she wanted to do for her birthday. This is the activity that she wanted to do for her birthday. The idea was that she wanted to do an activity that she wanted to do with her kids. No, you can\u2019t sit <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002111\">outside. What the fuck. It\u2019s always fucking something. Oh, yes, I\u2019m\u2026 and then she\u2019s like well he does have a thing, a cyst or something here, or something that\u2019s bothering him when he walks. I\u2019m like okay, mom. And she\u2019s always coddling. And then we go to downtown because she wanted to have\u2026 she looked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002112\">at some places. And of course I ended up paying for the meal. And then he\u2026 I was like well how about you give me $20 because it was like $68. I was like how about you give me\u2026 no, how about you give me $30. And that was all the money he was spending on her that day. And I had meanwhile spent money on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002113\">manicures, money on gas, money on this TV, and more money on the dinner. And I drove around and found parking and everything, dropped them off so they wouldn\u2019t have to fucking walk, crippled and retarded, and then he only gave me $20. And I was like whatever. And I think I lost it, on top of everything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002114\">So it\u2019s like\u2026 it was a wash anyway. So that was kind of frustrating. Then we get back to the\u2026 oh, no, we\u2019re leaving the furniture place and my mom\u2019s like this is great. And Michael, maybe you can, while you\u2019re doing laundry, you can set up my new TV. And he was like Lori, [ph?] can you? [10:49] I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002115\">like\u2026 and then my mom\u2026 and I said to my mom I can\u2019t believe you just said that. She\u2019s like well he doesn\u2019t believe in himself. So I was like what? Why does it always have to be oh, poor\u2026 she\u2019s just\u2026 and then she\u2019s like what\u2019s the matter with you, because he got angry at some girl in a dress on the street <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002116\">and was like fucking\u2026 said something more reminiscent of how he was. She\u2019s like are you using? I was like mom, really? Michael\u2019s like no. So it was semi pleasant but I really had to keep my cool a lot with both of them, and it was tiring. And not to mention I had had a really long week. I had been up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002117\">early and everything, and so we got back to the house, we helped her move a bunch of furniture around. She had to change the stand where the TV was. I helped figure out the TV. We plugged in the Roku, the whole thing, and then I was like all right. Michael\u2019s like no, hang out. And I was like nope. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002118\">almost nine; I\u2019m going home. [12:01] So whatever. And then I didn\u2019t have to see them Sunday. Sunday I ended up having a little adventure because\u2026 so I had decided that I\u2026 so I had been feeling weird in the house and, just as I mentioned, not sleeping great. And not having nightmares, but some of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002119\">could be attributed to the upping to the 20 milligrams and I still had been on the 20. And I think that has been helping in just controlling getting upset, similar to how the 10 was in the very beginning. But this is what I\u2019m afraid of. I want to kind of try to nip this in the bud in terms of depending <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002120\">on the medication. And try to just go forward with the 20 but on top of making a more concentrated effort to try other things that\u2019ll make me feel better so that maybe if it does start to drop off it\u2019ll\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20023\">THERAPIST: It\u2019ll still be enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, to\u2026 or I\u2019ll have these other things started so that I can start to look towards that and maybe slowly get off the meds in the next\u2026 I don\u2019t care. Whatever. Day by day. But I mean my goal is to not let the 20 milligram get to the point where there\u2019s 10 milligram [inaudible] so shitty again <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200251\">that I have to go up 10 milligrams. [13:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: I see. So after talking about the way your mother and your brother were, maybe, is not so surprising that you\u2019re like I don\u2019t want to depend on this thing because maybe it\u2019s not even when\u2026 it\u2019s never going to be there for me in the way that it was supposed to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And then I\u2019m in trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. But anyway\u2026 and also, well there\u2019s something wrong with my automatic feeder so [inaudible] been really restless in the middle of the night, but more so the last few nights. And I\u2019m super superstitious. I\u2019m juperstitious. I coined that phrase yesterday. So I was like why\u2019s he bugging out <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D1\">so much in the middle of the night at this time and so\u2026 and I\u2019ve been getting the chills, and I find myself sprinting past their doorway and the whole thing so\u2026 of where Nathan died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: What were you what? Did you\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: No, no, I was just thinking\u2026 I see. So I hadn\u2019t gotten at first that the juperstitious was because maybe the cat\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Is sensing something, energies or whatever. So I made the decision that I wanted to figure out a way to cleanse the energy in my home. And not only because of this thing but just kind of spring is coming, I\u2019m really going to try\u2026 I really want to try to\u2026 I was getting back into my diet and exercise <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">before the thing happened on Wednesday that I just\u2026 threw me off course. [14:41] And so I thought let\u2019s just see what I can look up and research and whatever. So some friends told me different things, like one person is saying ring a bell in the corners and burn some incense. Another person\u2019s saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200352\">spray perfume and get fresh flowers all around the house, and you do this incense. Another person said oh this incense smells horrible but it\u2019s to drive out spirits. So I got a lot of input from people, which was neat. But white sage is traditionally what super superstitious people use to\u2026 it\u2019s like\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200353\">maybe you\u2019ve seen it in movies or whatever. Oh, let\u2019s clear the air of spirits. Mediums use it, and they use it in powwows. It\u2019s like has a lot of origins in Native American traditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20037\">THERAPIST: As much as anything is official for getting rid of bad spirits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20039\">CLIENT: That\u2019s it, exactly. So\u2026 and I\u2019ve heard of it before; it\u2019s called smudging. And the way that it was described on the couple of websites that I looked it up on is basically every house has like a video recording of stuff that happened in those walls. And using the white sage smudge, where you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200391\">basically just waving the smoke around either with a stick or with a\u2026 fill a shell with the\u2026 and actually, traditionally, abalone shells are used. It\u2019s a whole thing that I didn\u2019t know about. And\u2026 with a feather, and you disperse it. But the six are a quiver because it\u2019s a big\u2026 it looks like a big incense <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200392\">stick. And it\u2019s just white sage. It smells delicious. [16:08] And it\u2019s supposed to help kind of just smudge the memory of the video recording of the house, right, so you\u2019re\u2026 so I\u2019m looking up Native American shops and looking up where to find it, and then of course it\u2019s a Sunday and I kind of want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200393\">get it done because I\u2019m going away on Wednesday. It\u2019s Monday starting the week, I do my cleaning on Sunday, and also I read on websites oh, you should clean your house early, open all the windows, this kind of thing. And Helen into it too. And also the downstairs neighbor, who I said hey, can I put <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200394\">some sage above your doorways and smudge the hall, and she\u2019s like yeah, a friend was actually telling me. So if you get some sage I want it. I\u2019ll throw it on. Because she wants to do it to the house too. Because neither of them have slept there since. Anyway, and so I\u2019m looking online and I\u2019m finding <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200395\">a couple of things but not really anything. Of course after the fact my brother was like oh, this place downtown\u2026 and my friend\u2019s sister\u2019s like oh, this place downtown. Who knows if they would\u2019ve been open. Either way I end up finding this place. And there was a Facebook page so I called the number <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200396\">thinking it\u2019s a little shop. It was listed in East Stoneham. And it\u2019s just this lady, like hello? I was like I looked up your blah, blah, blah. And she was like oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I don\u2019t have a shop. I\u2019m working on affording one, but yeah. And I was like\u2026 so I guess she sells all sort of Native American <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200397\">artifacts and is called on to bring and sell sage to all sorts of\u2026 she goes to powwows all over and whatever. [17:49] So she\u2019s like I can send it to you. And I was like I want to do it today. Maybe I can come meet you somewhere, whatever. So I asked Helen if she wanted to take a little drive with me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200398\">and we drove out to East Stoneham. And it was really funny because we drove in and we\u2019re like oh, we\u2019re at Brown. And it said five minutes so we\u2019re like oh, this is\u2026 we thought oh, crazy hippy lady lives in God knows where, on a farm with chickens. And then we\u2019re joking around like oh, well this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200399\">surprising that we\u2019re in Princeton, that we\u2019re in this neighborhood. And we\u2019re like watch, we\u2019re going to cross over some train tracks and that\u2019s going to be her neighborhood. Literally, we cross over a bridge and some train tracks and it was like ghetto. Anyway, she was sitting on her porch with her <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003910\">dog waiting for us with the sage, a pound of sage, $20, and her sage sticks. And she gave us a gift of a feeder stick, which is also apparently good to burn. And we were telling her what happened and she was like there\u2019s nothing to fear with the room or with the bed. That room should be smudged. If <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003911\">the roommate can\u2019t do it because the other roommate isn\u2019t there, you should at least try to crack the window and\u2026 from the outside or something. She\u2019s like that room really needs it probably. I mean of course I\u2019m superstitious but of course I take everything that these people say with a grain of salt. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003912\">[19:02] But when I was speaking to her on the phone originally, first of all, one of the things that she said that made it feel like this is something that I can get into is\u2026 she\u2019s like well usually you don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think you should buy one of those fancy shells that people are saying are the right <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003913\">ones to use because Mother ocean doesn\u2019t like people taking her jewels for\u2026 just to get the\u2026 killing basically the fish inside the shell just to use the shell for this purpose. So she\u2019s like for instance, I use quahog shells because they\u2019ve already been used to feed people. And I was like well, I love <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003914\">the ocean a lot and I\u2019m really into it and I have a huge shell collection. She\u2019s like perfect. She\u2019s like spread out a couple of shells that might work and let it choose you. And that\u2019s what\u2026 I was kind of into it because I love my shells and whatever. Hey, I\u2019ve been collecting all these shells, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003915\">they\u2019ll come into use, although I don\u2019t have any huge ones. But\u2026 and then she said\u2026 well first she was like oh, you should do the smudging\u2026 start in the east corner of the house, which happens to be the corner that the room is in where he died so that was kind of cool and go clockwise around. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003916\">a lot of this stuff is\u2026 I read, too, and basically let in whiteness, white light, to yourself. And as you\u2019re going, say out loud with intention I\u2019m.. we\u2019re sending all of the bad negative energy out. We only want positivity. Rob or any other spirits that might still be hanging around, you can leave. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003917\">You have to move on. We\u2019re going to be okay, your family\u2019s going to be okay, everybody\u2019s going to be okay. You can go. Superstitious stuff but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, [inaudible] mystical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right, right. And I am\u2026 I have\u2026 I am into this stuff anyway. [20:56] I\u2026 yeah, I mean I\u2019m superstitious in terms of the [inaudible] and the evil eye and Jewish stuff, like wearing the [inaudible] and mezuzah and the whole thing. And so\u2026 and she was super interesting. Apparently she used to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2003D1\">as a sage. [ph?] And again, you take everything that these people say with a grain of salt. But apparently she worked with Janis Joplin and Willy Nelson. And Willy Nelson buys sage from her apparently. I\u2019m like what else does he buy from you. I mean she\u2019s clearly a pothead. And then she mentioned something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2003D2\">else about it. I\u2019m sure she sells weed. So\u2026 oh, and another thing that struck me that she said. I had already\u2026 I was already like I\u2019ve got to write in my journal because I\u2019m still writing in my journal that I started on my 30th birthday. And I\u2019ve not been as consistent with it but it\u2019s been nice. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2003D3\">I had already planned on kind of writing about this but just haven\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right. Whoever she is she hooked you up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20041\">CLIENT: Totally. So she says to me\u2026 Ethan, she says\u2026 I\u2019m telling her about it and this and that and she said write about it. She said write it down. Write on it. And I was like I actually\u2026 I journal, and I actually am planning on writing about it. And she\u2019s like that\u2019s great. And if you see a spider <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200411\">that means you should write about it. And I was like okay, you fucking kook. What the fuck are you talking about. And I was like I don\u2019t see spiders too often but if I do, whatever. [22:18] And literally, I couldn\u2019t tell you the last time I happened to see a spider somewhere, anywhere. And sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200412\">you see them just somewhere. I\u2019m sorry, I feed into this stuff, but at the same time it is a little strange that I go into my office this morning and right as I put my bag down I see that there\u2019s a spider web. And I was like oh, weird, I don\u2019t see a spider. I should clear the spider web away because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200413\">it\u2019s dust and it\u2019s\u2026 I cleared the spider web away and there was the spider. And it crawled away. And I was like uhm, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20043\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a little uncanny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20045\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a little uncanny. I mean\u2026 and it\u2019s like there are a lot of things I feel like I can\u2026 that I kind of create for myself. Sometimes when I get the chills it\u2019s like okay. So when we got back and we were doing the whole smudging thing\u2026 she also said put dry leaves above the door frame of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200451\">house. And your house and everything. And some underneath your bed even and whatever. I went to go start to do it at their door but I got the chills and I had to step back. And I think some of that stuff I can, okay, I can be superstitious about, but I can also attribute it to the fact that as I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200452\">walking to the door I actively envisioned them rolling his body out, and it gave me the chills. But this was a little weird just because I wasn\u2019t looking for the spider. I had totally kind of put it out of my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right, it wasn\u2019t like you saw it in some random corner walking on the street. It was at your desk. [23:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And you\u2026 and [inaudible] hard to miss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D\">CLIENT: And, on top of that, this morning, in a little bit of time, I started to write about it. And I didn\u2019t really finish. So I was like whoa, okay. And so I texted the woman. I was like hey, so, out of nowhere I saw a spider today. She\u2019s like the universe is talking\u2026 speaking to you. You\u2019re listening, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D1\">cool. And I was like yeah, cool. But she was super nice and she was like I\u2019m in Providence all the time. If nobody wants to go in the room, call me; I\u2019ll do it. And we\u2019re like all right, great. She\u2019s talking to us about all these ghost stories and whatever. And I mean I\u2019ve always had my little beliefs. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D2\">There was this\u2026 when we moved into the place in Jamaica\u2026 in Waltham, we were on the third floor. There was nobody above us. And I remember the landlord, who was on the second floor, had said he has a son. And I remember in the beginning I heard what I thought was somebody, little footsteps running back <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D3\">and forth above me. But I was like oh, that must be his son downstairs running back and forth in the hall. And I heard it a bunch of times. And then, this was months later, that I found out his son is 17 and lives away from home. [24:42] I was like that\u2019s weird. And then I would hear it every so often, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D4\">and it was definitely coming from above me. And I have no explanation for it. And it was like footsteps running back and forth. So things happen and whatever. I\u2019m not\u2026 but what\u2026 even if it\u2019s like\u2026 whether it\u2019s a placebo effect, just the fact that I did it and I\u2019m thinking about it. But I slept better <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D5\">last night and [inaudible] was also\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Good. For whatever reason, that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20051\">CLIENT: \u2026 calmer. Yeah, for whatever reason it is, I slept better. It just\u2026 both me and Helen felt lighter and just nicer after we did it. I didn\u2019t find myself as scared to walk by their door. I was kind of feeling better about it. And [inaudible] slept better so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me making <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200511\">that up. Maybe he\u2019s\u2026 I just didn\u2019t notice his antics as much, but he seemed a little bit calmer last night than he\u2019d been the last few nights. I do believe that animals feel spirits and stuff like that. I mean whatever. But so it was a really interesting experience but I\u2019m kind of into it. I did it <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200512\">again this morning. I mean the lady was like you\u2026 I smudge everyday. I think you should smudge every day, at least until you really feel like any negative energy or spirits from the death are out because the death just happened, blah, blah, blah. [25:54] I was like all right, whatever. But then\u2026 now <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200513\">I\u2019m totally into it, actually. And what\u2019s interesting is that in thinking about this religions degree and kind of thinking about ways that I\u2019m going to try to make my life different and make it so that I\u2019m not so miserable and hating my life and, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s an ideal time for this kind of random <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200514\">connection with this random lady to have happened because it has me thinking about some other things. And just, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m into the smudging thing and wondering where that\u2019s going to kind of leave me next, and how that\u2019s going to fit into what I want to base my graduate degree on, and if I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200515\">going to be looking at some of those traditions, too. And yeah, I\u2019m feeling much better as a result. I mean I\u2019m kind of dreading [inaudible] It\u2019s at my Dad\u2019s house. And it\u2019s only with Karen and Nathan and their children, and they\u2019re usually the people that we spend these holidays with, even in\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20053\">THERAPIST: Who are Karen and Nathan? [27:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20055\">CLIENT: Karen is a woman that my stepmother became friends with when they were in childbirth class or something together. And so Laurie and Jesse, they were both in vitro babies, so they bonded on that. And then they adopted a little boy after and yeah. So I mean it\u2019s good that it\u2019s only them, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200551\">don\u2019t want to talk to how\u2019s things going, oh yeah, work is shitty; it\u2019s boring. I hate my life pretty much. I\u2019m working on that though. Yup, no, still not dating anybody. My roommate\u2019s awful. And I can\u2019t really say that kind of stuff. I have to\u2026 work\u2019s good. oh yeah. Somebody just [inaudible] underneath <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200552\">me. Oh, meanwhile, my landlord doesn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20057\">T: Oh my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20059\">C: So I went up to him on Saturday. I saw him in the driveway and I was like hey. And he\u2019s like hey. And I was like so have you seen the girls downstairs? He\u2019s like no, I haven\u2019t. And I was like\u2026 no, I was like have you talked to either of them? He\u2019s like no, what happened? And I go honestly, I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200591\">sure if it\u2019s my place to tell you. And I was just like\u2026 and he\u2019s like okay, is it\u2026 well I mean I know they have a guy that moved in down there. [28:40] And I was like you mean who died down there? And I was like I saw the name on the mailbox. I didn\u2019t say yes, no, I was totally neutral. I was like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200592\">saw the name on the mailbox. He was like yeah, I wasn\u2019t too cool with that, but their lease is up in July so whatever. So and I was like oh, and he\u2019s like so I know about that. And I was like all right, well have a good day. So I didn\u2019t confirm or deny that that\u2019s what I was referring to or anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200593\">because I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my place, and I don\u2019t know what kind of a can of worms it\u2019s going to open for any of us. And I\u2019m shocked that somebody in the neighborhood hasn\u2019t told him because I\u2019m sure everybody saw. It\u2019s very strange.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That is strange. He lived on the third floor, right? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2005D\">CLIENT: And so then I told Elsie he doesn\u2019t know yet. And she\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t talked to Stephanie. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. I actually don\u2019t want to leave before July because it\u2019s going to be too difficult because I\u2019m moving back to Washington State anyway, but I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2005D1\">can\u2019t pay the whole rent on my own. So she doesn\u2019t know either. And she\u2026 he pulled up when she was talking to us. She ran inside. And she\u2019s not been sleeping there. She\u2019s just been going back and forth to get stuff or leave Curt when she\u2019s going to work, her dog. And he\u2019s apparently moving into a new <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2005D2\">house in Waltham this week. [29:55] So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Who is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20061\">CLIENT: My landlord. So he\u2019s going to be renting the apartment above us out. So yeah, so that\u2019s weird. So a lot happened, I guess, in the last few days. And I\u2019m still kind of trying to kind of just kind of think about it all. And then at the same time I\u2019m also getting ready, trying to think about getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200611\">ready for this trip. And I have to pack and whatever. Oh, and so the other reason that I\u2019m not really looking forward to tonight is that I guess I\u2019m nervous about my brother because I\u2019m sure that they\u2019re going to be drinking wine because my dad has no tact and would be too embarrassed to have to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200612\">out how to explain to Amy and Rob why he\u2019s not serving wine or something. I\u2019m not sure. This is my guess. I have no idea. Maybe I\u2019ll be shocked and there will just... it\u2019ll be [inaudible] thing. But I think it\u2019s going to make Michael uncomfortable. And also, honestly, I\u2019m dreading Michael asking me <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200613\">to drive him home, which I don\u2019t want to do because he lives really far away. I\u2019m not\u2026 he lives in Watertown. Yeah, I don\u2019t want to do that. So hopefully my dad will. [31:23] I wish I could not feel the way I do about my mom and her weight and stuff. And I think that the worst part of it is that I\u2019m\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200614\">I think about my nonexistent future husband and what if his family\u2026 his mother\u2019s not overweight and I\u2019m embarrassed about mine, or\u2026 and both my parents are overweight. And Julie\u2019s not overweight but she\u2019s just as embarrassing because she wears her jeans up to her neck. I\u2019ve always had an issue with <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200615\">being embarrassed at my parents. Also, I\u2019ve actively decided to continue to see Sergio despite it being non-committal and retarded. I\u2019ve just decided. I\u2019ve made the decision that I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m just not ready to deal with that kind of a rejection or loss of a person that I\u2019ve depended on in some way or <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200616\">another. I\u2019m just not. So get ready for lots of drama, possibly. No, I mean I think I just am not\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m just not interested in not being able to have him to depend on if I don\u2019t want to be alone or if I want to go out to dinner or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20063\">THERAPIST: There seems like you\u2019re just putting it out there and not feeling so bad about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. [33:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20067\">THERAPIST: It is what it is, and that\u2019s what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I mean the upside to that is if I\u2019m not looking at it as a relationship I\u2019m actually trying to take seriously, I can still also be looking for one that I am. I mean, to be honest. And so whatever. We\u2019ll see how it goes. It might blow up in my face. We\u2019ll see. Yeah, but about <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200691\">my mom, I\u2019m not sure. And my parents, in general, but my mom, I think that she feels like she stopped drinking, that\u2019s enough. She shouldn\u2019t have to do anything else to better herself or me, pretty much ever, kind of. She goes to her water aerobics twice a week and it\u2026 that\u2019s nice for her but it\u2019s\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200692\">I mean it\u2019s not really fitness heavy. And she\u2019s certainly not\u2026 and then she comes home and eats a bagel with\u2026 slabbed with butter and jam and four coffees. (pause) I feel like it\u2019s literally going to have to make\u2026 take for me to get pregnant, until I\u2019m pregnant, and then I can threaten her. [34:43] <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200693\">If you don\u2019t lose weight before the baby\u2019s born then I\u2019m not going to let you carry her because I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll fall or you won\u2019t be able to get up or you\u2019ll sit on her. I mean that\u2019s just horrible what I\u2019m saying. I would not ever say that to her. But it\u2019s almost like I don\u2019t see what else will work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200694\">Or like a wedding. (pause) I mean like I said, even if she just lost 50 pounds, which I\u2019m sure she could stand to lose 80, but if she lost 50, life would just be more comfortable. And at her weight it\u2019s not going to take that long. I mean six months. And if she continues to just try to have better healthy <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200695\">habits, but she just really doesn\u2019t want to. I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I like being able to go to her house and there\u2019s bagels and stuff that I don\u2019t buy much, but I would make that sacrifice if it meant that she was eating healthier and living healthier. [35:48] I mean her Mom died of a stroke. Her <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200696\">Dad died of a heart attack. I mean my father\u2019s have too, but that\u2019s less of a\u2026 I mean doesn\u2019t seem to affect me as much. (pause) And I try to tell myself just don\u2019t worry about it, but then I just\u2026 I get\u2026 it makes experiences that are a day long with her unpleasant because I just am feeling resentful <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200697\">inside. [37:03] I can\u2019t get myself to\u2026 and when I do, something happens, like the seatbelt she can\u2019t get on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2006B\">THERAPIST: No, I get that it sort of very actively bothers you. It\u2019s in your face when you\u2019re with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2006D\">CLIENT: Everything. It\u2019s a huge effort to be able to get off the couch. I\u2019m like she also has bad knees and she also has bad\u2026 whatever, fine, she\u2019s old. But it would all be easier if she were a little lighter. And it does. It\u2019s very much\u2026 it is very much in my face, whether it\u2019s what she\u2019s eating or <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2006D1\">how much she\u2019s eating or that she can\u2019t walk or that she can\u2019t get up from the couch or the seatbelt. It\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s like there\u2019s something about\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20071\">CLIENT: Or that her butt is knocking things over in stores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think there\u2019s something about her passivity; I just can\u2019t do anything, can\u2019t do anything the way she should be able to do them. She can\u2019t control what she\u2019s eating. She can\u2019t get on this. She doesn\u2019t even want to bother that\u2019s\u2026 completely drives you nuts. [38:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s even worse because she pretends that she doesn\u2019t care, but she does because of how she\u2019s reacting. If she really didn\u2019t care she wouldn\u2019t get so offended when I say things to her about it. She wouldn\u2019t be so reactive about just let me do what I want. It would\u2026 it\u2019s not like she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200751\">saying I\u2019m fat, I\u2019m fat. It\u2019s like that\u2019s\u2026 don\u2019t be mean. You\u2019re mean. You\u2019re being mean. So she knows. And then I get so mad when she\u2019s commenting on the oh, your seatbelt is\u2026 this is bad the way they do this. This is just bad the way they set these up. And I have to grit my teeth. And I was sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200752\">like no, they do it because usually when it\u2019s being pulled out that far it\u2019s because somebody\u2026 they\u2019re\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right, it\u2019s because they\u2019re stopping short.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20079\">CLIENT: Right. She\u2019s like well no, it didn\u2019t used to be like this. I\u2019m like no, you just didn\u2019t used to be this fat. It really bothers\u2026 the seatbelt thing is a huge bother for me. I get really frustrated. And then she gets really upset. She\u2019s like why do you get so mad? Why can\u2019t you just let me figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200791\">it out? Because she\u2019ll go\u2026 she\u2019ll sit in the car and it\u2019s like she pulls it, and then it\u2019s like she\u2019s like (client motioning?) and I\u2019m sitting there like this. Oh my God, don\u2019t get enraged. [39:59] Don\u2019t get enraged. And I\u2019ll sometimes try to help her and she\u2019s like no, just let me do it. It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200792\">five minutes. I\u2019m like just lose some fucking weight. Or tell me to help you. Or don\u2019t wear your seatbelt. It really affects me, clearly. Clearly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Clearly, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2007D\">CLIENT: This is more upsetting than the fact that anything, than any depression or miserable\u2026 and maybe this is, again, just feeling better after the smudging and the 20 milligrams. Things are feeling better than they were the last few weeks, which feels really, really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2007F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great. But I got it that this is driving you nuts and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20081\">CLIENT: And it doesn\u2019t\u2026 I mean that\u2019s when I don\u2019t see her for a while. It\u2019s when I see her a few days in a row that I\u2019m like I just can\u2019t. Because it\u2019s not in my face when I\u2019m on the phone with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20083\">THERAPIST: Or there\u2019s something kind of cumulative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20087\">THERAPIST: I mean I sort of guess the things I think are kind of obvious about it, that there\u2019s a passivity thing about not being able to do stuff, the thing about her not being able to control herself with her appetite, and also not being able to acknowledge that she can\u2019t do that, which is another <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200871\">aspect of not being able to deal with it. [41:33] And that that certainly is probably emblematic of ways she can\u2019t get her own shit together to take care of you, things that you find so shameful about it, and that it\u2019s just mother\u2026 it feels like you\u2019re kind of\u2026 you sort of inherit in a way. And the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200872\">way ones parents are reflect\u2026 can reflect on one. But I feel like there\u2019s\u2026 I mean it all makes sense to me but I feel like I\u2019m\u2026 there\u2019s something I don\u2019t have about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562524\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20089\">CLIENT: Well I mean I think that a lot of it all circles back to not\u2026 to being resentful of having older parents my mother had me when she was 40 and being fearful of now how old I\u2019m getting and not married and not having kids. And if that\u2019s going to me then she\u2019s going to be all the older, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200891\">how\u2026 is she going to be fat forever and what am I going to do? [42:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I mean honestly, the piece that I\u2019m missing about it is how the way you\u2019re talking to me about it relates to what you\u2019re saying about her. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2008D\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well maybe part of what you\u2019re saying is just fucking help me out because otherwise it\u2019s going to be me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20093\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t you see how stuck I am here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20095\">CLIENT: And you know, I\u2019ve also had really selfish thoughts of oh my God, they\u2019re not going to want to date me if they meet my mom before we get serious because then they\u2019re going to\u2026 because you know they always say well, if you want to see how somebody\u2019s going to look when they\u2019re older, look at their <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200951\">mom. I\u2019m like no, don\u2019t. And that\u2019s so mean. I feel mean spirited saying something like that. And is it selfish to want to have a parent that can walk more than three blocks? I don\u2019t know. Is it? I\u2019m not sure. Michael treats me like an asshole for always thinking about this and saying this. Just leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200952\">her alone; leave him alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20097\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s something going on with it, and I think something about the seatbelt, too, where you\u2019re feeling kind of strapped in to it or something like that with her. I mean that seems a little closer. Like Ethan, help me out with this because look what I\u2019m stuck with and look what I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200971\">to turn into. [43:54] And I can\u2019t do anything about it. And God knows she can\u2019t do anything. I guess you\u2019re as helpless as she is. And yeah.
