Well, I worked two days this week on a video shoot at the business school and I haven\u2019t worked like that in a long time. A long time. That was two 12-hour days and I have to say it was rather satisfying, partly because I was learning new things, partly because I was meeting new <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D1\">people and also because at the end of the 12 hours I felt like I (unclear) myself \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say I felt like I did something, but I felt like I spent a good amount of time doing something constructive that allowed me to feel like I didn\u2019t have to continue working into the night, there was an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D2\">end to it. And I had two 12-hour days and then yesterday, Wednesday, I had dinner with a professor of law from the Europe that advises the government there on anti-terrorist legislation. I interviewed him last summer and he said he was going to be in Providence and I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m in Providence, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D3\">we should have dinner.\u201d And that was great but also kind of work-ish. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You were kind of on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. So yesterday I felt like I could kind of take the time and take (unclear) of it because I was also doing things on Tuesday and Wednesday that were out of my skill-set, actually, operating a camera. I mean, out of my professional skill-set. So yeah, I guess the reason I mention it is just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">because I feel like that was part of the reason the week went by so fast and it made me wonder if just if working everyday \u2013 I first wondered if I could even do it. Like do I have the endurance to work? But it was, I felt like an old hand doing it and it just made we wonder \u2013 is that enough? Is it enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200512\">for me to do that kind of work, you know, at the end of the week feel like fulfilled? And I\u2019m still stuck on the whole \u2013 it\u2019s almost like those shows \u2013 \u201cwhere are they now?\u201d And they\u2019re kind of \u2013 they can be kind of a train wreck to watch because they\u2019re somewhere waiting tables and they used to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200513\">touring the world and whatever, playing arenas and they blew all their money so now they whatever. But it\u2019s almost like is this enough for me to be doing something like this? Is this enough for me to be doing something like this? Is this enough for me to feel like I\u2019m doing something I want to do? No. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200514\">It\u2019s not. But it is part of this larger them about continuing to learn, doing evening classes and so, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561811\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: What would feel like a full, satisfying life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a way to go question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: As it came out of my mouth I thought, \u2018that\u2019s not \u2013\u2019 What components do you need?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: For whatever reason I hated school but learning was always important and I get excited about learning new things that I can easily jump into \u2013 why is that? What is it about me that\u2019s deficient that I don\u2019t feel good about that in essence is the whole nest that I don\u2019t really want to try to keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">leaping to whenever I ask why do I do a certain thing because it\u2019s what I always do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And I think feeling motivated by learning something new is not necessarily indicative of being deficient in an area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: No, but I guess what I\u2019m wondering is, like everything else that I\u2019m questioning, is my motive pure? Is my reason for doing it because I really want to learn this or am I trying to impress someone or what is it exactly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: What if it\u2019s just to feel good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Well \u2013 why? Why do I want to feel good? Why am I feeling badly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Why do you want to feel good? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Because pursuit of happiness (laughs) is like a natural right, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: This just happens anywhere. Yeah, no I guess I\u2019m always cautious of the reason behind wanting to feel happy because what is it that\u2019s making me unhappy, you know? And that might not be a worthy pursuit \u2013 to go down that road. It might be futile and frivolous, I don\u2019t know, but (Pause) the fact <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">remains that I do enjoy learning new things and so without my even noticing it for the past several years, I\u2019ve kind of seen a theme, a pattern of community ed courses or adult education courses or a degree here or lining up a job of something that I haven\u2019t done before but would like to try to learn <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D2\">more about \u2013 things like that. Picking up different instruments. So there\u2019s a theme there and it seems to me that \u2013 and the more I think about it, the more I can go on and on and on. But it seems that I have this idea that I believe firmly in the idea that you can do whatever you want, whenever you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D3\">want. And for someone who doesn\u2019t have kids, that\u2019s more true than for other people. And for wherever you want, too. Again, am I learning because I like to learn or am I learning because I think when I\u2019ve discovered that one thing that I really want to do. And you know, again, I don\u2019t like questioning <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D4\">motives of things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561811\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think maybe a healthier question is, \u2018are you enjoying as you are learning?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, when I\u2019m not scared. (Laughs) On the job. At this gig, is frightening. That\u2019s part of learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Frightening \u2013 exhilarating frightening, or paralyzing frightening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Frightening is alright. Paralyzing \u2013 I just don\u2019t think it could happen. The idea that I\u2019d be exhilarated by fear is something that seems really foreign to me like why would I want to do that? That would scare the hell out of me. Why would I want to \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but isn\u2019t that somewhat of the thrill of elicit fantasies?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I mean. There\u2019s a connection there that the idea is exhilarating and fearful or fear inducing is something that I pursue \u2013 like wow, when did I ever do that? And yet, here I am. But yet, I think it\u2019s just the idea of learning, experiencing new things in the context of this video <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">shoot I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t anticipate some of these other things that we\u2019ve been working on. That said, I don\u2019t feel horrible when I\u2019m left doing it. (Unclear) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">So I guess that\u2019s not mine to think about \u2013 what is it about learning that is exciting, is exhilarating in ways that elicit fantasies provide some sort of kicks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You could actually not think about it and accept it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: (Laughs) I\u2019ll have to accept that then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: And I think \u2013 partly why I\u2019m pushing you on this is that some of the questioning and introspection that you do \u2013 there\u2019s a point at which, as you\u2019ve noticed, it becomes hurtful to you rather than actually helpful. The information that you might figure out doesn\u2019t actually help you move forward. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">If you\u2019re questioning whether it\u2019s okay to feel that way or what the true motive is \u2013 but if what you\u2019re feeling is what feels good in some way, scary but maybe exhilarating, satisfying at the end of it and it\u2019s not hurting anyone else, then that can be the end of it and that\u2019s adaptive. Learning stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200812\">is generally not harmful. It\u2019s pushing you into new areas. You feel good about it. You provided \u2013 in this case you provided a service to people. It doesn\u2019t have to be deeper than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, I get that and I guess when I say I have to think about it, what I mean is, \u2018how do I cultivate that?\u2019 And not lead myself into areas that are not making me happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: One way of doing that is noticing what you are feeling and letting the feeling guide you rather than thinking. Your natural place to go is to think about things and to really spend a lot of time evaluating, understanding. Thinking is a very useful pursuit, but when it eclipses letting yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">notice your intuition. We all have intuition but sometimes we can think it out of existence. But noticing at the end of the day, there wasn\u2019t regret, there wasn\u2019t shame, there wasn\u2019t guilt. That can guide you. When you find that, that feeling is the place to go again. And being open to things that feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">like \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of potential, having me feel satisfied and excited and useful and productive at the end of the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561811\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: And successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah, feeling successful is a big confidence booster which is often what you feel you are lacking.

The distinction or comparison between working for someone else\u2019s project at various times of my life and working on my own thing \u2013 and as I say that it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to cultivate in the past months, year, is that when I\u2019m playing guitar, when I\u2019m not writing something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">I\u2019m working on technique which is just something that I needed to do. It satisfies the need to have played guitar every day. Sometimes I just play scales for 20 minutes and just be gone. I\u2019m not checking to see who just texted me. I\u2019m not doing those things. I\u2019m totally into what I\u2019m doing. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200952\">a technique and I\u2019m just trying to go up and down the fret board.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: It feels good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: It does feel good. It is enough to feel I am not languishing as a musician, as in I didn\u2019t touch the guitar today. And then when there is not the inspiration to actually write a song or to continue working on a song \u2013 that\u2019s half of it. It\u2019s helpful. Now going back to when I first met you I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">was working on someone else\u2019s project, someone else\u2019s (unclear) \u2013 that\u2019s technique. That takes care of the interim of staying sharp, staying productive, staying successful, healthy, happy \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: But not having the pull for a need to be creative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yes. And so I think that in some ways answers the question of what components I may need. There\u2019s the technical \u2013 when I say technical that involves all sorts of imaginative construction. And there\u2019s the personally invested construction created drive that is sharpened by technical every <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">day. So I think for me what\u2019s lacking in this week so far is not at least touching that personal initiative project. Now when it comes to playing guitar, music \u2013 that involves the song with effort and that\u2019s just something that I need to cultivate. I need to build into the day like I have on playing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D2\">guitar, I have this reminder that comes up and says, \u2018read for 30 minutes. Play guitar for 30 minutes.\u2019 It\u2019s a daily reminder that shows up from my phone and from my computer. So whenever I\u2019m on, it shows up. Now, what\u2019s not there is work on lyrics. Whatever. Ten minutes. Ten minutes would be more than <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D3\">enough (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: And you feel like it needs to be a daily piece in order to feel \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Well, not necessarily but I do think it needs to be daily in that it\u2019s not going to fix itself in one day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not going to get to where I want to be with it by saying, \u2018once a week I\u2019m going to do this.\u2019 It will, ultimately, but it will take a lot longer. And I feel like I\u2019m talking stuff that\u2019s not very professional right now but it has meaning to me in that as I think about this it\u2019s kind of developing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">and I think for so long I have worked on other people\u2019s dreams and projects without any regard for my own and in that sense that component has been missing. So, as I said, in music, that\u2019s going to be 10 minutes a day writing words, editing, writing, editing. When it comes to professional that has a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A52\">few different aspects. One is the professional project that I want to work on which is the Schedule Seven website. That\u2019s more mundane than anything else. Am I putting you to sleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561811\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: No. Do I appear to be sleeping? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: No. No, you just look very comfortable. And then there\u2019s the radio documentary that I want to do on this noise pollution matter what I\u2019ve told you, but you\u2019ve probably heard about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t told me anything about your (unclear). I\u2019ve heard about the Schedule Seven thing but not the noise pollution thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a serious issue. But nobody knows it\u2019s a serious issue. It\u2019s a stressor. I\u2019ll tell you more about it later. But that\u2019s the professional like \u2013 I need to write a grant application. I need to get thousands of dollars to do this. There\u2019s a lot of things that need to happen. Part of the reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">I\u2019m taking this grant writing course is to learn how, continue to learn how to write grant applications (unclear) out there. That\u2019s one part of it. Why am I working on this video shoot? Because I want to do a film documentary on ballroom dancing and the craziness around it. But I think it\u2019s a matter <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">of balancing my own expectations because I can\u2019t say \u2013 well I can \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be successful for me to say I\u2019m going to think about this ballroom dancing documentary which is to me at least a year or two out every day. But the technique, working on the technique is there so that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD3\">when I get around to it, I know I can call up Todd House in DC and say, \u2018hey, I want to hire you to do this thing.\u2019 I want to call up Ruben Years, director of photography, and say \u2018hey, I need you to shoot this thing, are you available?\u2019 And then call up these people that I met Tuesday and Wednesday <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD4\">and that quote\/unquote \u201ctechnique\u201d, for lack of a better word, is in place for when I want to (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">So, in a way my week was spent laying the groundwork for the future and developing those things that are present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Because you know that these things are going to be put to use maybe someday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Someday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Right, and like you say, it doesn\u2019t make sense to say, \u2018well, I\u2019m going to spend an hour of my day every day developing the ballroom dancing project. So it\u2019s not at that place where it\u2019s really about the ballroom dance piece yet. It\u2019s about keeping contacts and keeping skills in the loop <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">for when it does actually become about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And you know there\u2019s the connection to sort of your bigger dreams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: And you know, part of the technique of the projects I\u2019m working on now is about telling a story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: All of this stuff is about storytelling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: I\u2019m telling a story now and will be telling a story then. And you know \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting. You actually have a lot more direction and focus than you give yourself credit for.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561811\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: This is all just over the past hour. I swear to you<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but these ideas are not all just from the past hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: No, they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: The whole guitar thing \u2013 technique versus composition \u2013 that is something that I\u2019m trying to apply. But actually, applying this to everything else just kind of came together as \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: But like the ballroom dancing idea, the noise pollution idea, this website idea \u2013 those things have all been there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: They\u2019ve all been there, yeah. But \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You just didn\u2019t know you had direction to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t believe I had direction to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Ah. Now you know how it kind of fits together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that doesn\u2019t need to be black or white. I do this or I do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re not all separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: They\u2019re not all separate and I think that\u2019s been, you know, I think one of the things you\u2019ve taught me is that things are not one or zero.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Except when you\u2019re coding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: (Laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: But even then, differentiate. But there is \u2013 does it have to be? I think for me for so long they have to be. Like the only way to learn an instrument is to do such and such and such and such. Well, that\u2019s one way to do it. But isn\u2019t there also the way where you don\u2019t learn to read music, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">don\u2019t learn all those scales? You just pick it up and you play it. Yeah. And people do it every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: In figuring out which method actually works best for you rather than deciding a hierarchy and what is the right method to learn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: If I don\u2019t follow that hierarchy I might as well just give it up now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Because that for me has been the rule for so many things in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: So that you sort of have, I guess two different things are jumping out at me. One is the difference between process versus content and I think that\u2019s kind of a switch you\u2019ve made as you\u2019ve started to look this week at what\u2019s the process that binds all these things together so that it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">feel like, \u2018I\u2019m a chaotic mess and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going or what I want to do.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Or, \u2018if I do this, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Right. So when you think about it in terms of content it might seem all over the place, like ballroom dance, noise pollution, terrorism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: But in terms of process it\u2019s all storytelling. And it\u2019s figuring out how you tell the story and what are the modes you can use to tell the story and what are the skills that you\u2019re developing that you can probably use regardless of the story that you\u2019re telling, figuring out how to engage <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">your audience and weave an interesting tale, is the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: So I think paying attention for you, always thinking about what\u2019s the process that I\u2019m developing? Because the process is the same regardless of where you\u2019re going. And then the other piece is sort of then not having to \u2013 it\u2019s a thing of figuring out that it\u2019s okay to have student-specific <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">learning rather than saying, \u2018this is how we teach a class and everybody has to learn this way and if you can\u2019t then there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u2019 Instead, figuring out what\u2019s the style that this student of life learns in and I\u2019m going to teach it to you in that way. Or, as an adult, seek out experiences <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD2\">in a way that matches my learning style.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200FC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561811\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Or adapt things to (unclear). Which I don\u2019t really know yet, but I will. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Well, I think part of what you do know is you tend to work best with some consistency, right? Like paying attention to this every day for a half an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s \u2013 see that is \u2013 there\u2019s tension there because to me that is how you learn. That is how you do it. There is only one way to do it. But, so far it\u2019s been effective. And so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: Maybe that is the way you do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve thought and if I\u2019m not doing it every day I\u2019m failing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: So maybe we need to change every day to regularly and regularly might mean daily or weekly or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Whatever the frequency is I know that if I fail at whatever, the plan I put forward is not a failure. It doesn\u2019t mean I might as well give up that instrument, you know. So there is that tension and I think it\u2019s a matter of figuring out, allowing for the discovery of how I learn as a continuing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">process \u2013 what works, what doesn\u2019t work. Judging doesn\u2019t work because it just makes me feel bad. Now you\u2019re absolutely right that the process is evolving. Now, I\u2019m not sure how else to go through life. I\u2019m not sure how people approach the idea of process in life without it being a continual process <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B2\">or if they figured it out at 18 and now they\u2019re supreme court justices, I don\u2019t know, whatever, that\u2019s fine for them. To have a process that doesn\u2019t evolve to me seems for me not sustainable. And the rigidity that I\u2019ve applied to how a process has to be has not been successful because it\u2019s made me feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B3\">like shit. Every day, to some degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: So in figuring out your learning style, rigidity is not useful for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: No. No. And failing and consistency leads to feeling bad which leads to not wanting to be consistent. I don\u2019t know why that is. It\u2019s like, \u2018well, I didn\u2019t do it yesterday, I might as well not do it tomorrow.\u2019 So tripping once means I\u2019ll never get up. And I don\u2019t know why that is. But it\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">pervasive throughout my \u2013 every aspect of my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: I think because it connects to your either learned or innate sense that one or zero \u2013 all or nothing \u2013 so if you fell then you\u2019re done, versus the feeling that it\u2019s not all or nothing and it really is a repeated process. If you fall, so you get up and you do some more. But I think if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">connect falling to failure, well then failure says it\u2019s over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Rather than, well you fell and it was a part of the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: Continuing to really challenge yourself to not see that one or zero, but to see all of the infinite numbers in between. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: The fractions, the decimals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Those things, yes. Broken down into as many pieces as you could possibly need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: At least 10 decimal places. But I think what\u2019s difficult for me is to make it a priority to understand that when I don\u2019t do something it has negative impacts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s actually a choice and it\u2019s not nothing on the other side, right? That it\u2019s negative impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know that if I don\u2019t do certain things, if I don\u2019t go to the gym I\u2019m going to feel like crap which is going to have a snowball effect on the rest of my day on all the parts of it. I know if I play guitar this morning like I did I feel like any time I pick up the guitar for the rest of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201231\">the day is just bonus, like I don\u2019t have to do it. And yet I\u2019ve got this reminder that says, \u2018do this.\u2019 And the reminder serves the purpose for me to feel good. Do you see where I\u2019m going with this?

What \u2013 maybe this is becoming a philosophical conundrum. It\u2019s not worth talking about but \u2013 yeah, maybe that\u2019s just it \u2013 it\u2019s how I learn. That what happens, that makes me feel bad. That is <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">what the process comes down to. It\u2019s not about playing guitar. It\u2019s about feeling good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s interesting to me about this conversation is that you\u2019re a human being and you\u2019re affected by a lot of things at one time. We can\u2019t isolate all the different variables the way we would in a good scientific experiment and so I think the variables that are sort of confounding each other <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201351\">here \u2013 is there\u2019s a part of it that is how do you learn? And so yeah, the negative consequence that you get, feeling bad when you don\u2019t work out. Yeah, that is part of the learning process and we would anticipate well \u2013 and I guess the question you\u2019re answering yourself is, \u2018if I know I\u2019m going to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201352\">bad and I don\u2019t do it, and I know I\u2019m going to feel good if I do,\u2019 why is that not enough to solidify behavior? And I think that may be why it\u2019s not enough \u2013 just that consequence of feeling bad or feeling good being enough to change behavior is that you\u2019re also responding to how you\u2019re being asked to do things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Forced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: Right. And you\u2019re not being asked or encouraged.

You know, very few people really do. We want to feel like we\u2019re in charge of ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the way you learn is by following \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the cut and dry, black and white world we\u2019re living in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: I think if you went over to the school of ed they might say something different about how they\u2019re teaching their teachers to teach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: There was an article in the Globe this weekend about what really is the best way to get people to behave in certain ways. Is it by saying, \u2018do this because we\u2019ve said so?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20150-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20150-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561811\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: Who\u2019s ever done that? Who\u2019s ever done something because you told them to do this, or else? No one has ever \u2013 unless you\u2019ve got a gun. But, yeah. No, it\u2019s \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: But that gets at the idea of fear-driven learning. People don\u2019t learn by fear. They can act \u2013 in a situation where someone is fearful they will comply, but it\u2019s not true learning because as soon as the threat goes away so does the behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: No, I hear you. I think there\u2019s been so much emphasis on \u2013 that\u2019s I\u2019ve put on being happy and doing the healthy things that are going to help me do it, that it\u2019s almost seemed like this authoritarian process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: Is that how your parents parented?

(Pause) I think my dad was more of the drill sergeant. And I say that not like everyone else says \u201cdrill sergeant\u201d. But he was the enforcer. He was the one who encouraged one to do something with \u201cdo it.\u201d Encouragement. And there was a lot of chores every day and we had <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201611\">weekend and Saturday chores too which was, you know, I just hated doing, I absolutely hated doing them. And as more and more kids left the house more chores fell on the rest that remained. There\u2019s something that Mom used to say \u2013 \u2018if you get it done you can do the fun things.\u2019 She always said, \u2018when <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201612\">you do it, you do a good job but it\u2019s just a matter of getting you to do it.\u2019 And I often think about that. You know, those two things. Unpleasant things can just \u2013 a lot of time you dread doing them \u2013 the amount of time it takes to do them you could have done 10 times and the energy that\u2019s required <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201613\">for me to do a good job on something is, it\u2019s \u2013 I know it\u2019s going to involve a certain amount of energy and focus and, I won\u2019t say excellence \u2013 responsibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Something to think about over the coming week is to look at the ways in which you\u2019re setting up your life to parallel the house you grew up in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean in terms of the physical space but in terms of what kind of chores have you set up for yourself? How are you enticing yourself to do them so that you feel better and then think about how might you set it up differently so that it doesn\u2019t feel like going to the gym and playing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201671\">the guitar and you know, being present, feel like the Saturday morning chores, because I think that what we want to stay away from is repeating the pieces that didn\u2019t work. The \u201cdo it, because I said so.\u201d And also the, \u201cyou can have fun after but not during.\u201d Stay away from repeating that and finding <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201672\">maybe a better way of motivating you \u2013 of course, there are life chores that you\u2019ve got to do but maybe there\u2019s a better way to motivate that doesn\u2019t reinforce that same feeling of dread and reticence that you felt as a kid. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah.
