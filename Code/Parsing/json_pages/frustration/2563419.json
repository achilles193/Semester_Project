Once a year, you throw a rager but it\u2019s a family rager.

They\u2019re out and they\u2019re on the porch and they\u2019re laughing. And some of the younger ones are being idiots and flicking their cigarette butts into my yard. I\u2019m like, fuck man. Three or four of those a year. It\u2019s like, \u201cCome on, man.\u201d But still. And I think most of them are in Frank\u2019s yard <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">so it\u2019s fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: But some will land on there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Some will land, man, some will land. I was a good shot with it.

That\u2019s cool. So I was\u2026 that was the great big plan. I was like all right, I\u2019m going to go off weed. It\u2019s going to be great. And I was like Carl isn\u2019t here for a week. I\u2019m like this is really bad time to transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a bad time to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like so I went to see my friend again.

He\u2019s like, \u201cBut are you around this\u2026 or tomorrow over this week?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cAnd anytime tomorrow before 1:00, anytime the week after 4:30.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cGreat. Can we meet tomorrow morning?\u201d He\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">\u201cYea, sure.\u201d Like, \u201cWhat time is too early?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cHit me at 11:00.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">And so I head out. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m on track to meet at 11:00. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d  I\u2019m like he\u2019s not reading his texts and I walk over to his house and the lights are off, the whole thing. I\u2019m like he\u2019s asleep so I just call him. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey man, what\u2019s up?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m here.\u201d He\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">\u201cOh shit. OK, give me a minute,\u201d and he wakes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">And it\u2019s funny. He\u2019s like, \u201cI was up way too late.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI totally get that. Not a problem.\u201d The neighbors got to stop me. I\u2019m like great. He\u2019s like, \u201cThis is a lot more (inaudible at 00:02:25).\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cGreat. Fantastic. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. So I have an X amount of dollars. What can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">you give me for that?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThis much.\u201d And he\u2019s tired and he\u2019s like, \u201cI have to pee real quick.\u201d Goes in and comes back and he\u2019s like, \u201cAll right.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, fuck. I go up to the scale. I gave you too much. Whatever. Here.\u201d (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: He gave you the bonus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yea. He did. He usually gives me a bonus so (inaudible at 00:02:50). And he\u2019s like, \u201cI have to\u2026 because my stomach is messed up and everything. I need to use the bathroom. I started taking more (inaudible at 00:02:58). I locked myself out. No big deal.\u201d  He\u2019s like, \u201cNext time we\u2019re going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">hang.\u201d It was good to catch up with him. He\u2019s a nice guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563419\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: So it got you through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, yea. And it\u2019s going to get me through for some time. And it\u2019s really nice. Although I will admit clearly it has put me in a bit of a manic state in that last night I was up most of the night. I have over the past few days in an effort to procrastinate from doing all the math I have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">do for Monday, I have become deeply invested in cleaning my office. And earlier this week I have by myself managed to rearrange basically every piece of furniture in the office except for the one giant square bookcase that takes up most of the wall. I\u2019m like that\u2019s never leaving because where else would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">it go? And the answer is in front of a window which is stupid. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s stays put. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Stays put. I moved some other bits around. There\u2019s most of them\u2026 like I moved this. This is crafty stuff. I moved crafty stuff to the basement. And I\u2019m like I\u2019m at the point now where what I need to do is collapse the magic cards and collapse all the minis as best I can which are all Ed\u2019s dumb projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">One, I\u2019m going through all my cards and I\u2019m like all right, boom, this is finally it. I\u2019ve pulled everything out I can possibly sell. Everything else is in boxes of a thousand that I can load to the store a few boxes at a time for $3 a box. I made probably close to $100 off of that which is nice. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">I\u2019m looking at this box of cards and I\u2019m going through shit I have. Yea, I remember this is like an old shitty Legends card. This is worth $150. Well, put this in a hard case right now. Put that in a box and other stuff. But I\u2019m willing to part with things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">This card is also worth $60. It was in the cube. I only have one copy of it. It\u2019s not going back in the cube. I can live without it and the other four cards that go with it are all close to the 60. One is a hundred bucks, one is sixty bucks. I\u2019m like there\u2019s a few hundred dollars right there already. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">And then there\u2019s the rest of the box which will go $700, ranging in value from a dollar to me to like $6 to me so like 20, 10, $20 to me. Ridiculous. There\u2019s\u2026 even I have people write me a big enough check. Why? I have to come back to those then. But we start doing it, we start doing deals. I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">I\u2019ll tell you what. All this money and the War Wagon over there and that phone carrying case over there plus this cash and these other toys I wanted. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: So you could still\u2026 I was thinking like in a way you could still purchase this stuff without feeling shitty about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yea, because I\u2019m buying this with magic cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right, right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Or if you can\u2019t give me money for it now that I want to give rid of I got it. I\u2019m just trying to clear that space out and it wouldn\u2019t be\u2026 I don\u2019t think it would be for that much. I think it was ridiculous. If he\u2019s like, \u201cYou have $2,000 worth of stuff you\u2019re not going to write me a check for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">like over $1,000.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, let\u2019s do a little over $1,000 and that War Wagon, that phone carrying case over there.\u201d And it sounds great and I\u2019ll come back later with the rest of the stuff in like a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563419\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But I think you make the\u2026 but you made the important link I think about\u2026 something about the studying of the math and that. It\u2019s like it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Oh sure, man. That needs to happen, right? And it\u2019s driven this incentive to like do these other projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yea, the intensity of that stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yea, and I\u2019m so close to the end of the magic project. I go to the positive cards that need to be sorted. And I\u2019m like I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I can see them. I know the end is almost here. I\u2019ve cleared every binder I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s\u2026 see, I think that\u2019s exactly the importance of it in one respect to you is because when you\u2019re\u2026 and this is true I think of engaging in like something very like intellectually challenging is like you don\u2019t know where the end is. You don\u2019t see the end. You don\u2019t see like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">point in time where you go, \u201cI\u2019m going to get this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Oh yes, it\u2019s done. That\u2019s true whereas with this it\u2019s sort of... and it\u2019s done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s right there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s been such a long time. I\u2019ve been doing this for three years as a project. And it\u2019s a lot of cards. And every time I think I\u2019m done I find more stuff. I\u2019m like oh right. And this last time I was like\u2026 I\u2019ve gone through. I was like, all right. I\u2019m keeping one of everything and I\u2019ll sell <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">everything else. And now I\u2019m like why would I do one of everything? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">I need a few hundred cards to show the history magic and like that I think is cool. I need a few hundred other cards because these are powerful cards not going in the cube and coming out of a cube. And I need another thing for like these are special art cards. Some are signed and some are foils and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">whatever and then the cube. And I\u2019m like and I think I can get by with just that. And so I\u2019m going through and just putting more and more stuff into 1,000 pound boxes to get rid of them. (inaudible at 00:08:39) forever and always.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Forever and always.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just so nice. And just going through boxes and being like I have all this stuff that I can throw stuff out. But also I have some of these useful empty shoe boxes which will sort all sorts of things. I\u2019m like I\u2019ll keep a few of these around and see what I can put in these. See what a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">difference I can make. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">So that\u2019d be good. So the second project I was to go through all the minis. I have this war room stuff. It\u2019s just boxes full of plastic screws, bits and pieces on it. What I really need to do is cut out all those bits and pieces and be like put them in a box and be like trash every\u2026 recycle everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">else because it takes up far too much space. Under tables and places where there\u2019s stuff like that. And whatever\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s kind of enjoyable to do all this, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, yea. I mean, to a degree. The mini stuff will be less interesting and so maybe of the fact of that will help me get to the math faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What are you\u2026 now what are you doing in math? What\u2019s the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: We\u2019re moving on from Z-scores into more stuff to do with normal distributions. And I\u2019m moving, moving.  I was going to go to math. I went to math on Monday only to find that school was closed for the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh, it\u2019s on break, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: So yea. So I have two tests on Monday. There was one test on last Monday and one.

I\u2019ll learn Chapter 6, the rest of Chapter 6\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Which is on normal distribution?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: \u2026which is on more advanced normal distributions and stuff like that and then go into seven which is on stuff I don\u2019t know about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll find that distribution stuff interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: I do. What I\u2019ve found so far is fascinating. I love it, absolutely love it. I started charting out distributions of die rolls, of 3d6 altogether which is the standard for Dungeons and Dragons, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: So you roll 3d6. And so I wrote\u2026 put it on a normal curve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s curve though, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yea, it\u2019s a normalization. There\u2019s one way to roll a 3. There\u2019s one way to roll and 18. There\u2019s three possible combinations that get you to 17. There\u2019s three possible combinations to get you to 2. So\u2026 and there\u2019s 27 and 27 for 10 and 11. So the mean is 10.5. The standard deviation is 2.97. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: So it almost acts like a normal\u2026 like a\u2026 what\u2019s the word for it? How a very normal distribution works, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: This is like a strictly normal distribution essentially. It\u2019s like the literal definition of the area under the curve is one and it goes up. There are reflection points around the cup and then reflection points going downward. And it\u2019s perfectly even.  And it\u2019s not too high a peak. It\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">along this thing. So the funny thing with dices rolls is there is nothing beyond third deviation. You get into the third deviation, there\u2019s no 0.003% chance that you roll something other than an 18. Like over an 18, it\u2019s impossible. You never roll a 19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Well, unless the die just stands on its corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yea, sure. Unless that happens somehow at which case we call it a tipper when we roll the entire thing. So we have rules for these things. So all I have to do is take apart these two tables in the basement and rebuild a 4 by 5 table so 4 by\u2026 instead of 5 by 6 which is how we\u2019ll probably\u2026 yea, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">5 by 6 and half from that one. Just hobble together from the two tables the old man left. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: The guy that lived there before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Yea. But if I can take those apart and build something else, I would like that very much. Put a little shelf under there so I can store my buildings in there. I\u2019ve built shit before. I\u2019ve built tables. I mean, basic break room tables but that\u2019s all I\u2019m looking to do. So I can do it. And I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">Vince down there. I go, \u201cHey Vince, come on over. I want to build this thing.\u201d And that\u2019ll be fun. We can build that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">One of them I\u2019m thinking about right now the premise is like simplifying. A thousand dollars, $1,500 worth of magic cards is great. That\u2019s half a mortgage payment. Taxes coming up very soon. I need to see what that bill is like. It\u2019s going to be interesting for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Oh, wait. You\u2019ll get a refund?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Well, I hope so. But I got on that settlement which counts as a 1099 and that was like $22,000 so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563419\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: So you got to pay taxes on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yea. And I\u2019m like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Oh, they don\u2019t take it out automatically. They just give it to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: They gave it to me so yea, that\u2019s going to hurt. I\u2019ll probably put in for an extension and be like I\u2019ll pay that this year sometime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s how they structured it. That makes sense. They just give it to you in a lump sum, though. And then you have to pay the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Exactly. So I\u2019ve got to deal with that.  And yea, so that\u2019s my life. But I\u2019m trying to simplify. I\u2019m trying to get rid of these magic cards and get through all these like plastic bits and get rid of all these extra board games I\u2019m never going to play. And I can\u2019t really store them where they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">out of the way if I can\u2019t just get to them. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">And I know it helps me avoid doing math which is funny. And part of the difficulty is this is I\u2019m starting to realize I\u2019m getting into math and there\u2019s parts that are actually pretty easy. I\u2019m like I understand this stuff and quickly then the other part of me is, well, but remember there\u2019s stuff that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">can surprise. Sometimes this gets\u2026 so you get them way harder, right? And I don\u2019t want to see you there on Monday morning cramming the first half of Chapter 7 and take two tests that day one on six and one of seven.  So be like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Well, that I think is some of the challenge of math to anybody, to you, is the unpredictability of it. Like you don\u2019t know what\u2026 like in Chapter 7, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming your way. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to challenge you and feel hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yea, and I was thinking about Chapter 6 in general. I still need to review it I think but to be like\u2026 because I got a B but I\u2019m not here to get a B. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, how good are you at stats?\u201d Oh, about 82% of the time I\u2019m right. Because sometimes I\u2019m way off because I mean, that\u2019s what happens <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">during those things. I\u2019d rather be, \u201cHow are you at stats?\u201d Oh, 91.57 because I would\u2019ve been 100 had I not taken a strategic (inaudible at 00:16:55).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems to me like it\u2019s similar to like doing work. It\u2019s like you need to kind of continually go over and over it again until you get all the bugs out because you go through\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well, right. This is process I\u2019m doing here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s realizing which tools to use at which points. Which equation is useful here? What am I trying to determine? Math dude, math. It\u2019s like once that\u2019s done all of a sudden I\u2019ve got a degree. And I sitting, I\u2019m like for a year now I could\u2019ve been getting occasional voice work for a year easily. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">And yet and here I remain. And here I remain. I was under that super angst-y PEEPtinis (inaudible at 00:17:53) do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: So two years ago there\u2019s my friends Jim and Derek. They hold a PEEPtinis party where they make a martini and they put a PEEP in it. (inaudible at 00:18:06) I can\u2019t drink one of those. I\u2019ll drink something else. But still every year they have a competition for who can make the best PEEP related <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">art. And a couple years ago I was like, oh, I\u2019ll never enter this. And I\u2019m like, oh, I got idea for home. OK, Ursula I\u2019m going to write a poem for this thing. And it\u2019s like\u2026 (inaudible at 00:18:30) was like, OK, was that seven minutes? Cool. Check it out. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563419\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Oh, I think you told me about that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: I told you that one. That was funny. And people really liked it and it won which was fun. But it was about like the experience of being a PEEP in a package that everyone else has eaten but you. The title was Everyone is Dead but Me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Everybody\u2026 (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: And so I\u2019ve written a sequel to it this year called Why Can\u2019t I Die? And it\u2019s about that same PEEP and I\u2019m in a garbage bag who\u2019s been there for however long and that experience of internal darkness.  And\u2026 but there\u2019s this whole point in it where he says, \u201cI pray, I hope, I beg that there be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">some force, benign and kind, willing to free me from this eternity. Yet here I remain.\u201d And it\u2019s funny stuff. I\u2019m not trying to be serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">But then so at the same time it\u2019s that sort of thing like, \u201cI wish I was something where like free me from this.\u201d And it goes on and talks about, \u201cAfter almost dying, I was grateful that I was spared. Should I have begged for death? I wonder this in the endless dark. If there is meaning in being sorry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">then I am. Yet here I remain.\u201d And I like that idea. It\u2019s super angst-y and hilarious is the other thing.  But like stupidly so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s both, though. It\u2019s humorous but like deeply\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Yet here I remain. Well, it\u2019s that thing, right? It\u2019s the, I seem to be suffering. There seems to be no point to it. There\u2019s no God to save me. There\u2019s no sort of punishment other than this. No sort of reprieve from it. I don\u2019t know what I did if there was a rule that I broke. Was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">there a rule that I broke or is this just the way it is? (pause) So then we publish on my (inaudible at 00:20:46). Just put it out there. Go like shitty poems from a guy who writes shitty poems by Lou Jacobs, a book of shitty poems. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s shitty about\u2026 what\u2019s shitty about it? What do you see shitty about it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s\u2026 I mean, they\u2019re just like\u2026 these things are like\u2026 this one took me 13 minutes to write which is twice the length of the second one but not nearly as long as the first one and twice the length of the time to write it. Should I have begged for death? What a question. Was that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">not a mistake that I didn\u2019t want to die? (pause) And if so, I apologize. I do. I\u2019m sorry. I wish I chosen differently. But there it is. But then there\u2019s nothing. There is no response so just continuous dark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">Anyways, I\u2019m looking forward to reading that to a group of people who I\u2019m sure will find it funny. They found the first one very funny. It was (inaudible at 00:21:53) almost a unanimous vote. I voted for Brianne because she did PEEPton Abbey which she took a bunch of PEEPS and built like a little Downton <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">Abbey out of gingerbread and then like the little paper clothes on each PEEP to give them outfits for characters of Downton Abbey.  I\u2019m like that was a good\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: A diorama.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yea, that was amazing. I voted for that and I was the only one because everyone else voted for me. I was, \u201cBrianne, I\u2019m sorry. Yours was amazing. I loved it.\u201d But we\u2019ll see what happens. I\u2019m thinking a lot about God and shit so after we\u2019ll do the thing with equally lengthy outcomes. What I like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">to do so that can be funny. (pause) The people who use God language, like even my good friend Adam regarding who (inaudible at 00:22:57) posts like oh yea, faith is pretending to know things that you don\u2019t know. And Adam is like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not pretending as much as believing things which have no factual <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D12\">evidence. There\u2019s a subtle difference.\u201d And I haven\u2019t responding because like there isn\u2019t that subtle of a difference.

What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: He says, \u201cFaith isn\u2019t pretending to know things you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s believing in things without factual evidence.\u201d These are equivalent in the end. These two things are equivalent. You believe in things. You claim to know things that you don\u2019t know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: \u2026and you can\u2019t know. You cannot possibly know and the reason you believe\u2026 and again, the reason you believe these things because you were told them as a child. Like and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the sum. That\u2019s the summation of what makes a Catholic, more Catholics. Other Catholics make other Catholics. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\"> And it\u2019s the same for all of them. It\u2019s the simple argument. It\u2019s like I\u2019m a Christian. I\u2019m a devout Christian. Be a devout Muslim where you\u2019re born in like the Middle East. You can be a devout Hindu. You were born in India.

Well, Sam Harris happens to be writing a book on it. It\u2019s called a Guide to Spirituality Without Religion.

In some way it\u2019s like you think more about\u2026 you\u2019ve got a connection with weed that\u2019s so much more like this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">\u201cI think about it. It\u2019s not conflicted to me at all. It comes readily to mind. It\u2019s easy as opposed to food.

In my younger days it was always a crapshoot. Like what were you going to get? Who was going to sell it to you? Who had some? What were they charging for it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Harold or was it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: It was Harold. And before that it was just get what you can, right? Here in high school, who has weed? Oh, I don\u2019t know. The ones whose parents will let them have some, that\u2019s who. (pause) I still remember that day [] comes to pick us all up in the van. It\u2019s after we had been in (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D1\">00:30:38) was acting all cool and chill. Trying not to be like oh, we\u2019re fine with weed. Fine with weed. And Logan buys some weed, takes it under his shirt. His mom comes to pick us up. Get in the van. He\u2019s in the front seat. He takes it out between the two seats and shows it to her. And she\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D2\">is, \u201cOh Logan.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cThat will not be enough for all of you,\u201d because he was throwing a good party that night. He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m just really kind of feel like it\u2019s going to go on.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cAll right, are you sure?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">And it\u2019s funny. I tell that story as if I were there because that\u2019s how I told it after he told it to me. The story I incorporated myself into. And I told you I used to do that. Just his memory was shit. So it wasn\u2019t good anyway but he was also smoking weed. And I think part of them also was just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">\u201cI smoke weed. I don\u2019t have to remember shit.\u201d And that\u2019s some sort of excuse that he had. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a nice memory to make in yours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: Sure. I did that with a lot of my social memories because I wasn\u2019t invited (inaudible at 00:31:49) for the most part except for that one part where we all went to the barn and smoked weed and dropped acid (inaudible at 00:31:55) house. That was a fucking bomb. That\u2019s probably one of the best <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201431\">parties I\u2019ve ever been to in my entire life. And I think that\u2019s the sort of the party you can only have when you\u2019re a teenager in high school. It\u2019s a beautiful spring night. There\u2019s this barn that\u2019s made up with music and there\u2019s couches up there in the loft. And Latrey Hughes (sp?) is out on the lawn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: The wood?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: [] (sp?) in out on the lawn lying there surrounded by these lawn mowers. There are all these broken down lawn mowers which I wasn\u2019t positive were real. But at the same time it didn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: Oh, because you were tripping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: And I remember her ass was so perfect. I was looking at it. Oh, I reached out and so I poked it. She was like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just want to poke it.\u201d And then so I mean that was weird. I mean, hell, was hot as hell.  There was a point in which I thought the ground <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B1\">was vertical which was very interesting and quite a night, quite a night, my first psychedelic experience. Amazing that the world could be so different. And same\u2026 (crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: You can change it or it could be changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: It can be changed. The perception of it can be changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: Powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: Very much so. And the realization we could do more of these things later is that everything that you experience comes from you. These are all things\u2026 so if you are afraid, if you are worried, this is not the experience for you. If you\u2019re like, \u201cOh no, I got a bad trip.\u201d So, well, if you\u2019re really <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201531\">worrying about a bad trip, then maybe but likely you\u2019re not. Just get some music you like.  So hang out some place you feel comfortable and safe and just be like, what\u2019s decent or fun?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20152-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20152-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563419\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yea, because there\u2019s a sense that you\u2019re going to\u2026 not only that the bad\u2026 that the trip will be bad but that it\u2019ll be worse than your current perception.

I was pretty sure my fire in the back and had to drink so much water because of all the cobwebs in my throat. That was a pretty negative experience and it was only a few hours at the time. But I remember thinking at that point, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201571\">it\u2019s like this is the problem with tripping is once you\u2019re tripping, you\u2019re tripping. You\u2019re there for eight hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s\u2026 it does control you for about eight hours at least or at least for more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yea, it\u2019s like this is what is happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Yea. You\u2019re not getting out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: The things you see are very likely not real. You will experience things and make connections that aren\u2019t correct. You may experience anesthesia and other things. You may have shared hallucinations which as I come to look at them later on are group influenced hallucinations. Like, oh my God, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F1\">I\u2019m seeing the Tikiman. Oh my God, where is the Tikiman. Oh, they\u2019re doing those things. Oh, there they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s suggestive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: It\u2019s suggestive and as we told the stories to each other, it becomes this more realistic thing we perceive or believe we perceive. And that was the last time I remember. It was amazing, just absolutely amazing. Beautiful, clean stuff made by a chemistry student who graduated 20 years ago, 30 <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201631\">years ago. And it was called Purple Jesus because his painting was a big purple Jesus on a cross and it cut up into tiny little pieces. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: That was the paper that he put it on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Yea, on a tiny little piece of paper you put under your tongue for at least a half hour they say. It doesn\u2019t take that long really. But whatever, it\u2019s under your tongue. And a half hour, all of a sudden things get a little different. Like the third time I dropped acid my friend Oliver and a <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201671\">bunch of other frat people (inaudible at 00:36:33) and they\u2019re like, \u201cIt\u2019s not kicking in yet. Not kicking in.\u201d And then we go to McDonald\u2019s and I\u2019m getting my straw and it\u2019s a little bigger than the straws that I\u2019m used to. And I look at Oliver. I go, \u201cOliver isn\u2019t this straw just a little bit bigger?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201672\">And he starts to giggle. And I\u2019m like this is it. It\u2019s beginning. This is\u2026 at one point during that trip, I said something or did something so offensive that everyone left the room. I have no idea what it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: No one told you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: Well, the host was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe the way you\u2019re behaving.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cEveryone has left because of you.\u201d And the problem is like maybe that\u2019s just what he perceived. He was tripping, too. I don\u2019t know. My friend turned into Donald the Tiger briefly. There was game that we would play. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">There was a very complex game being played. The rules to which no one would tell me but very clearly there was a game being played. There was no game, right? The rules that I perceived were made up as they went along. A lot of it was funny so directly in the moment right now, right now, right now, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B2\">right now, right now. Staying in that moment forever because we were listening to fucking Phish, right? Because what else would you listen to when you\u2019re tripping except for the Grateful Dead or Pink Floyd? And listen to Phish and they\u2019re doing\u2026 it was a live concert.  Because of course they\u2019re live <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B3\">concerts. And it was in one of those jazzy like\u2026 we finished the song ten minutes ago but now we\u2019re just fucking jerking off with music.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2016A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563419\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D\">THERAPIST: The music is off but you\u2019re just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016F\">CLIENT: Well, no.

And I\u2019m following the notes and I\u2019m on a roller coaster that follows the notes in space. And then the music just stops. They go from long high pitched note. That was the end of it and I\u2019m cast off the rail into space. It\u2019s floating through space. There\u2019s a moment where <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201731\">I\u2019m like, oh no.

And this\u2026 yea, what happens if this is where I am? And this giant scroll unrolls and forming and said everything is OK right now. (pause)  And I was like, yea, try to keep that moment. And I\u2019ve tried to keep that moment from time to time like, yea, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s\u2026 everything is OK <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201771\">right now, right? There is worry in the future but Sam Harris says it quite well. There\u2019s always now. The past is memory. There\u2019s a thought arising the present as in the future.

Who the fuck do you think you are? I\u2019m waking every fucking day, (inaudible at 00:40:03). So I also saw Frozen the other night.

It\u2019s such a wonderful film.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20195\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Kids, you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20197\">CLIENT: The first Disney princess where it\u2019s two princesses. One of the rare ones it doesn\u2019t have with a wedding with a story that\u2019s not about a love between a boy and a girl.  Although there is like a fraction of budding romance. That\u2019s we never get really past that by the end of the film. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201971\">like, oh, they\u2019re probably going to develop some sort of relationship later. As opposed to like, oh, now we\u2019re in love forever. There\u2019s a whole like reference to she meets this guy. She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry him.\u201d And then she\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t marry him.\u201d She goes, \u201cYou meet him today. You can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201972\">marry a man you just met today,\u201d which is a total disregard of all Disney princess films.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563419\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20199\">THERAPIST: Is it a Disney?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yea. This is. It\u2019s their new\u2026 they\u2019ve realized the time has changed like Brave. It\u2019s Frozen. This is the way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019D\">THERAPIST: So what is Frozen? What\u2019s it about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F\">CLIENT: Frozen is\u2026 there\u2019s these two princesses, one of which is an ice sorceress. The other which is a little sister and she loves to play\u2026 they love to play together. She\u2019ll make like snowbanks and snowmen and she\u2019ll like to\u2026 just like make all this ice stuff and the other one will play on it.  And\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F1\">but there\u2019s an accident. She hits her on the head with like an ice beam and knocks her unconscious. They have to take her to the trolls and the trolls are like, \u201cOh, good thing you hit her on the head.\u201d So they fix her but they\u2019re like\u2026 and this is the dumb part. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat we\u2019ll just do is <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F2\">remove all memory of magic from the little girl\u2019s head so she won\u2019t remember that her sister has magic.\u201d So then she won\u2019t want to play magic with her sister which is actually the dumbest fucking thing you should do and your parents go along with it. But her parents teach to like conceal because her <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F3\">emotions make it more difficult to\u2026 (crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A1\">THERAPIST: The older one still has magic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yea, the older one does. And her emotions make it hard to control. And so when she\u2019s near her sister she\u2019s worried that if she feels\u2026 if she loses control, she\u2019ll hurt her sister. So she grows up ignoring her sister over the years and almost automatically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">And there\u2019s this\u2026 and the great premise of the movie actually is that the parents die and it\u2019s Elsa\u2019s turn to take over as queen, right? And they have this big event for the first time ever. Elsa always wears gloves so she doesn\u2019t like freeze stuff she touches and there\u2019s a moment of the ceremony she <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A51\">had to hold like a ball and a scepter without her gloves on. She has to really concentrate not to let the panic of the audience freeze these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A7\">And there\u2019s a whole thing that goes on and it was at the grand ball which like loses it, she loses it. She just freezes a bunch of shit and people are like, \u201cHoly shit. Sorceress. Oh my God.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d She bails. And as she storms up the mountain, she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s frozen the <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A71\">entire area. She has no idea she\u2019s doing this. But then she has the great song which is like the title song, the Let It Go song, which is where she\u2019s\u2026 the best part is she\u2019s\u2026 for years she\u2019s hidden this power. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">And she keeps telling herself the mantra. Her father was always like, conceal it, don\u2019t feel it. It\u2019s like this whole thing she does. Don\u2019t let them know. And there\u2019s a breakthrough moment where she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, now they know.\u201d So she\u2019s like, \u201cFuck it. I\u2019m in ice sorceress.\u201d So she\u2019s like doing all <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A91\">this\u2026 she builds a fucking ice castle. It\u2019s fucking great. And the best part of the movie is the other princess is immediately like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re an ice sorceress. OK. I\u2019m going to come find you. I\u2019m not mad or afraid. I get it.

I mean, that\u2019s the way I\u2019d characterize it but it seems like\u2026 but the way you describe it, it seems like a rush of feelings when you set forth to do something like study, put a voice reel together the doubts, the anxieties, uncertainties <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E31\">that aren\u2019t just abstract things that people encounter.
