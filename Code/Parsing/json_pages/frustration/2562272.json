(pause) I\u2019m really tired. (pause) I don\u2019t know what this week\u2019s going to be like. (pause) They asked me to be on this \u2013 religious committee. Which I \u2013 is actually a real thing, even though it really doesn\u2019t sound like something that has any meaning at all.  (pause) (background noise)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">But basically it is sort of to talk about like (pause) religious education for adults in the church, and how to be better at that. So the first the meeting that I was able to go to last night, and it was really nice; like really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, especially since I didn\u2019t really want to go. It\u2019s not a well time to do it. (pause) That is something that I am looking forward to being a part of and I think it will be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Well good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)  (pause) Yeah, I\u2019m just really tired. (pause) Papa left his bike by the clinical office at my friends\u2019 apartment. Or if he thinks he did it, I\u2019d never actually asked her if she\u2019s seen them, because like I would have recognized them, so it occurred to me that they were going there. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I (pause) I had a bad dream that woke me up in the middle of the night last night. (pause) So it sort of surprises me, but on the other hand, then I get to sleep for like two or three more hours; that\u2019s always a nice night. Or worse is waking up like two minutes before your alarm goes off.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Yeah, I really don\u2019t know what to talk about. (pause) I really need to get new socks. (pause) (inaudible at 00:04:33). It\u2019s while they\u2019re awesome, I feel like I need new socks. (pause) James would say, \u201cWhy did you put on a different pair?\u201d And just like, I just didn\u2019t know; I\u2019d be like, \u201cThey\u2019re cold.\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And I\u2019m \u2013 I am very ready for James to at least be applying to jobs.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I feel like I\u2019m sure that my being in the hospital has made him feel more like he needs to \u2013 like me to stay at (school) (ph), and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very happy about that. And I think that sort of makes it harder for him to get off the ground. (pause) I don\u2019t know what to tell him.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">It\u2019s like, I feel like the current situation is a really bad one for me.

(pause)  (pause) Yeah. (pause) I am trying to be patient. It\u2019s not like I actually want to move, but (pause) I think (pause) I (inaudible at 00:08:11), so I think I\u2019m going to work more hours for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">(inaudible at 00:08:19) for a couple more \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Oh. I don\u2019t think I know them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Okay, the chief of staff at Kim\u2019s office is going to be out on maternity leave, so Kim\u2019s going to be active chief of staff. And she said, they sort of said that she didn\u2019t have to come in more days, but she really does have to come in more days. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">So she asked whether I wanted the hours, and if I don\u2019t want them, like there\u2019s somebody else who could do it. But I think I could; I could certainly see and all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: When will you be working?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562272\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know yet; Monday or Friday. You know I want to do it, but I\u2019m not willing to \u2013 like I need to work around like these appointments, and also figure out how to keep doing the tutoring, because I don\u2019t want to drop that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: So probably Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, let me know if changing our Monday or Friday times would make things easier, and I can always stay on the lookout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Okay; thanks.

It\u2019s still hard. I think it\u2019s getting easier though. (pause) For awhile, I was taking a lot of my energy (extension) (ph), (pause) and it still is, but maybe not quite as much. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">And I\u2019m trying to be, I don\u2019t know, optimistic, but I just feel so beat. (pause) (pause) It just occurred to me that I haven\u2019t talked about that in like two weeks. (pause) I haven\u2019t thought about it. (pause) I think like most of friends knew I was in the hospital; my friends who I know from (school) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">(ph). (pause) I talk to them. (pause) It was like \u2013 really awkward, it was like we were having a conversation about something else entirely; it was almost like time for us to go our separate ways; we were having a weird like [g time] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">I was like, \u201cOh, by the way,\u201d (laughter) \u201cit happened.\u201d (laughter) (pause) It was like in \u2013 there\u2019s a hyperbole and a half comment, of course, that \u201cTanya, you\u2019re just trying to figure out how to tell people that she might be suicidal.\u201d And she like goes through all of these \u2013 she\u2019s like, \u201cThis is a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">(stupidly) (ph) awkward conversation to have.\u201d And so one of the options that she puts forward is like shout it, and then run away. (laughter) (pause) I think knock joke would be one. (laughter) (pause) Yeah, it\u2019d be. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Things with James are pretty okay in the day to day. (pause) We did talk for awhile yesterday about the sort of e-mail updates that he sent to my family. (pause) So like, we did a pretty good job there; it was hard, but like we I think both wanted to talk about it with Dr. Jannis (sp?) and we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">just didn\u2019t get there. So we just sort of talked about it afterwards. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">Yeah, we just like [beat the job] (ph) listening to each other, and saying (pause) yeah, as he said like have any space for both of us to get upset. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: How was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)  (pause) I\u2019m really excited about the weather. (pause) Yeah. I\u2019m just really excited about being able to go outside with the kids again. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Speaking of more space making it easier between people. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) Exactly. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I think maybe there is (pause) a way that that\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re wanting with me in a way now as well, in that (pause) I imagine you feel (pause) like some pressure to be talking about how bad things are, or like these bad feelings. And then they\u2019re sort of, [what it is to like not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">off to work] (ph); you don\u2019t want to. And (pause) I don\u2019t know that I could be wrong, but my hunch is you feel that little bit of split between you and me, where it\u2019s sort of like what came up yesterday, where it feels like some of the pressure comes from me to be talking about the deep dark awfulness.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562272\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">Or that you\u2019ll be talking about something else, and I\u2019ll say something that points back to it. And that (pause) it feels like if you had a little more breathing room, (pause) in that way, you feel more at ease. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t feel particularly cramped this morning. (pause) I guess it feels like, I feel pressured to be talking, and it feels like every avenue of conversation\u2019s just going to lead bad places. And I sort of know that\u2019s going to happen; (pause) somehow really going to hurt.  (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I also get the sense when you say that it feels more as though that comes from you than from like some pressure from me, or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. (pause) It\u2019s just why \u2013 (pause) it\u2019s just where I am right now. (pause) I\u2019m just so tired. Like (pause) yeah, I\u2019ve just been so exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(pause) And as I tried really hard not to be, (pause) I tried really hard to structure things that this wouldn\u2019t happen, and didn\u2019t make it that far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Like I cancelled everything I had to do, and tried to be able to rest this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Oh, with your dad coming in town? (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t think I did a very good job, but I\u2019m just like, that was the hope. (pause)  (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m trying to figure what the other things that you \u2013 (pause) like had on your schedule to do, that you said you that you cancelled.

I guess I\u2019m just frustrated and feel like \u2013 I feel like there are too many things that I couldn\u2019t cancel. (pause)  (pause) I feel like I can\u2019t, (pause) but I feel like I just need to not cancel things. I don\u2019t know where like the completely arbitrary deadline is like, I need to be better <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">now. But (pause)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Well I can see why. I mean probably most people are emotional is that you\u2019re totally wiped out. I mean (pause) your having been in the hospital, and then work last week, and then seeing your dad is totally exhausting and overwhelming a lot of the time, among other things certainly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">But that, and then yesterday, this was my impression, was no picnic either with a (inaudible at 00:25:29), I mean towards the end, and you know, then you had another appointment with Dr. Jannis, then moved to having conversation, which is great that it went well.

(pause) I\u2019m guessing, but I\u2019m not sure you think about it this way for things you\u2019ve been through, maybe recently, maybe longer ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Certainly there\u2019s been a lot recently, and that that feeling that for you usually doesn\u2019t bring with it the sense that things are going to get better, or there\u2019s even much of a point. (pause) It\u2019s just grief. (pause) And it\u2019s about you. And that\u2019s at odds I think with the sense that I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">you\u2019re supposed to be doing something, or renewing something ahead. (pause) Or doing some work. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">I guess that\u2019s sort of my impression that maybe has you feel you\u2019re letting me down.

I mean, you know, I don\u2019t think I really stated anything. At the same time, there\u2019s either like when I do make comments, or point things out, (pause) I can see how <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">there\u2019s a way in which in itself, that sort of puts a certain burden on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">I mean not in a bad way exactly, or not like badly intended, but (pause) maybe it gives you something to think about, or something to look at, or to doing something while sitting, right? There\u2019s a kind of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Sometimes I can see what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I guess what I had in mind is, you may be right about what I\u2019m trying to do, and you may be right (pause) when I am aware of trying to do something, or when I\u2019m not. But you might not be ready. (pause) In other words your idea of what I\u2019m trying to do might not actually be what I\u2019m trying to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You know, it might come from your expectations.
