I\u2019m not fiddling around this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Our plant outside is, it looks healthy it just wants to be growing somewhere else. [Laughs] Honestly there was a bunch of large houseplants around, which I sort of surreptitiously watered over the last month. The kids really like watering the plants. Sharon (ph) of course wants to carry a big <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">thing of water and is insistent that she carry it by herself, [laughs] which I mean water is spilled on the floor but it\u2019s okay. And she\u2019ll stand and she\u2019ll point at the spill and she says pill, pill for spill and insists that we clean it up right away and I say dude, I don\u2019t care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I\u2019m tired anyway. [Pause] Everyone had a lot of energy yesterday, which was good but oh my goodness. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s getting warm. Yes, just life is better when we can go outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">James turned in his thesis last week. Still, he there\u2019s an XQC (ph) which is a web convert pretty recently, like a few months ago, to pretty much characterize what he\u2019s been doing exactly which is a small problem and there is a task that is somewhat tedious. So he writes in code to automate the task <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">and you project that you\u2019ll work more when you start figuring out the bugs in the code and then you\u2019ll work a lot less because it\u2019ll automate the task. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But actually what happens is that the task, fixing the code just makes more and more and more work and you never get to actually work on the problem anymore. And that is exactly what happened to James. Yes, so he\u2019s talking about trying to fix this code so that he can get back to writing the paper. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to reconcile that picture of what James\u2019s working on with any kind of urgency in our moving. Doesn\u2019t look to me like we\u2019re going anywhere any time soon. But I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Yes, I was talking to Joshua the other day and I realized the last time we talked almost a year ago I was sort of telling him the exact same thing that James\u2019s about to start applying for jobs and we might be moving pretty soon. Did help a lot to talk with James I guess a week or so ago and say look <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">this has made things really hard for me and he said Olivia I\u2019m sorry about that. That helped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I\u2019m rereading one of my favorite books for the second time in I think less than a month. But before then I hadn\u2019t read it for two years because Amanda borrowed my copy and so I was never getting it back. It was good, very soothing. It also was sort of a well maybe we\u2019ve sort of been expecting this cultural <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">shift for the last hundred years and it hasn\u2019t really happened because it\u2019s set in well 80 years. It\u2019s set in 1935, it\u2019s written in 1935 and it\u2019s about this women\u2019s college in Oxford. And so one of the things that they talk about is women\u2019s careers and basically balancing marriage and the intellectual <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">life, so obviously it\u2019s one that I really like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">But it is f***king amazing how many attitudes and sort of problems in there are just pretty much exactly the same. [Pause] The world of scholarship is going different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Than 80 years ago?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause] It\u2019s frustrating and timing-delayed. For someone who is as just very intelligent and quick as he is, he doesn\u2019t really adjust to new ideas at all, ever. Yes, so I at least not about the things that he cares about. Yes, so I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really got it in him to understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">that the department that he went through is not the same as the department that I went through. I don\u2019t, he sort of hears me out but I don\u2019t we have to have the same conversation every time because it doesn\u2019t work for him. And he\u2019ll sort of hear me out and then he\u2019ll sort of go back to talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">his teachers and what it was like when he was going through. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562490\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">And that it\u2019s not bad. It just happens to be painful for me right now. But, you know, this is the guy who\u2019s been talking for 10 years about the possibility of getting a dog, so. I think the last time he was here he told us he had put down his deposit at the assisted living facility in San Antonio. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">the place to be basically. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a nice spot but, yes. I used to go visit there when I was in high school because a couple who was friends with my grandparents, a New Testament professor and his wife, were there and so they\u2019d take me out to lunch periodically and it was really nice. Except <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">the food was wretched. I\u2019m really enjoying the company of these people, I\u2019m on my best behavior, and at 16 just I couldn\u2019t get the food down. I had enough manners to I think disguise that pretty well but I thought it was funny. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">So he had put this deposit down and he was talking about moving there in 10 years and he\u2019s probably in his late 60s, maybe early 70s but I think he went to Brown in the early 70s. I\u2019m trying to think how old that would make him. Anyway, late 60s, early 70s, and this time he said well I moved. So he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">just moved there. I said oh okay. In some ways I think that\u2019s a good spot for him. I think being a homeowner was very anxiety producing and stressful for him. He didn\u2019t buy a house until it was my senior year in high school so yes, about 10 years ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">And it\u2019s the kind of facility where you rent an apartment and you have the apartment as fixed price the whole time you\u2019re there. And then they basically just leave you alone for however long they can leave you alone and then as you need more care they provide more care. It\u2019s a really good spot but, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">yes. I don\u2019t know in some way I thought wow that\u2019s very sudden and soon and in some ways it was well you know actually it\u2019s probably exactly what he wants. More power to him other than getting a dog. But I think he could probably have a dog. I think that would be okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: When he gets better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yes. It might actually give him the self-confidence to take that plunge. To know there\u2019ll be back-up. [Pause] I can\u2019t see my parents ever entering the assisted living. Probably my mom will eventually but I don\u2019t know. The women in my family, my mom\u2019s side of the family, they live forever. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">they\u2019re healthy and independent forever I think. Yes, my great grandmother was 105 when she died. That might be an exaggeration but she was pretty old. And, yes, my grandmother I think is still living alone sort of doing her thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Papa is not going to stay with the hospital chaplaincy. I\u2019ll see what comes next. For him it\u2019s some combination of, I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s probably disliking the bullshit that inherently comes with it, with the territory and I think he really just likes being in charge on his way [inaudible at 00:18:57]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">And more generously I think he really misses being able to build long-term relationships with people. He says just coming in and just being, he gets to know somebody and then they\u2019re gone every time. That\u2019s hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562490\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Because they die or leave the hospital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Mostly they leave the hospital. And I think it\u2019s something that he\u2019s only just realizing that the process of being in a relationship with somebody while they\u2019re dying, going through that with them is the thing he\u2019s really, he\u2019s good at and likes. And so to have to not be able to be with people <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">and that all the way through that, to sort of develop a relationship with the understanding that it\u2019s not going to be long term I think is really hard for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: I see because people either go home or go to hospice for special therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. And I think it probably has to do with the types of places that he\u2019s working in. But I\u2019m sorry I think he should work in a hospice community but that\u2019s me. And then he gets into fights with his supervisor because, over ecumenical based stuff, because they don\u2019t want him to be too Episcopalian <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">except when it\u2019s something they like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">And he sort of says well if you\u2019re not going to let me wear, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the Priest collar because he doesn\u2019t like doing that, but he says if you\u2019re not going to let me pray from the Book of Common Prayer, talk about the things that are distinctive to my tradition, then don\u2019t ask me to distribute <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">ashes on Ash Wednesday because it\u2019s all about peace; you can\u2019t just pick things out. Which I both have sympathy with and reading between the lines I feel like you\u2019re probably being a little difficult. That stuff matters a lot but other stuff matters more I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Just that I think the integrity of one\u2019s traditions are important but I also think that the situation he\u2019s in is one of having to be very adaptable, to respond to different people\u2019s needs. And he\u2019s really good at doing that with patients but I suspect he\u2019s not as good at doing that with sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">of other chaplains and people who are in charge of him. And so yes, there\u2019s a point at which, I\u2019m not in there so I\u2019m just listening to what he\u2019s saying, but I think there\u2019s a point at which that, those conversations or those debates happen instead of the work that you\u2019re there to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">What I\u2019m seeing within Calvary right now is, or not actually specifically within Cavalry but within the Episcopal church is everybody\u2019s talking about the Internet and what that means for basically how do we do church with this new generation that is spiritual but not religious and doesn\u2019t really want <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">to go to church and is really into the Internet apparently? Everybody\u2019s talking about it and meanwhile people are actually using it and actually living their lives and having their fake lives and, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: You mean online?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Sorry I\u2019m not very clear here. I think I feel like, I feel like by the time we have a satisfactory answer to how we should relate to the Internet there will be another generation of people who use it completely differently. [Laughs] I don\u2019t know. James was saying yesterday that I was expressing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">surprise at I\u2019m always surprised when people haven\u2019t heard of XKCD because it\u2019s just something that everybody that I know within five years older or younger than I am just reads, even prominent science people, everybody reads it. And Kim (ph) had never heard of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562490\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">So I said there was an XKCD and that was sort of strange. So Kim (ph) never heard of it and I was expressing that surprise to James and he says well you know people 10 years older than us use the Internet differently. And people 10 years younger than us also seem to use the Internet pretty differently. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">So, I don\u2019t know. I think people just the tools have changed so much that they\u2019re afraid that people will fundamentally change and I just don\u2019t really think that happens as much as people think it does. I think people just need the same things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">They, yes they look different but I don\u2019t know. Also personally every time I hear a sermon about Facebook it makes me want to punch a wall. [Laughs] Maybe that\u2019s it. If you\u2019re talking about it that means you\u2019re not taking it for granted, which means that you\u2019ve already lost me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: That follows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Which means that now I have to sort of move into my communicating-with-people-who-aren\u2019t-on-the-same-page-as-me mode, which is not the point. In a holy unsurprising turn of events I\u2019m the only person under the age of 40 in this Christian formation group. And I feel a responsibility to my generation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">I don\u2019t like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">And in this book that we all read there\u2019s a chapter about how people\u2019s lives are different today. And it\u2019s sort of the same refrain that you hear everywhere. Increasingly fragmented relationships, short term rather than long term relationships, people move around all the time, people spend most of their <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">time online, loss of connection, nobody\u2019s really having authentic relationships anymore, blah, blah, blah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">I feel like when I hear so many different people giving me that narrative and it\u2019s so at odds with the way that I relate to the world and with the people that I know both online and in person. And they seem so certain that there\u2019s not a whole lot of data there, or typically not a whole lot of data and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">the data that there is, it sort of looks like they interviewed 300 people called a donation wide trend. I feel like they probably, I don\u2019t know, I just start to say what are you trying to achieve with this narrative rather than how true is the narrative. And that\u2019s screwy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">It says my history is good. There was a classical author who wrote about how the young don\u2019t respect their elders or have any time for physical things. I don\u2019t remember who it was but there is a classical author basically this is what\u2019s happening; society\u2019s going to hell [laughs] because of the young. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: This is not a new thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: No. There\u2019s another XKCD. There was a whole list of media quotes about the increasing disconnection of people who pay attention to this new technology all the time instead of talking to each other and it was right after newspapers became a big (ph) thing. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen when my mom can\u2019t take care of herself. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with her mom. I think she\u2019s still speaking with some of her children but she\u2019s got five so those are good odds. She\u2019s certainly not in contact with my mom as far as I know. I\u2019m pretty sure Margaret\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">not in contact with her. I think Marla (sp) who I think is the healthiest of that bunch is I think she\u2019s sort of in brief well distanced loving conversations. Like you go and you visit and then you go home. It\u2019s just so sad. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562490\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re also somewhat, I think today, a bit frustrated with old people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: [Laughing] A little bit, yes. I get frustrated when I saw over that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: They need to get it. They get the wrong things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: It\u2019s always frustrating to me to realize that I can only actually be half of a conversation. [Laughs] I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m not, if I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being heard by somebody I always think well I\u2019m just not saying it right. I just have to claim it in a way that they can hear. And I\u2019m pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">good at that but sometimes that doesn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t always do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: I do wonder if there are things that you are saying to me that I am not yet getting. [Pause] I don\u2019t mean that those are, I\u2019m not literally getting the sense of what you say; I think I am. But there\u2019s something about how you\u2019re feeling and where you\u2019re coming from that I\u2019m not picking up <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">on or I haven\u2019t quite put my finger on or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Nothing comes to mind. Well this is frustrating to me to be a young person still. I don\u2019t actually feel that young, I really don\u2019t. But I don\u2019t know. I should go back to teaching. I don\u2019t get in the middle of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">My grandmother is on Facebook. I feel maybe I should swear less and then I decided that I didn\u2019t care that much. I don\u2019t know in some ways she and my grandfather are really interesting cool people. I never really knew that until after my grandfather died. Now I feel like, honestly I feel like if I actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">spent any time with her that would not, she would not seem like a very interesting and cool person to me. It\u2019s more easy now. She\u2019s just so mean. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">I\u2019m never going to visit her. When my grandfather was dying and, he had Parkinson\u2019s so it\u2019s a long time coming but at the same time they were married for 50 years and he was her whole life. But so she\u2019s playing online scrabble with a friend and she\u2019s cheating. [Laughs] And through the whole scenario <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">we say are you supposed to be doing that? And she says oh well she does it too. My point here is I know that she does it too; it\u2019s fine. But both, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">So they talk a lot about the spiritual but not religious folks, talked a lot about this the last meeting at church, and I said well okay when I hear I\u2019m spiritual but not religious, what I hear it I want to have a relationship with God but I don\u2019t want to give the church a chance to hurt me again. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">I think that we have a lot of most people that I know who aren\u2019t interested in being in church have a pretty good reason for that. And so we should pay attention to that. And that was one where everybody sort of nodded and then it was like I hadn\u2019t said it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">Yes we don\u2019t want to, we being church people don\u2019t want to consider that people risk a lot in trying for that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562490\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: Like [inaudible at 00:40:34] flying the, what is it, Black Oak (ph) sort of connection speaking in the real world or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Apathy and selfishness against people?

[Pause] It\u2019s sort of surprising to hear that James, or not James, that Geoffrey had moved into a living home. I just, in some ways I don\u2019t think of him as being elderly at all. In some ways but it\u2019s not because I think of him as being young it\u2019s more like he\u2019s never been young. He was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">50 when he was 15 probably. He has not changed at all in the time that I\u2019ve known him, which I\u2019ve known him since I was 14 so. He\u2019s always been about to get a dog.
