He\u2019s like, \u201cThis is awful.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is awful.\u201d And so I finally get it off of him and for a week he didn\u2019t get a collar. And Ginny is like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll go get him another collar right away.\u201d Because the next day she went and got another <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">collar because she felt for some reason that I was like really needing him to have the collar. And we discussed. She\u2019s like, \u201cMaybe we should get him one of Pepper\u2019s collars? It snaps together and it\u2019s adjustable more easily.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYea, that\u2019s a great idea.

It had like a path to like really injure him to take it off and get stuck. I\u2019m like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh, I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: \u201c\u2026this is even worse than the problem we had.

I don\u2019t care if he doesn\u2019t have a collar on for a week.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, well then I\u2019ll return this one.\u201d Like, \u201cGreat.\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">she got an adjustable one.

She can\u2019t turn her head <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">right and needs still to go to the chiropractor and like for the massage guy. I\u2019m like, \u201cGot to take care of it.

It\u2019s too many people. And some of them are cosplaying which is cool and some of them thank God for it. Cosplaying is a video game character whose belt doesn\u2019t come all the way down to the underwear like it should be. [0:10:18] It\u2019s just played very realistically.

So an amazing costume about this video game character. And other times you\u2019re like, oh, there\u2019s amazing costumes. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">incredibly sexy video game characters. Yes, you did. You will look incredibly sexy wearing things that shouldn\u2019t physically be possible. I know they\u2019re taped onto your body. That\u2019s the only way these things are holding up. And of course then you also see the men walking around in their G-string against <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B52\">their loin clothes and basically nothing else. [0:11:01] And you\u2019re like, OK.

That\u2019s one of the key things is people are always asking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">\u201cHow do I play the gay character?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, there\u2019s really two questions you could be asking. One is how do you play the stereotype that we\u2019ve come to know and love in comedy? If that\u2019s what you mean then just go watch some of that and imitate it. Flap your wrists around and go, \u2018Ah,\u2019 and use <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C12\">the voice of that. Appropriate various cultural things that aren\u2019t yours and play with them, whatever. That\u2019ll just be shit unless that\u2019s what is called for and the play is telling people.

That\u2019s the real question. \u201cHow do I play a homosexual character? I\u2019m doing a drama. I\u2019m not playing a flamboyant homosexual person but I am gay. How am I going to show the audience that I\u2019m gay?\u201d [0:12:59] It\u2019s like, well, you\u2019re not, right? It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">you don\u2019t play the fact that you\u2019re a man. You don\u2019t play that. That\u2019s just you should know what that is intrinsically. You don\u2019t play any of these things. You play the emotion, right? You play the reaction to the emotion that\u2019s coming across. That\u2019s what you play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">So if you\u2019re playing that you\u2019re in love, you should play that you\u2019re in love.

You\u2019d just be like\u2026 it would be just like it is now when you\u2019re in love with somebody else.

(inaudible at 0:13:52). So we went to see <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">Robocop together. And we go there and we\u2019re sitting there. It\u2019s pretty sparse. You don\u2019t expect a lot of couples to go to Robocop on Valentine\u2019s Day.

Is there like some rom-com you\u2019d rather go see right now or something?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cNo. But I don\u2019t know what my taste would be like if I were gay.\u201d But like, \u201cWhat would I be like if I were gay?\u201d You\u2019d be like you are <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB2\">now.

They\u2019re just like us and you can\u2019t tell which ones were which unless they\u2019re kissing each other. And then you can at least say, well, they\u2019re in the homosexual end of the spectrum. One of them might be bisexual or the other. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB1\">Who knows?

And it would add to its own value, too. It\u2019s simply <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">a category we put each other in.

That\u2019s like roughly 10% of a dominant species and the other 5% asexual or infertile or just so\u2026 or maybe a pedophile. So I don\u2019t know how it works. Roughly 15% of the population or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">the breeding pool, like that\u2019s nature. That\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world.

So, well, because it becomes the core to a person. Interesting. And how will we place value on what these things are and why will we value? It\u2019s one of those arguments that we\u2019ll make about keeping genes out of the species.

I square off. I stop caring about anybody and I walk forward. And pass through <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">them, right? And that\u2019s easy.

[0:20:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Well, they might.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: And what about the\u2026 yea, sure. Well, yea. But what about the crowds themselves being in that herd? What does that bring up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Assessment, constant assessment. Who is the weakest? Who are the threats? What is\u2026 what am I moving through, right? Can I move this guy? Is this guy aware that I\u2019m here? Is he going to gesture wildly? If he does, where will his elbow be, right? That sort of\u2026 I move through the crowd with that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">With the suspicion that nobody knows what the fuck they\u2019re doing, right? That they might gesture wildly and accidentally hit someone in the face, right? That people don\u2019t always look where they\u2019re going when they\u2019re changing direction. The rules of the crowd are clear but people will forget those and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F2\">try to move across or in the opposite direction. [0:21:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">And these are simple assessments and again, the constant checking of one\u2019s valuables. The trying to make sure you\u2019re navigating correctly. Which booth are we in? They all look so similar. Oh, good. These are the guys selling t-shirts. That means I\u2019m about to see the fox ass girl again. Here we go. Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">that\u2019s nice. That was good. Just a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: A little relief there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: \u2026little relief in the middle of the day. (pause) And I finally get out of that area, of the Expo area, where it\u2019s all just like video games and loud noises and people shoutcasting and just noise, noise, noise, noise. There\u2019s always useless noise, useless noise, useless noise. And it\u2019s like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">non-dramatized version of Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downey is Sherlock Holmes, right? [0:22:00] You know where like he goes to a restaurant and the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t see it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: Oh. He goes to a restaurant and he sits down. He\u2019s waiting for Watson. And it\u2019s just the moments he was waiting and just rapid fire shots. Everything is going on in the restaurant all the conversations, all the little details, everything happening, right because he\u2019s Sherlock Holmes. He sees everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: And all that\u2019s important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: So Sherlock Holmes also has the ability to see and process it all, right? And even at that, he pushed into his limits. Tries to shut down and he wants to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: He wants to turn it off but he can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Wow.

And so there\u2019s that aspect of it is that I am taking in all of the information. I don\u2019t process it as well as Sherlock Holmes does because he\u2019s a fictional character.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20124-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20124-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563457\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yea, that\u2019s exactly right.

Once you see it, you can\u2019t take it back. There was this game we used to play in college called Call of Cthulhu based off the works of H.P. Lovecraft who\u2019s a New England horror writer. So we play Call of Cthulhu and I love the game because after you played it a while you realize <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D1\">what the joke of the game is. It has those complicated rules, what you make your character and those were all just there to make, you the player, feel better. The game is a game where you are going to be killed. No matter what your human stats are or what abilities you\u2019re able to gain as a human being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D2\">will not be enough for demons and elder gods. Like it\u2019s just the rules are just to make you feel better as you watch your characters die, one after the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">But there\u2019s this idea that you have sanity points. And as you lose them you start to develop neuroses and phobias and stuff. [0:25:03] And it\u2019s on a scale from 1 to 100. And depending on where you\u2019re stats, start with a higher or lower sanity. And most will start around 70 to 80 sanity. No one is really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F1\">perfectly all there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: A hundred is the highest you can go for sanity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:25:13).

It\u2019s like too bad he\u2019s going to get eaten before he goes insane which what does that mean? So\u2026 but there was one guy, he was really dumb. He got his <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201531\">shotgun so we kept him with us. And he found this mask and he took it with him on one of these adventures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">And adventures later, so it\u2019s kind of getting kind of hairy.

And Rich, during the game, \u201cWhat mask are you talking about?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cThe mask we found at the place.\u201d And Rich was like, \u201cOh.\u201d And he goes through the books just looking through his notes <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201551\">and looking at his stuff. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I see.\u201d Roll some dice. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou see the following vision.\u201d [0:26:00] He explains like this vision of seeing like the creation of the universe by elder gods and he\u2019s like, \u201cOK, now take 80 points.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cEighty points of damage? That\u2019s so much <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201552\">damage. And these are 80 points of sanity. And it puts me at -40.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cAll right, so you\u2019re in a drooling heap in the corner.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20154-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20154-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563457\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Yea.

Ah, that\u2019s comforting. Work proves that everything is generally going to be fine. I did some work this weekend. I bought these dice, these custom dice they make for the war machine game I play, right? Where it\u2019s like (inaudible at 0:28:51) trolls. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201891\">So these dice are colored like the troll colors. It\u2019s like, OK, that\u2019s nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">Now Victor has complained that some of these dice are poorly designed and that they\u2019re weighted improperly such that they roll higher 6s more often than they should. [0:29:05] So I\u2019m like, OK Victor. That maybe Victor being the sour grapes but also Victor has an eye for probability in dice work and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B1\">he knows this stuff really well. So if he\u2019s noting that maybe a broken pattern, it\u2019s something they can look at. So I pull two random samples of 30 samples each of rolling dice. I calculate their mean and I calculate that mean against the Z-score. I turned that mean into a Z-score and I calculate that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B2\">against the curve and see with a 5% level of significance if those results are realistic or hypothesis or something. Yes, my dice are (inaudible at 0:29:44).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2018A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563457\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">CLIENT: Both of them were in one standard deviation.

So this is fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s well within the standard deviation.

So now given that so since each factory dice are different, we should test those. We should take a look and roll those. And it should be any three of the five that comes in the pack. It\u2019s all machine made. They are made by the same exact <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201931\">machine. They should all be exactly the same except for the defects which are thrown out of the lab, the ones that would be obvious to us. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Scott has been winning a lot more since he bought those special dice. So unlikely. Scott doesn\u2019t win very often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">THERAPIST: Yea, you get it off a TTest (inaudible at 0:30:41). A T-Test.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">CLIENT: Yea, exactly that. Exactly that. And the thing is, though, but it\u2019s a\u2026 it doesn\u2019t have to be a T. Just goes straight to Z-score because it\u2019s a normal distribution. Dice are straight on the normal curve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">CLIENT: So you can just take a sample 30 and you\u2019ll get the mean, the normal distribution as long as you pull from a normal distribution. [0:31:10] And there you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">CLIENT: You can do anything.

If they run the dice, if they did the test to see if they were fair dice after we modeled them, right?

That\u2019s like there\u2019s a way my dad taught me to add quickly. I add faster than I subtract which was funny because it took me years to realize that it\u2019s just addition in reverse. And division is multiplication in reverse. It\u2019s just like just do it the other way. And subtraction was an <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD1\">issue. In any case it doesn\u2019t matter. So he taught me how to add quickly with playing Blackjack. [0:32:59] He\u2019s like here\u2019s the numbers and numbers are symbols. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, see numbers as symbols. Add to this number. So if you get stuck, you count all the symbols up and that how the numbers are written.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Oh, yea.

So if you don\u2019t what seven and three are, just count them all up and we\u2019re at ten. It\u2019s like, right. Seven plus three is ten. I\u2019m like, oh, OK. That\u2019s what he said. So you add it quickly. So Blackjack and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C11\">it\u2019s probably based on probability as well. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">But I like that. I like the idea that I can go like, \u201cScott, there\u2019s a suspicion that your dice are incorrectly weighted,\u201d and be like, \u201cWell, we can put this rumor to rest immediately. It\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re going to take two samples of 30 rolls each. We\u2019re going to assess their means. We\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C31\">to see what they look like. And if they\u2019re even slightly suspicious we\u2019re going to pull some further tests and see what else we find.\u201d But if they\u2019re not, if they\u2019re clearly come back that they\u2019re fine, then hey, you just become a better player if you do.

Something would take <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201CD1\">over and it\u2019s just a voice of like, \u201cThe cops are coming to this party.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D1\">CLIENT: And was that psychic?

I\u2019m gone.\u201d And the people eventual realized when Fred leaves a party, go.

[0:44:05] You don\u2019t let them leave the room still believing the crazy thing you made up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2021B\">THERAPIST: That it\u2019s just play. It\u2019s a game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2021D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, by the way. No, that wasn\u2019t real.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2021F\">THERAPIST: The game is over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20221\">CLIENT: That wasn\u2019t real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20223\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:44:16).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20225\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t go somewhere thinking that was real and then tell that to somebody else. That\u2019s\u2026 I just\u2026 I was just playing around. I was playing. And that has happened today. I can\u2019t remember what it was. I just made up something. Yea, blah, blah, blah, blah. And among my friends, I was making it up. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202251\">I\u2019m like\u2026 and Leif is like, \u201cOh wow. That was real interesting.\u201d I stopped and I put my hand on his leg. I was like, \u201cWell Leif, you do know I was making that up. I can\u2019t let you leave the room, Leif, believing that\u2019s true.\u201d We\u2019re all laughing because I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And just to be clear, not <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202252\">true. Not true at all.\u201d (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20227\">Although I know it sounded real when I said it. I was thinking about it the other day. Oh, there\u2019s this game I used to like to play in college. And I think about it. I\u2019m like there was a game I liked to play. More like that was a game I played. I played Reality. [0:45:05] Not everyone else played Reality. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202271\">Every now and then we\u2019d play Reality with other actors. You play reality with Steve and Steve can play Reality better than anybody. Steve was the teacher, the acting instructor. He played Reality scary well. He\u2019s the only person I would play Reality with and bow out. I\u2019d be like, \u201cYou win. You win Reality,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202272\">because whatever it was, whatever you believed, he would believe something that made sense and believe just as sincerely (inaudible at 0:45:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20226-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20226-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563457\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20229\">THERAPIST: He was your match.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2022B\">CLIENT: Oh, he was\u2026 yea, a match made. He could believe more deeply and sincerely and react incredibly well to whatever was happening. Like complete emotional honesty. His ego was fluid and also it was a drama department. So there was drama because everyone is shaping and (inaudible at 0:46:06) every <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2022B1\">day. Everyone was learning like (inaudible at 0:46:09) or anything they could be and like everything is fluid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2022D\">And especially if you\u2019re bipolar, shit is just fucking insane. You\u2019re becoming people. You\u2019re riding off this high of people. Well, you have crowds. So different from now today. When I had crowds then, I would pull the crowds together. I\u2019d be a focal point of crowds and people would just watch. I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2022D1\">become a one man show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2022F\">And wherever I was, at parties people were just like\u2026 people would circle around and like watch and listen to me talk and just tell stories. And I was like, \u201cThis is a story of love, sex and violence in the second grade.\u201d People would be like listen. I\u2019d tell the story of Monica and how she told me <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2022F1\">I\u2019d never love her again. I was like, \u201cThis is a story of love, sex and violence in the third grade.\u201d And I told the story of Sarah, my girlfriend at the time and how I dumped her. And how her friends then chased me around and thought I could keep her for a while. [0:47:02] Anyway but I told these stories <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2022F2\">and be these people. But we didn\u2019t trust Steve because Steve played with Reality except he wouldn\u2019t tell you when you left the room that it wasn\u2019t real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20231\">THERAPIST: Oh, yea. He wouldn\u2019t stop playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20233\">CLIENT: Yea. Well, he would tell people\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20235\">THERAPIST: That it was a game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20237\">CLIENT: \u2026what made sense at the time for them to hear so they would let him be. So he would tell people, \u201cOh yea, you\u2019re going to be part of this show in this way.\u201d And then he would not do that. And so people (inaudible at 0:47:34) Steve lies. And I came to him one day and I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is what is <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202371\">happening. We don\u2019t trust you. Here\u2019s why we don\u2019t trust you blah, blah, blah, blah, this whole sort of thing. And I just need to get this done. You need to get this done. It\u2019s like we don\u2019t have time for any of this bullshit.\u201d And he starts\u2026 he\u2019s talking. He\u2019s crying. He\u2019s like, \u201cBecause this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202372\">like I can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m really upset that I\u2019ve affected people this way.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cSteve, we both know you can turn that on and off.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20239\">THERAPIST: Oh, the crying? [0:48:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2023B\">CLIENT: He stops. He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2023D\">THERAPIST: How about that? Still playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2023F\">CLIENT: And he immediately stops crying. And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOK. So we understand what\u2019s going on here.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYea.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20241\">THERAPIST: Still playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20243\">CLIENT: And so we just\u2026 from that point on, it was fine. It was like, \u201cSteve, you\u2019re playing. I\u2019m playing. We\u2019re playing two different games.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20245\">THERAPIST: But he\u2019s always playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20247\">CLIENT: And so I was always playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20249\">THERAPIST: Or maybe (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2024B\">CLIENT: And so I started fighting.

I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t want you here.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I have to watch you do it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t want you here. I\u2019m doing my\u2026 this is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2024B1\">He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to grade you.\u201d Like, \u201cWatch the show.

You can pretend to care about me. You can pretend to care about me. And so why should I believe anything you had to say?\u201d [0:49:05] And people, they fall apart. They fall apart. Yea, playing <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2024F1\">a game called Reality. And yea, I was very different. I used to drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20251\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20253\">CLIENT: Yea. I\u2019m an excellent driver.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20255\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t notice that. Is it the\u2026 you think it was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20257\">CLIENT: Part of it is the city. Part of it was just the\u2026 like there\u2019s too much going on all of sudden. But I would drive from Melody down to Penelope\u2019s place like twice a week for my sessions with her. And I\u2019d be driving out of there during rush hour. Driving out of Providence in rush hour is ridiculous. <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202571\">There\u2019s this sort of like, OK. We know there aren\u2019t enough lanes and we know they don\u2019t make sense. Some of us know this ahead of time. You\u2019re learning quickly. Which lane are you going to get into? How are you going to tell me you\u2019re going to get into my lane? [0:50:05] How do I make sure I don\u2019t kill <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202572\">you and not be killed by you? Like this is all moving very quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20259\">THERAPIST: Yea, she was over on, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2025B\">CLIENT: Yea, way out that way. And once you cross the bridge into Georgetown, it\u2019s just easy sailing. It\u2019s like we\u2019re on like whatever. But once you\u2019re in Providence it\u2019s kill or be killed. When I realized that, that\u2019s when I was like, OK, now go drive like a Providence driver which is aggressively, <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2025B1\">right, and with consistence. And that\u2019s what the other drivers on the road want to know is that you\u2019re serious. It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m taking this lane right now. It\u2019s happening. So don\u2019t speed up. Don\u2019t slow down. I\u2019m getting into this space. You left a space and now it\u2019s mine.\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Well, I know we got to stop in a sec but what did you start to notice? There was more\u2026 how did you put it there? That you used to\u2026 driving was different then because there was there was less going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2025F\">CLIENT: I guess. [0:51:06] I drove on the back roads or on the highways. I drive mostly on back streets when I drive but I drive very well. My reaction time is amazing. My reflexes have saved me from multiple car accidents. It\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20261\">THERAPIST: Are you saying, though, that now it\u2019s too much? It\u2019s just like too much stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20263\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20265\">THERAPIST: Too much anxiety about or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20267\">CLIENT: Yea, I can\u2019t even get in the car on that side. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t\u2026 even when I\u2019m like, yea, I could drive to the corner. It\u2019d take me only ten minutes. And then it was like I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ll walk 25 minutes today instead of taking 7 minutes to drive there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20269\">THERAPIST: And did anything happen or anything that kind of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2026B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I think when I started smoking weed a lot I was worried I\u2019d get pulled over at some point and be like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re smoking weed the past day or something. So now you\u2019re going to jail or something.\u201d And then weed has given me an excuse not to have to drive. It\u2019s like, oh, I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2026B1\">possibly drive too stoned. But then I was driving for a while when I was working at Melody. [0:52:00] But I had a very specific route it took from Melody to my house which was most back streets, avoiding most lights, avoiding most people. It took me 17 minutes of the day but like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N2026A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2026A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563457\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2026D\">THERAPIST: I see.
