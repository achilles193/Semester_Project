So far so good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: So I went in and I took the test. I got a 48. I did poorly. I did poorly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: On Monday this was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I studied the stuff. I tried to learn it, and I realize my strategy is flawed. My strategy of going in, do six hours of math, is fatally flawed because there is a muscle. I think I\u2019m working out too long. It\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m going to go to krav for four hours. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d No, don\u2019t go to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">krav for four hours, are you insane? It\u2019s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: [That\u2019s a good point.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I can krav very hard for two hours. I\u2019ll puke a couple of times in the middle of it, but I can krav very hard for two hours. I can math really well for three hours. The fourth hour I start to lose it. You know, moving into that fifth and sixth is just, forget it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the volume you would learn if you did an hour and a half for four days as opposed to six hours one day is exponentially higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. It\u2019s insane that I\u2019m not doing that. It\u2019s insane that I\u2019m not doing that. At the same time, so many progress simulators for me to avail myself of. It\u2019s funny. For so long, Elder Scrolls Online you know (inaudible at 00:01:37). You\u2019ve heard of these video games?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. Elder Scrolls Online is the MMO version extension of these games. It\u2019s been coming out for quite some time. I played in the (inaudible at 00:01:48). I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t really like this game, whatever.\u201d [My buddy Charles is like] \u201cIt\u2019s really good though once you get past the beginning.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">I\u2019m like \u201cWhatever, it\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s $80 and I don\u2019t want to pay $80. It\u2019s dumb and I hate it. I got a free version of this other game. I\u2019ll play with that instead.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Then I went to his house and watched him play it for like two hours. As soon as I asked him like \u201cOh wait, you can be a werewolf?\u201d I was hooked. I\u2019m like \u201cFuck it.\u201d So I went home and I downloaded it and now I started playing it. Like there we go, I can be a werewolf, so I better just get going. I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">be a vampire if I so chose, but I never liked the way vampires (inaudible at 00:02:27) so I should probably avoid that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: The werewolf though, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: The werewolf is good, the werewolf is good. The only problem with the werewolf is being unable to stop being a werewolf when you want to. You turn into a werewolf for like three minutes. You can feast on things you\u2019ve killed to increase that time though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Uh huh. So if you\u2019re [going through a place], you need to kill everything. [You\u2019re feeding everything]. So the problem with the werewolf, at least in the other games, is you can\u2019t open chests and other things that you often need to do to finish quests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">So you run through the entire place as a werewolf and be like well, now I have to wait for like six minutes to calm down before being a human again. (chuckles) So I have to loot all these corpses (laughter) I\u2019ve left behind. Checking their weightto-gold ratio. If it\u2019s not at least one in ten, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">done. I walk into town with pairs of hide boots and bracers and go to the store and I\u2019m \u201cHere, do you want ten hide bracers?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563437\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You get payment for those or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, it\u2019s all the stuff you bring to the towns and sell to various merchants who have limited amounts of gold. But anyway, Elder Scrolls Online, I\u2019m playing it and it\u2019s this whole thing. It\u2019s incredibly complex and I\u2019m like oh my God, I\u2019m seeing my progress so well. For the past two days, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">the plan was to get up, do yoga, look at some math, you know, and then go about my day. It\u2019s not what happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: You kind of what you were sort of deep in the focus of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I left math. I did six hours of math, feeling burned, totally dead. I texted my drug dealer and I\u2019m like \u201cYou around?\u201d And he\u2019s like \u201cNo, but my roommate is there. He\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll head over there.\u201d I head over and meet the new guy. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d And he\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">\u201cYeah, I got these two here.

The quality, you know. Well, maybe not even. I mean, these are guys with professional grow rooms in New Hampshire, or so I hear. High quality stuff. I smoke it and I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">fine, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, like, you know, people it\u2019s like this people are like \u201cHey, let\u2019s go smoke some weed.\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got some [].\u201d \u201cHoly shit, let\u2019s smoke []. Like wow, that\u2019s powerful weed. Like whoa, I\u2019m fucking wasted.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t get that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I used to when I was a kid, but I think a lot of it is through suggestion, you know. Me being with all those other kids who are like \u201cWhoa\u201d this and that, and I\u2019m like \u201cOh yeah, whoa.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a social element to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. And once you start smoking alone, you\u2019re like, oh, it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s not like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: What is it more like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: (pause) More grounded in some ways, you know. It\u2019s just like all these various things are happening, but they\u2019re not mystifying. I\u2019m not seeing things. I\u2019m not like experiencing things that, you know, are fantastical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well, was it also, you know, with some of the you almost said like \u201cRight when I get out of the test\u201d well, you didn\u2019t say right after you got out of the test. You said \u201cAfterwards, I want to get some.\u201d What were you feeling after the test?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I was feeling disappointed in myself because I\u2019ve gotten myself in this position, you know. I put myself I was like, listen, I can do this. I\u2019ll go ahead and I\u2019ll cram it and I\u2019ll be bam-bam-bam-bam-bam. And I couldn\u2019t cram it. It was beyond my capability, you know. And that\u2019s when I realized. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">I\u2019m like, okay, this method will not work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Right? Like I\u2019m going in today and I\u2019ve got 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and a test on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I got an extension for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: So my professor was like \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Good, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Earlier in the semester he was like \u201cThis, this and this.\u201d At this point he\u2019s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563437\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Good.

You\u2019re going to do poorly and then you\u2019re going to do better.\u201d And he\u2019s like \u201cOkay, your first test attempt is never your actual test.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Let me just say one thing.

It is really hard to expect, I don\u2019t care who you are, to expect yourself to do statistic stuff solo. If you were in a class, you\u2019d be fine because it would be making you go, and I know that you would be feeling like \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to class.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: \u201cI may not like it, but I\u2019m going to go.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so much harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. I am doing it pretty hard where -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re doing it a really hard way. You know, you\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s safe.

Whereas I also have (singing) \u201cI miscounted the menus.\u201d I miscounted something I missed in the syllabus. There\u2019s a project. The last few chapters so there\u2019s a cumulative exam, right. The final is chapters six through eight. It\u2019s not really cumulative. It\u2019s the final exam, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">six, seven and eight, which is the stuff I\u2019ve been struggling with right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">The good news, I have to go over a lot of this anyway.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, it\u2019s a strategy, you know. The final project is two questions. Well, not really. One is on chapter nine and one is on chapter ten. So you read the rest of eight, nine and ten and then there\u2019s a data set. Like here\u2019s a problem and the data and here\u2019s a problem and the data. It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">for this problem, here are like five questions, you know. Derive this information from this data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">And for this problem, derive this information from this data and display it in the following ways. And that\u2019s the final bit. It\u2019s a take-home test for which you are to receive no outside help. Whatever. Thanks, Eugene (ph). THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:10:14)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, whatever. No outside help. Are you kidding me? It\u2019s a take-home you gave it to me I\u2019m doing a fucking self-directed learning.

But it\u2019s the anti-seizure part of marijuana and they give it to these kids with really bad seizures like (inaudible at 00:12:15).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it cures them for days. They don\u2019t have they\u2019re comparing with some study. So kids that like have seizures every day and then they all of a sudden don\u2019t have them for a few days. It\u2019s a very low dosage of this stuff. It doesn\u2019t get you high, it\u2019s just this one aspect of the drug. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">And I\u2019m like well, most mood stabilizers are not well, not most, but a lot of them are anti-seizure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: And I think that it may have applications for bipolar as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

To have you say to him \u201cHey, look, the mood stabilizing effect is quite evident.\u201d I\u2019d have at least something on my side. [Every little book is like] \u201cYeah, we can\u2019t recommend this. [We think it\u2019s terrible].\u201d Well, nothing ever affects me the same way.

Now dealing with that experience. So what I\u2019ll often do in that period of time is walk somewhere. I like to wake up in the morning and smoke a joint and then walk down here. Supposedly spring is the best time to smoke <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201191\">weed. Spring is the best time to smoke weed.

Listen, if I take <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201671\">it today, it\u2019s just gonna, you know \u201cand he\u2019s like \u201cYeah, take it \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">THERAPIST: So you got half of it right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">THERAPIST: So what was the half you got right?

I can do it though. I was like okay, but I know the math for these, you know. I\u2019m thinking I know a lot of the underlying math. I\u2019m like okay, you want me to do stuff, always convert everything to a z-score and then look at these charts. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D71\">Do some addition, subtraction and boom, there you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">And there\u2019s that, but now there\u2019s other stuff which is like finding mu when sigma is unknown or finding sigma when mu is unknown.

Essentially the algebraic formula [is to discover these <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D91\">things].

There\u2019s a handwritten page in the back that he\u2019s written that\u2019s part of the test.

I\u2019m the only one \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2030F\">CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm. Yeah. \u201cBecause when you go to school, you have to be with these people because you\u2019re like these people.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20311\">THERAPIST: Yeah because you\u2019re (inaudible at 00:37:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20313\">CLIENT: Like with these mentally challenged, you know, retarded and violent kids. He\u2019s like \u201cI really hated school. I hated it.\u201d Yep, you made sure of that. You were very clear. He went to school his very first day of school, sent him to kindergarten. She wanted to give it a shot. He punched a kid <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203131\">right in the nose and bloodied him up. Because his entire life, as soon as he was able to move I even said to myself, she\u2019s never going to hit him.

I said to myself, she\u2019s never going to hit him. So as soon as he was a baby, as soon as he had excellent control over his own body, I would wrestle with him a little bit. I played with him like you\u2019d play with a puppy. \u201cOh, can you turn yourself over and do this little thing?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203171\">The more he was able to grow, I\u2019d be like \u201cHey, can you throw a punch?\u201d so he\u2019d throw a punch. \u201cIf someone tries to throw a punch at you, here\u2019s how you block it. And here\u2019s how you throw kicks.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20319\">And the older he got, you know, even when he was three years old, I\u2019m like \u201cOkay, I have a knife. What are you going to do? Okay, I\u2019ve got a baseball bat. What do you do?\u201d And I remember the time he got a baseball bat. I swing the wiffle bat at him, you know, he like grabs it and he comes in and he <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203191\">spins and gets it. He grabs it tight and spins around and whacks me in the back of the head with his wiffle bat. My world was \u201cwhoa\u201d for a minute. I was like he pulls back again and I pull back and stop and I catch him and I\u2019m like \u201cOkay, that was good. Like that was really good.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2031B\">THERAPIST: Were you preparing him for your mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2031D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2031F\">CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. I was like \u201cNo, no one is going to hit you.\u201d And his very first day, you know and I taught him, you know. I was like \u201cPeople don\u2019t get to hit you. You hit back. You always hit back and here\u2019s how.\u201d And I pushed him. I pushed him. He would get angry and angry. And he\u2019d attack <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2031F1\">me sometimes, he would be so angry. Like I always stopped him but I was like \u201cThis is good. You need to know this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20321\">I remember one day, he was on the piano bench. He was small and we were like kind of [I was antagonizing him] and he leapt back directly off the piano bench and fell straight down and slammed his nose on the edge of it and it starts to bleed. He looks down and he\u2019s like \u201cOh!\u201d and he\u2019s freaking out <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203211\">because he\u2019s never bled before. He\u2019s bleeding from his nose a lot. And I spoke to him and I\u2019m like \u201cTrust me. I can fix this.\u201d He immediately stops crying. I just took his head and pushed his upper lip like up into his nose. I saw this in The Karate Kid and it actually works and it stops the nosebleed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203212\">But that look in his eyes, that was the trust, like \u201cOkay.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20323\">So his very first day of school, this bigger kid like bullies him and pushes him.

I remember when he was three years old. It was the last time I was ever staying with my mom. It was the summer and I needed to stay there, and she put a mattress on the floor of the pantry. She\u2019s like \u201cThis is your room.\u201d There\u2019s no door, there\u2019s no privacy, there\u2019s nothing. But she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2034F1\">like \u201cThis is your room.\u201d I lived there for the summer [before I moved in with my uncle] (inaudible at 00:41:30).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20351\">THERAPIST: You just had to stay with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20353\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it was after she divorced James. And Kevin was three or so and he screams at her. He\u2019s like \u201cMommy, you\u2019re a bitch\u201d and he runs away. She went to go after him and I\u2019m like \u201cStop. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d So I follow him and I closed the door. I go to the room and he\u2019s on the top bunk and <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203531\">he\u2019s crying. I\u2019m like \u201cKevin, listen to me. You\u2019re right.

This is something that -\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20359\">THERAPIST: Yeah, if you do, you\u2019re really going to see something (inaudible at 00:42:21).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he doesn\u2019t remember any of this, you know. He doesn\u2019t remember anything.

This is the point in the day where I come down from the first I would normally be out smoking a joint about now, but I\u2019m going to math instead which is good. I\u2019m going to walk and that\u2019s going to metabolize some more. I\u2019m going to drink some coffee and sit down and <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2035F1\">do some math and take my first shot at this and do the best I can. Keep working, keep working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20361\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20363\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well that means then that if you do today and say whatever you get, then the second time you go in you\u2019ll have even more time to study before the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20365\">CLIENT: Yeah, and again, the cumulative and the project, that\u2019s what\u2019s giving me hope. That\u2019s just making me think I am going to learn statistics. By time I\u2019m done with this, I will know everything chapter six onward is the real course, if you ask me. Everything before that is just terms and like <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203651\">some basic tools, you know. Here\u2019s a variety of some different types of graphs you might use, you know.

It is. The thing is just getting up, every day it\u2019s like the goal is this, wake up and don\u2019t have that first joint.

I\u2019m like okay, these are things which are in the realm of possibility. I retake the first test. I can get eight more points on that <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203A11\">and get 100.

So I get 15 points instead of 10. You know, I\u2019ll retake this one and get 100 instead, and the final retake it and get 100. And the final project, get 100 because there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t get 100 on the final project. I\u2019m like \u201cEugene, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203A51\">check my math, please.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N203A9\">CLIENT: \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, tell me why, you know.\u201d (pause) Fix the problem. Yeah, so that\u2019s the goal, man, is like wake up and don\u2019t have that first joint. Have that afterwards. But again, the mood-stabilizing effect is evident, is it not?
