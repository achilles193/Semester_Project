I don\u2019t know if it was bad where you were, but like\u2026I don\u2019t know. I just have the worse car possible for the snow. Which I realize\u2026because like I drove to pick Keller up from school in their like super Outback and then I drove back home, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">and I was like, \u201cThis is an entirely different experience.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: But. Yeah. It took me like twice as long. That\u2019s okay. I got pretty good at driving in the snow. It\u2019s not bad. But yeah. [Pause] Yeah. And I think like Keller\u2019s school was delayed two hours and Kim doesn\u2019t need to go into work until like 11 or 12. And so I can sort of take my time in shoveling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">out and getting on my way. [Pause] I was really hoping they\u2019d close the state capitol though. (Laughs) But that is okay. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019ve done that like four or five times so far in this hour. Like express\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: You mean within the last five minutes? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Expressed sort of frustration about something and then you immediately followed that by saying it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Hmmm. [Pause] Hmmm. [Pause] So one of the things that James and I talked about with Dr. Jannis\u2026I sort of surprised it. Like how much it hit me or like\u2026yeah. How tough it was for me to talk about. I felt like we haven\u2019t really like gotten excited about the prospect of moving in our conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">Like we haven\u2019t really been treating the next step as like this could be a really fun adventure for us. And I think for me it\u2019s just like I don\u2019t feel like I have it in me to deal with major disappointment. So I\u2019m just sort of trying not to be hopeful about things. Ahmm. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Or just not actually protected me in the way that I always hoped that it would protect me, but that\u2019s how it goes. That\u2019s what I do. [Pause] Yeah. The idea of just saying that I was frustrated or disappointed in something and just leaving it at that seems sort of horrifying to me. Yeah. [Pause] I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I guess I have to feel like it seems fairly ridiculous to me to be disappointed that I have to go to work on a day that I would have had to go to work anyway, that like I work three days a week the same three days every week. I don\u2019t know. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: In a way, they\u2019re your like trying to stave off disappointment in yourself as well as somebody who only works three days a week, but doesn\u2019t even want to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I do feel like my job is considerably like more relaxed than it ever in the case for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: So yeah. And I also still like\u2026it\u2019s so\u2026it\u2019s really hard for me not to be in the academic world anymore. It\u2019s really hard and I\u2019m really disappointed with myself. The answers sort of like grieving that. like \u2026 [pause] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">And I feel like\u2026I feel like that comes out in like weird ways, in ways that I don\u2019t really\u2026that don\u2019t make me feel good about myself. Like\u2026it\u2019s like, we have like Bible study discussions at church and I just talk way too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">Like I just talk too much and I sort of like catch myself during, after and get really frustrated with myself. I can\u2019t stop or I don\u2019t\u2026yeah. I feel like I need to get a better handle on that and I\u2019m not. [Pause] Yeah. It\u2019s really [inaudible 0:09:40]. [Pause] Yeah. So that\u2019s what I was playing out in my work now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562080\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Also like I sort of figured out how to do my job and so now I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. Time for the next thing.\u201d (Laughs) Ahmm, which is also something that makes me frustrated with myself. You know, it\u2019s like I\u2019ll be both very focused on the problem at hand and like very focused on the kids and where they are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">and what we\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">And then at the same time, just like really bored. (Laughs). Ahmm, and like I guess that\u2019s not surprising, but it\u2019s\u2026I don\u2019t really have like a fixed word. [Pause] And I know that like theoretically going back on this scholarship, is always a possibility, but like I think about it and all I can really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">see is like how bad it would be for me. Like how sort of toxic it gets and ahmm\u2026yeah. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">But I don\u2019t know what I want to do. Yeah. [inaudible 0:13:14] doing what I can do right now. It\u2019s just like think about it and explore different career options and wait until we know where we\u2019re going to be. Ahmm. [Pause] And this is frustrating to realize that this thing that was enough for me for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">a while, isn\u2019t working out for me anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Are you referring to working with the kids?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause] [inaudible 0:15:34] like\u2026so really, really enjoying what you\u2019re doing, until you figure out how to do it well and then getting bored with it. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s very much how my mom operates and so that\u2019s also like\u2026I don\u2019t know. Makes me anxious. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I was thinking I can\u2019t yet tell if, you know, that you like the kids, I imagine, so close to them in some ways. And I think you\u2019re good about what you\u2019re doing with them, but as a kind of intellectual stimulation or interest in learning new things that just isn\u2019t there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And that\u2019s a lot of it or whether it\u2019s something more I think like what you\u2019re sort of pointing toward about your mom, where once you\u2019re kind of settled into something and in a kind of stable situation with it, and maybe with people in it, something happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it\u2019s probably some of both. Yeah. I mean I do really find myself like starving for an intellectual problem. But I also think that it\u2019s almost just like thriving on chaos. (Laughs) And that scares me and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I mentioned that\u2019s the scary part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I feel, you know, pretty ashamed of that. Yeah. Not like it just gets so destructive. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It also reminds me of\u2026because what I remember about how you were with academic work, where you would kind of wait till the end of the semester and do a lot of it, and then, you know, work incredibly hard, stay up and do whatever else just to kind of crunch and get everything done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Um hum. Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s that sort of built-in cycle [inaudible 0:19:31] I really like in some ways. And it\u2019s also really bad for me. [Pause] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I wonder if some of it is about again trying to [inaudible 0:21:37] or avoid if a pretty intense degree of disappointment, I think most immediately in yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Like with the kids that if you\u2019re settled into it and you can do it and it\u2019s going well or smoothly, I know that you start to feel maybe disappointed in yourself with this is what you\u2019re doing or\u2026I\u2019m not sure. I mean like the fact that you could do it. Means you can\u2019t be all that great to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">begin with. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562080\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t tell how much of, like to what extent I really need to be solving problems and to what extent I really need to think of myself as somebody who solves problems,, I think. I don\u2019t know. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, there must be plenty of problems though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean there are and that\u2019s interesting. (Laughs) But like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I get there not novel at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. [Pause] Yeah. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s more like it reassures you and keeps you focused on something else other than how bad you\u2019re feeling about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: [inaudible 0:25:41]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Like solving problems. Doing novel things. I don\u2019t mean that\u2019s all the things for you obviously, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: No, but it definitely like both distracts me from me feeling badly about myself and helps me feel a little better about myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I was just really good at it. I keep thinking that like I will miss it less and I just don\u2019t\u2026yeah. Sometimes I feel like I miss it more because I\u2019m not confronted with how horrible it was. (Laughs) [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What was it that was so horrible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Just like\u2026I was just so anxious about being good enough and it felt like the environment I was in was designed to make me more anxious about being good enough. And none of the expectations were clear and there weren\u2019t any tools for doing what was actually expected or for finding out what was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">expected from me or doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">But the consequences of not doing it were very high and it did sort of like feed into the sort of like feast and famine and pattern of like working very, very hard and then not working at all, and not feeling good about myself either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">You know, and like at the end of the day, I was working really, really hard and not really getting paid very much for it. And the expectation is that I would continue to work very hard and maybe stop being able to get paid at all for it. And yeah. [Pause] It was just really exciting. [Pause] I felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">like I\u2026I felt like the things that I\u2019m good at and that I looked good at were being used.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">Yeah. Some of the things that I was good at were not being used, but like, you know, it probably seems like a problem that I think of it as this very sad thing that my skill for learning languages and putting together an argument and writing things, is not being used. And I didn\u2019t think that it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">a terrible thing that like my skills for like empathizing and being with people and helping people solve problems and being around small children or children in general were not being used. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: It seems a little crazy to that I value one more than the other, but like I do sort of think that one thing counts and the other doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t want\u2026I don\u2019t want that to rule my decisions either because I think that\u2019s crazy. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There\u2019s something about being talented and being or maybe even knowing valuable or valued like for things that are\u2026really that are pretty specific to you. I mean, nobody else has them, that you do and a lot of people don\u2019t. And that\u2019s having something to do with what\u2019s also good about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562080\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.

[Pause] At one point when I was talking with my dad about like thinking about becoming a priest. And I don\u2019t remember exactly what he said, but he made it pretty clear that like being smart and being good at writing was not really what he valued in me and was not what\u2026basically is like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">\u201cWell if you\u2019re a good priest, that\u2019s not what will make you a good priest.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:34:18]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: That it\u2019s not like for him it\u2019s about like being able to be with people and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

But I wasn\u2019t clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Which I think he was sort of meaning to say something nice, but it really didn\u2019t feel good. (Laughs) [Pause] I mean that\u2019s one of the\u2026that\u2019s sort of the draw of it for me it\u2019s that like, you know, I think that like religious leadership that can think is really important. (Laughs) And maybe a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">little bit lacking much of the time. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">Like the church had like something like basically a campaign slogan that I think is actually pretty horrible, but the thought was good. Which was like, \u201cA church where you don\u2019t have to check your mind at the door.\u201d Which is both like yes, that expresses one of the things that many people find, including <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">myself, find really valuable in the church, but it\u2019s also like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:36:22].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Fucking elitist, I think. (Laughs) Really? Like is that actually what we want to\u2026like is that what we want at the front, like at the entrance of churches when people are coming in, like to try to draw them in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Right. If there were some way to say that like positively about the Episcopal church without implicitly like dissing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Everyone else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: \u2026just about everyone else. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: I think most churches deserve it. Sorry. (Laughs). No I don\u2019t know [inaudible 0:36:56] think that. I certainly hear from a lot of people who left the church because they felt like they weren\u2019t allowed to be thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Ahmm, but like\u2026so like I think I do think that\u2019s important in church leadership. But like\u2026and I also think that being able to be with people is crucially important and I think I can do both of those things and that\u2019s exciting for me. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I also think\u2026wondering or thinking about how it is they play here for you and my sense is that like sometimes it\u2019s sort of nice and reassuring both for yourself and in terms of how it sort of comes across to me to be able to like think carefully, analytically.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562080\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">And well everything you\u2019re talking about, and other times incredibly frustrating both in terms of what you feel like you can\u2019t do and also I think imagining that it looks bad to me when\u2026because of anxiety or whatever else, you can\u2019t think clearly or feel like you\u2019re thinking while here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I think both for sort of feeling effective and probably you want to be able to do that. And I think you also, maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I think you also want to look good to me that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I think sometimes you feel like you do other times, because of the nature of the things that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s hard to do that and that gets upsetting and frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like it\u2019s getting easier for me to sort of accept that I\u2019m not going to be able to think clearly about everything all the time. (Laughs) You know, a little bit easier at least. (Laughs) Maybe not easy. (Laughs) What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I had the feeling you thought I was smiling as you were saying that because I was like sort of disagreeing or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yes. That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Or qualifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Which is not at all what I was thinking or smiling about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: More that\u2026yeah. Like it just sort of sounds like you too want to be able to be more flexible about that and\u2026I guess my point is I wasn\u2019t disagreeing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s also like\u2026it\u2019s sort of weird for me. Like it\u2019s weird for me to talk to you about what I\u2019m good at because like you really don\u2019t have anything else other than my word for that. And like my word and then what you see of me in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">And so like I can sort of say I\u2019m very good with people or I can\u2026I\u2019m very good at like being with people in hard times and teaching and things I can say, but like I\u2019m very good at writing and all of that. But like I don\u2019t have any idea like how\u2026to what extent you believe me or like what that sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">like to you. And so I think sometimes like I become more anxious. Like it becomes more important for me to be able to think clearly in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Because I feel like that is what you hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:41:39] and not just telling me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It seems like that\u2026since that I question or I don\u2019t really believe you, it\u2019s important that I\u2019m not at the moment [inaudible 0:43:19].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Or that like you could only believe me if you never saw any evidence to the contrary. Like\u2026yeah.
