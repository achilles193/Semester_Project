It was just kind of a... (PAUSE) It was just kind of a pain not having, just not having like any wiggle room in my schedule to like just kind of slow down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Not like I\u2019m able to miss any more classes. I missed a few classes and (inaudible at 00:00:45) a small number of classes and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Then you run the risk of like having to retake a course and stuff. I just wish so bad to be able to just like put the brakes on everything and have a vacation for a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you didn\u2019t take... Did you take time off when you had your Spring Break?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Umm... (PAUSE) I mean, I was studying the whole time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: So, I mean, in a sense I did. But I didn\u2019t really stop doing anything. I just used that as time to kind of catch up with stuff. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just looking at my schedule... It\u2019s like I get right out of school and I\u2019m going into my internship and it\u2019s just... It\u2019s just going to be kind of fast paced for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: You mean like an internship this summer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Didn\u2019t I tell you about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. I got an internship with... I got actually like the ideal internship, what I\u2019m interested in doing which is public defense. I got an internship at the Bellevue Public Defense Office (ph) which is basically the SEC (ph) office in Bellevue for public counsel basically. [02:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">SEC being the agency that does all the hiring and the staffing for kind of public appointed counsel for indigent clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: They... Before the group SEC was kind of created in collaboration with the state, they had these kind of like independent offices that would sprout up and would try to give free counsel to indigent clients before the state started doing it really. So this place that I\u2019m going to be at now is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">one of those places called Bellevue Defenders. And there\u2019s a lot of different organizations that did that kind of before the state kind of took on those roles. Like a really famous one was the Inner Harbor Defenders in Baltimore and stuff. So this office kind of kept that name as it got kind of assumed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200412\">under that umbrella. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: But it\u2019ll be in Bellvue so there\u2019s a lot of indigent kind of clients there. There\u2019s a lot of crime obviously so there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in those courts. And I\u2019ll be doing it with the group of officers who are primarily in the superior court as opposed to the district court. So higher <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">and greater (ph) fences... Everyone gets arraigned in the district court which is like, for example, where my dad works, you know, kind of more... I think it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Lower stakes crimes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s definitely lower stakes crimes. There\u2019s some cut off. I mean, obviously all capital offenses or whatever are in the superior court. But I think it\u2019s... I should know this. It\u2019s either any offense that carries the possibility of over two years in prison, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563443\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: You get arraigned in the district court and if you get charged or indicted with either or with any offense that is over that threshold, you move to the superior court. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: My dad mostly deals with, you know, like petty thefts and larcenies and DUIs and stuff like that. But a lot of the more serious stuff will move up to the superior court. So those will be the things that I\u2019ll be kind of working with day in and day out. So it\u2019ll be a real education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s sentence... Not felony grade or something like that as much? Or maybe there is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: No. There will be felonies and misdemeanors in the district court. So that\u2019s not necessarily the cutoff. To the extent that felonies tend to carry more serious penalties... I mean, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s misdemeanors carry punishment over that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Two years... Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure actually. A lot of the stuff you learn in school are kind of these general principles that kind of expand over like the course of all the states and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: One of the interesting things is you have like... I have like very little practical knowledge of how this stuff applies to Connecticut specifically which is like one of the weird things about legal education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what... I guess that\u2019s... Is that the idea of the test, studying for the test?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. The test is... There\u2019s like a multi-state element to it and then there\u2019s like a Connecticut element to it where you need to know the things specific to the state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: So a lot of the studying for the test will be learning those specifics more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: But it\u2019ll be nice to see how... It\u2019ll be good to get in there and get to know the people in that office only just for the practical experience of it. But it\u2019ll also just be really good because these will be the people that I\u2019m eventually applying for a job with at some point. I mean, working <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">at the Bellevue office would be, you know, an ideal place for a job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Oh. Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: I want to work in a SEC office and it would be great to do it in a place like Bellevue or something. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Oh cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: And I really got it just through kind of connections that I have with people. Ike (ph) put my in touch with someone...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: ...that he knew and I kind of knew tangentially and he just put me in touch with someone else and I sent this guy an e-mail. And I didn\u2019t hear back from him for like a month. Then he finally got in touch with me just for like a couple casual conversations online. I think just based on me being <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">referred to him by someone that he kind of knew really well. He took me on as an intern. Whereas otherwise it would have been like (LAUGHTER) a really arduous... Like that was kind of like a back door behind a much more kind of formalized application process that I just didn\u2019t even engage with at all. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200792\">So I was really, really, really fortunate in that sense. And it worked out really, really, really well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Oh great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really happy about that. And I may even be able to get the school to pay me a stipend for doing it because it\u2019s an unpaid internship. So that would be really good. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563443\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s really nothing else more that I would have wanted to do. Those are kind of competitive positions I think. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Oh good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: But... Yeah. It\u2019s just... I would just like a month off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re going to go straight from school into that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I might have like a week off maybe. Yeah. (PAUSE) But a lot of it\u2019s probably going to be taken up with just like a lot of prep work for going into it, learning a lot of the court rules and stuff for... Most of the stuff I\u2019ll be doing there is like writing (inaudible at 00:07:55) and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Oh okay. But you get to know the players and the system and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: I get to move from like reading about the stuff in textbooks to seeing how the stuff actually plays out which I\u2019m sure is going to be very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. And it... Is it kind of like full time? Do you do it full time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: This will be full time (inaudible at 00:08:15) for forty hours week. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: It\u2019ll actually be something to think about with, in terms of scheduling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. Okay. When do you start, by the way? Or when is it roughly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: I definitely have at least the full month of June and the full month of July. It may kind of creep into the last week of May and it may creep into August. But... (PAUSE) At a minimum, it\u2019ll be the start of June.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: And it\u2019ll probably be like a nine to five thing. So we\u2019ll... Yeah. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see how that plays out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: But yeah.

What do you think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Just earlier this week I was just getting really agitated. You know, I just wanted to just... I just needed to sleep for a couple of days and even like... Just at home, I just didn\u2019t want to do any cleaning or anything and I could tell it was getting kind of aggravating for Laney (ph), I think. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD1\">I just felt like I just couldn\u2019t like, just like do something for myself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: ...for one day without having all these other things start to like, you know, poke their head in.

Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201091\">for example, I had this class and we had this whole accomplice liability for criminal law. And I hadn\u2019t looked at anything for the class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">But in my dreams, for the whole morning, I was teaching myself this like made up material about what accomplice liability was. I mean, I hadn\u2019t even looked at it. I didn\u2019t even know what it meant. I was just making this stuff up. And then I\u2019d wake up and I\u2019d just be like... I\u2019d almost be like confused <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B1\">as if that was actually based in fact or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2010A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563443\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Huh.

You mean like trying to sleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was trying to get some sleep. Like that was the whole trade off. Maybe I won\u2019t be so prepared for class but that means I can get like a good night\u2019s sleep. (LAUGHTER) And then my whole night was just me waking up, being like, \u201cAm I in class? Am I reading right now or something?\u201d I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201131\">know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: Just really just kind of restless kind of sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: And then it just made me feel even more crappy the next day because I felt like I was even more tired than I was before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

I guess that\u2019s, that you wanted some break or rest from it and almost like your mind wouldn\u2019t let yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: I felt like I was less able to just get a good night\u2019s sleep even with, even by just trying to just devote all my time just to that.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. And I was just... I was just feeling overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Well, I think maybe there\u2019s something there about that in some ways there\u2019s kind of a nagging feeling about, nagging feeling of something that\u2019s left unattended if you\u2019re trying to get a good night\u2019s sleep. (LAUGHTER) You know? Like we talked about... Like how can you get a good night\u2019s sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D1\">when you\u2019re worrying about something. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re sort of saying it\u2019s hard to just do that. It\u2019s hard to kind of (PAUSE) like... It\u2019s hard to feel like, \u201cOh yeah. I can have a break from this and it be something restorative.\u201d There\u2019s something that you feel. \u201cBut what am I leaving left undone?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I end up just feeling a little more anxious about everything and just... (PAUSE) Yeah. I guess it\u2019s just frustrating to not feel like I can like just remove myself. Because that\u2019s kind of like the ultimately frustrating thing about it is afterwards I just feel like that\u2019s not even an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And at the same time, I was just thinking about it as maybe it\u2019s your attempt to try. You know, as opposed to just keep on working and working. And, you know, in some way, it seems to me last week we were getting into this a little bit about, yeah... I seem to have a lot (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201311\">at 00:17:49). And taking some sort of other approach that feels little less anxiety ridden because it feels like something\u2019s left undone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">And it seems like this week you\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, I want to try and rest,\u201d some attempt to try and have that. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I just could see the kind of meter of... (PAUSE) Yeah. You know like when you see those things on commercials talking about like the national debt like rapidly increasing and all that stuff? It\u2019s like all that, you know, all that happens when I try to just do a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201351\">something like that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: ...and I feel like I need to...

Weighing all the pros and cons, it just would be better like if I can just let myself maybe try and feel better. But like all like... I just can\u2019t sleep. All I can hear is like those things clicking, like the debt increasing and increasing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D1\">You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">Yeah. It just got me really frustrated. I felt like... I felt like even Laney and I kind of like got a little frustrated with ourselves one night, you know, just because I wasn\u2019t... You know, I think I just kind of left the house a mess because I just wanted to go to sleep. I just felt like I should be able to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: You should be able to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: I just want to go to sleep.

(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. And feeling when you do that, boy, yeah, the numbers on the deck... (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I just felt really guilty. I felt really bad about myself. I didn\u2019t feel very... (PAUSE) It\u2019s kind of a shameful or whatever, I guess. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Can you tell me a bit about that? What about the... What...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: Like I wanted this week to be living like alone in a house where I can just be there by myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: And like I didn\u2019t want to be living with Laney. You know what I mean? I wanted to like be home alone. You know? Like I wanted to not be... (PAUSE) Yeah. I didn\u2019t want to be, you know, in a shared space with anybody. I wanted to be by myself.

I feel like, \u201cYou guys knew about this or whatever?\u201d You know what I mean? And know they\u2019re just calling me into action just to be excited or something. I don\u2019t know. It just seems (inaudible at 00:24:31).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: It just made it seem like less kind of (PAUSE) substantive or something. You know? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No. I was thinking to you, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhy am I...\u201d As you say, this felt very artificial because why didn\u2019t anybody say anything from the beginning. You\u2019re supposed to all the sudden act excited but it\u2019s just kind of this strange thing about not being told about it at all or... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: It just made it seem even more just like orchestrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No. Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: Like... (PAUSE) It just seems like maximize the fact that you\u2019re not actually excited about this. But, you know, you need to do these things to seem excited about it. You know, it just seemed even more trivial. I don\u2019t know. I just felt like... (PAUSE) I just felt like kind of crumbling under <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B1\">the weight of all this stuff this week. You know what I mean? I\u2019m just really frustrated with how it\u2019s making me feel. That\u2019s what I felt really frustrated about. The fact that like I couldn\u2019t just feel good like with myself about making those decisions because even when I tried to I couldn\u2019t even sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">You know what I mean?

One thing to, you know, like decide not to do that stuff and then get like chewed up by my teachers or yelled at by my parents or something. But if I can just genuinely relax with it and just not really care. You know what I mean? But it seemed like I couldn\u2019t even get myself to not care <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201951\">about it for like one night. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t even have the ability to like make that choice myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: You know?

You know what just, what comes to mind, and I\u2019ve got to say it might be the first time I\u2019ve ever thought about this in reference to you, it just strikes me as significant is like I\u2019ve been thinking in somewhere, at least in my mind, was implied a sort of, \u201cHey wait. I need to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F1\">care of myself.\u201d And kind of a more function of... Like some sort of thing that came to mind was, you know, a guy that\u2019s sick that\u2019s needing tending to. And, you know, one thing that\u2019s kind of been conspicuously absent in things as far back as, you know, probably even earlier but at least to the divorce <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F2\">is this kind of, this kind of absence of you getting a certain kind of attention, a certain kind of, not just asking how you\u2019re doing but something about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2019E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563443\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">I was thinking, \u201cGosh you had a long week.\u201d I had the...

But I was thinking what\u2019s kind of implied in that is when one goes to bed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A11\">and is feeling sick, somebody else picks up the load. Somebody else kind of tends to things and you feel kind of taken care of. It\u2019s what kind of... What I\u2019m getting at maybe is it\u2019s very interesting how absent those kind of ideas are for you it seems to me. I mean, at least what we talked about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">CLIENT: Well, yeah.

You know? Like even if it means the tension with Laney or with my parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C31\">or something.

I could remember really well when I woke up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">I had this like book that I\u2019d actually be completely certain that I wasn\u2019t playing around with... I hadn\u2019t looked at the material. But I had like made stuff up in this really like intricate network of rules that I was like trying to learn in bed to like justify sleeping in longer.

This was the same week, I think probably like the same night that I had the other dream. I don\u2019t know.

What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">THERAPIST: That dream coming up in light, in the context of these feelings of your mom asking you to contact your cousin and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">CLIENT: Yeah.

His mom just died.\u201d You know what I mean? Like people <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202931\">like looking at me like that and really being like, \u201cWow. Geoffrey must be going...
