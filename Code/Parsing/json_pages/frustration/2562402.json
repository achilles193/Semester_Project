So unfortunately, I have continued doing pretty crazed since last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Why? Talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like it\u2019s a family joke that I always forget birthdays, because I always forget birthdays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: And the only person I can remember is my brother, and I don\u2019t know why, like it\u2019s 4\/14, so that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. But I forgot this year, and when I remembered, or like had missed it, I just started sobbing, and I was lying in bed, and I was like, \u201cOh, his birthday.\u201d And that\u2019s not, it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">really how I react to a lot of things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">But it was so especially like my parents and my brother, like they always, they\u2019ll be like, \u201cYou got the right week.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d And, but I just like, it was weird because I just started sobbing and I didn\u2019t really, I wasn\u2019t thinking that my brother would be mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I just was crying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Did you feel like you were losing it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, I felt really overwhelmed and just like everything\u2019s happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">So and then I had like a, definitely wrote the worst paper that I have ever written for (inaudible at ), which was weird, also. Like I was looking for a (inaudible at ) research, which isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve done a lot, like Morgan, but so there was that. And when I finished the paper, what I was thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">is like I don\u2019t think I can make it to December, like working at my job until then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And the thing I thought of doing, and I would, that feeling to, two thoughts on this is thinking like three months of short-term disability through work which would be, that\u2019s 100% pay, so there\u2019s that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">And I wouldn\u2019t be at work. I guess I feel like so just like overwhelmed and just like not able to keep it together. I feel like being at work is making that so much harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: But I also feel kind of weird about it. I mentioned to you I was talking to my brother the other night. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: And asked him if he had ever taken a planned leave, and he said no, because what he did was end up in the hospital and then you know, called from there and work it out after he was already a patient. He had suggested, like why don\u2019t you quit your job and live off savings, which I don\u2019t have, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">so no, I can\u2019t, unfortunately. But yeah, like it\u2019s, the way I feel about is it like that (inaudible at ), if someone else is talking to me. I would be like, \u201cYou should definitely take that leave, go for it.\u201d But I feel uncomfortable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">Like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: My sense of you is that you feel guilty and like you should soldier through it, and like it\u2019s probably not as bad as you think or are making it out to be, something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Pretty much, along with I really don\u2019t feel like my parents want this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I worry that Ashby\u2019s going to be crazy, like resentful. And the other thing, I had thought about this kind of vaguely like January, but then I was thinking if I take this chunk of time off and I\u2019m just like home, like that will make me feel really crazy, like being home and not doing anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">it being winter, et cetera, et cetera. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562402\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">But now I\u2019m just like, but I don\u2019t think I can, I don\u2019t feel like I can get crazier being at home, and also I could leave my own apartment, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve just been thinking about it the last couple days, and if, even though I feel very like uncomfortable, it also kind of feels like that would be a relief to not have to be at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Especially since it\u2019s coming around performance review season, and I just can\u2019t imagine that happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Just mainly think of it of, when you went on leave a couple of times, once before your surgery and once after?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: No, once was for like, it started before my surgery, but included surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: And then once a year later to kind of deal with\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: For pain problem. But so what, you were having surgery, yeah. I know, this is obviously a different thing, sort of cause, but I think I was remembering your other leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, after it happened, like after I, you know, did the paperwork, it was a huge relief. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">And I think, I think it will be. Like I mean, the other thing I\u2019ve been thinking about is just like the idea of like burnout, like emotional burnout, being burned out from work. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought more about in terms of like doing political activism or like helping run conventions and other <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">things where sometimes it\u2019s just like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m too exhausted, I have to stop.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Like I guess I\u2019ve always, well I\u2019ve often tried, thought of my job as just being like this is the place I go, you know, five days a week, and you know, it\u2019s not, I mean depending, like I always get emotionally invested, but I try to think my job would be this thing I do during the week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">And not something that I\u2019m like thinking about all the time, or am concerned about, whatever. But I guess since I\u2019m thinking of employeeship as, I\u2019ve invested time and money in employeeship being a career, there\u2019s been a lot more emotional stuff, and I also feel like some of the things that happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">with the office transition and (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">It gets hard because all the things that are frustrating, but I think one of the biggest things is that I feel this sort of social contract with whatever you have at work was working, and there\u2019s not, well it\u2019s hard, because I don\u2019t really trust anything that anyone says mostly, but I feel like effort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">to repair that hasn\u2019t really happened, which it\u2019s also unclear to me if that\u2019s even something like a concern. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">A priority, or like even a thought, like I guess at a management level, is this something you\u2019ve thought of trying to work on? And I don\u2019t really think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I guess I find myself like going back and thinking broadly here, not like, things have been getting worse over the last three years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: And how you\u2019ve been feeling. I mean, you\u2019ve been feeling more anxious, and more down, and more incapacitated by it, and then in the last few months especially, like weepier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: And I don\u2019t know the reason for any of that, which is bothering me. I mean\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: And I know things at work are really bad, and that you are quite burned out from the way things are bad. They\u2019ve been bad for a long time, including at some other points, quite bad. I mean, there\u2019s all the stuff with Will [], there\u2019s all the stuff from the beginning of the transition and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">the uncertainty about whether you, or anybody else was going to have a job, and what it was going to look like. And lots of other things. You know, there\u2019s a sort of, in the last six months or so, I think I\u2019ve got the timing right, there are like maybe four or five months with changes in the medication, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B2\">which, you know, have some effect, although you changed back to pretty much what you\u2019d been on. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562402\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I mean, the reason why I made the medication change, or asked for it, is I was feeling really\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: My sense, although I don\u2019t know, is that you\u2019re sort of doing less social stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Oh, yes. So it was for my mentors, I was like, so I decided to take Xerox, like (inaudible at ) had published, and that I\u2019d scan into pdfs, and just be like, \u201cHey, here you go.\u201d Because I also decided to just break up with the mentorship basically, because it\u2019s not going, it\u2019s done nothing for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not really sure. Like I think like when I think about it, one of the things I think is definitely the, a change, like new physical locations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: From a quiet office with a closed door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Oh, you mean at work, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, at work, yeah, so like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s also the apartment that I\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, that was also, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: That was a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: But yeah, so I went from like a pretty, a very quiet office it was either just me or me and one person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I remember it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: To\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: To the pentoctagon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. And like I know that\u2019s been wearing on me, but I\u2019ve been thinking like I think it\u2019s really, really been wearing on me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve also noticed that for whatever reason, maybe it\u2019s the pentoctagon, maybe it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t know. I can feel it. Like I\u2019ve been having an extra hard time dealing with like racial microagressions, or just aggressions in school, or like out and about. And this semester having like (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">at ) in class being really homophobic over this article. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">And it\u2019s definitely something, I mean, that will, that would piss me off regardless, like there is no (inaudible at ) that would not have made me angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: We are meaning to talk about that from school, can you remind me? I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was, you were supposed to read and critique an article which was a research article about do people get a different quality of service when they go to a reference desk asking about like, LGBT stuff, and it was, you know, about LGBTU, and was a really depressing, like I felt it was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">depressing.

Like this is stuff I know a lot about. It\u2019s not stuff that I know about through like, it\u2019s not my own personal experience, so like whatever, that will be fine. Except that like my knowledge and work and skill <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">or whatever got like ignored or belittled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: And I guess like that was definitely difficult in a, like it\u2019s not like my feelings are hurt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">Although they are, but it\u2019s also, I guess it\u2019s more like but there\u2019s this kind of empirical thing. Like I know a lot about, like I ran disability services for three years at a convention, so I know something about it. And just having people say, like just discuss it. Like not even say like well, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">was only, that was just volunteer work or whatever, just flat out ignoring it. I guess it\u2019s so like, with Will and despite his amazing blatantness -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: His amazing\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Like what I would say, it was just really blatant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Oh, blatantness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Blatant discrimination and crappiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: You know, I\u2019m kind of like yes, I guess I can\u2019t prove that I know more about this than Chet, fine.

No, it was, I mean, so they said to me, like when I said and I gave them a few like descriptions in (inaudible at ), it was like I just want a person of color, just give me one. It\u2019s like the, you know, person running it was like I\u2019m not sure, do you know if that person works at FAS? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">And I thought, I hope so, because what I was asking was for a person of color who has a professional level job. And I said I would take basically anyone except for finance, because I hate finance. And that person should exist, like that doesn\u2019t, because [] (sp?) was like, (inaudible at ), like my ideal? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">And I\u2019m like well, I really like an openly gay lesbian person.

And so she said, she\u2019s like, \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d So then I had to awesomely ask my coworkers if they knew any, which was really awkward and kind of, and of the like, I don\u2019t know, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">maybe five people, maybe. She was the best choice, but it was also a case of like some people said, like some people said, \u201cShe\u2019s kind of like a little socially awkward. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll,\u201d so I was like, \u201cWell, I guess like she fits something.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">And I, I also didn\u2019t like, kind of socially awkward is, you know\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Like not really into it, as I recall.

And I don\u2019t know why. I mean, it just makes it feel uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t actually know. So I was reading all these articles and I\u2019m trying this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">week to be just like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this just hasn\u2019t worked out.\u201d There\u2019s an end of program capstone lunch.

One of them was actually talking about consent. And I remember that the last year, and I think the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201091\">year before, the editors were very strongly trying to get me to write something, and I was like, I can\u2019t write anything, I\u2019m sorry. Like I was trying to see if I could like recycle, or like write. Now like two years ago, I was just like, I can\u2019t write, I\u2019m sorry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">And this last year, I said I couldn\u2019t write, but if you wanted to do a like an interview, like a question and answer, I could do that, but it just didn\u2019t happen. And that\u2019s also very, like it\u2019s probably, this is probably the longest stretch that I\u2019ve gone, like not really, like I\u2019m not cut, like I haven\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B1\">seen local friends, I haven\u2019t seen like my Internet friends. I haven\u2019t seen, and I just feel like I guess all the things, like the things that I do are things I think of, like the sort of things I do myself, I just haven\u2019t really been doing, and I haven\u2019t noticed how long it\u2019s been. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">Like one of my friends was like, yeah, I haven\u2019t seen you in three years. And he lives here. And mind you, he travels a lot, and blah, blah, blah, but it\u2019s just like, I mean, we argue about something that\u2019s not possible, like get the surgery. And someone else was like, \u201cI babysat for her.\u201d And I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">like, I haven\u2019t really talked to you since before you had this child who is four, like three or four. And like, we were never good friends, but it\u2019s still weird to be like, oh, you have a child. I barely remember, I barely even saw you like the mom being pregnant. I was just whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I guess I feel like I\u2019ve seen this in some ways here. Well the way that I\u2019ve seen it here is sort of, I don\u2019t remember exactly when it was that you decided to come in less often, but my recollection is that it was a lot because it was overwhelming to be coming here more often, that it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F1\">making you look too sad and too upset, most of the time upset as opposed to angry or anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: To be talking about things more often. And you seemed, I mean in recent months, I think, maybe a, I mean there was that one time where you were really upset after we met, and it lasted like a few days. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562402\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">And I guess my impression has been, like the feeling I\u2019ve gotten is that well, happily that hasn\u2019t happened in the same way, I think since then. That you\u2019re feeling like more recently overwhelmed, and thinner skinned in a way when it comes to talking about it. So I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t or you don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">try to, I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s like you feel kind of like it gets to be too much, or it really knocks you over. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: Much more easily than it used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: Definitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: And yeah, I don\u2019t understand all of it. I mean, I think I descriptively, I feel like I have, I hear what you\u2019re saying, I think we\u2019re pretty much on the same page, I\u2019m sure there are things I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: I mean, some of it certainly has got to be burnout and increasingly, like being increasingly worn down. Sometimes it\u2019s just kind of, it sort of gets worse, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that\u2019s also part of why the idea of like taking some time, a leave from work seems so appealing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: Because like whatever\u2019s going on, I just feel so unable to get a handle on what it is like I don\u2019t know. Like I don\u2019t know what the problem is. Like what\u2019s really starting this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I can describe like various things, but I couldn\u2019t tell you why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Right. I mean another sort of descriptive aspect of this, or like aspect of the fact that you described is it seems to me like the other things in your life have grown smaller and work has grown relatively bigger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">Over the last year or two, and that work has become unbearable in a way that it wasn\u2019t before.

You know, sort of fewer things outside of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah, and like I think in, I like tried to do more things outside of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: Like just, like I\u2019m okay, should I do whatever, and it\u2019s so exhausting and difficult and in ways where I\u2019m like I just don\u2019t get where that completely wore me out and I have to go lie down right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">CLIENT: Which also then like I get frustrated and sort of like a feedback loop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">CLIENT: But yeah, like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Have you, have you had a physical recently, like in the last six months?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">THERAPIST: Okay.

And so my doctor was like all right, we\u2019re just going to start going through a ton of stuff, so it was like blood tests, urine <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201451\">tests, blah, blah, blah, saw an endocrinologist. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">So there was all of that and then there was my blood pressure has been going up, so and I was kind of like, I think I\u2019m also super anxious at the doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">CLIENT: So she asked me to like take my blood pressure different times of the day and different days of the week. And the answer is my blood pressure goes up a lot during the work week. And a lot. And my doctor\u2019s like yeah, so if I could prescribe you not being stressed over, and so they checked my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B1\">thyroid among other silly things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562402\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">And yeah, like I\u2019ve, it\u2019s funny, because I was really concerned about this wedding, but, because it\u2019s so frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Sorry, could we go back? So did people not know about Wellbutrin being the cause of that? Or do you know that was part of it but weren\u2019t sure that it was also something else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: I was hoping it was also something else because it\u2019s just so out of control sometimes. Like, like just sweat pouring down my face, and people like commenting on it at the store, or whatever, or having a hard time giving a presentation because I\u2019m like, my face is just streaming with sweat. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201511\">not useful. So yeah, I was hoping it was something else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Not so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: Right, and so if I, from indicating that your blood pressure goes way up at work, things looked okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Well I\u2019m glad things were okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s one of those things where I\u2019m like yeah, my, the thing that freaked me out about the blood pressure is that I\u2019ve always had like low blood pressure is great. I get my cholesterol and like blah, blah, blah. And so to have it get worse over like a year, or a year and a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D1\">half maybe, and have it be just work like was very <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">THERAPIST: So (inaudible at ), with your cousin, but as your plan would be sometime in the next month or two to go out on leave for about three months, and then like let\u2019s say June, July, and August, and then come back and do September through December, at which point you\u2019ll be done with office school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">CLIENT: If I took a leave, I\u2019d actually just finish office school during the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: I mean, assuming that, let me rephrase that. In theory, like assuming I could cope with taking class in the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: Right. Like taking one class?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">CLIENT: It would be yeah, it\u2019s one class left. So I could either not take a class or take a class. I could take a class or not during the summer. If I take a class in the summer, I\u2019d be done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">CLIENT: Which is why I\u2019m sort of like, mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Right. And then would you start looking for other jobs? I mean\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah. The, like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: My supporting you on this leave isn\u2019t contingent on any of this. I\u2019m just sort of asking what you\u2019re thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah. Unfortunately -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Like if a thing like this would help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: What I\u2019m feeling right now is like I would like to apply for a new job right now, except that I don\u2019t think that I could actually get through applying for a job right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Especially, I think I would, for a variety of reasons, it would probably be a horrible interview, so yeah. Like assuming that I can get a new job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">That\u2019s what I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">THERAPIST: Right. Basically as soon as you go up to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah, the concept of applying for jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">THERAPIST: It seems sensible to me, we do need to stop for now. I don\u2019t have the sense that this is something that you\u2019re going to like apply for this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">CLIENT: No, I mean I\u2019m still not hearing from (inaudible at ), so that\u2019s still something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: So no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Right.
