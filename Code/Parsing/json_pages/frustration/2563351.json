She got to meet my friend Carly. She really loved her. We went to Ikea, the three of us. And Carly was just being funny and cracking my mom up and\u2026 She just gets a kick out of meeting my friends, and knowing that I have good people here that I feel close <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">to and that are good people. Because she pictures me I think like all by myself, \u201cOh, my daughter who\u2019s all by herself in DC.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: So I feel like friends are family you choose.

So Carly, she\u2019s 20 now. She\u2019s very mature. She recently called me before my mom came into town and said to me, \u201cMelanie, I have this situation. My boyfriend\u2026,\u201d who is this Italian guy named Diego, who my mom totally dislikes, because he\u2019s not White and Jewish and an aspiring professional. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">\u201cMy boyfriend got me a night in one of the Disney resorts, and he plans to take me to the park during the day. And then we\u2019re going to, you know, enjoy the pool at the hotel, and spend the night, and get up and have breakfast there. Like he planned this beautiful weekend for us.\u201d Like wow, shit, I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200552\">that. Like that sounds awesome. That\u2019s cute that he did that for you. He works like every weekend, so I guess he saved money. But she\u2019s like, \u201cBut the thing is, I want to be honest with Mommy and tell her. So should I tell her? What should I do?\u201d And I said, \u201cI mean, she\u2019s not going to not allow you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200553\">to go, you\u2019re 20 years old. Just keep in mind though, even though she already knows you\u2019re having sex, it\u2019s going to be really weird for her to imagine you in a hotel room with a guy.\u201d [0:04:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: \u201cLike just know there\u2019s no turning back from that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: So she\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d So she decides to confront my mom about it.

I don\u2019t\u2026 You know, I think you should really reconsider that.\u201d And when my mom was here I asked her, you know, \u201cHow are you feeling about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">that?\u201d And she was just so\u2026 raw. And it kind of like grossed me out, like what came out of her mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Because I was like, \u201cI know you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable with it, but how\u2019s it going?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh! It just\u2026 I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d She called her a \u201c[].\u201d Like that\u2019s what she used to call me when I was a kid, like a pain in the ass kid. And she\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: With that kind of valence to it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, like, why is she making my life more difficult?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Oh. Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: And she said\u2026 yeah, just, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so bothered.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, let\u2019s think about it. Like what part about that whole situation bothers you the most?\u201d And this is the part that I\u2019m just like, Ew! Ugh! Don\u2019t want to think about that. She said, \u201cWell, I know they\u2019re probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">going to go to the hotel, and like take off their clothes, and take a shower together, and then have sex all night.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cLike adults do.\u201d You know. And she\u2019s like, \u201cExactly! And she\u2019s not an adult.\u201d But like she\u2019s kind of torturing herself by picturing the deep\u2026 Like I don\u2019t even want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D2\">picture that. Because Carly\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: But she pictures it with that kind of vivid\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s not a repressive barrier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: And it just grossed me out. And it made me think about like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really an interesting observation. [0:06:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: \u2026 stuff that tortures her, and how she must have\u2026 I remember once when I was living with Kevin already, and I would come home once in a while\u2026 No, I wasn\u2019t living with Kevin. This is when they moved away and I had an apartment of my own, but she kind of knew that Kevin would spend the night <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">occasionally. And so one weekend when I went to visit them I brought my laundry with me. And she did my laundry, because she wants to, she takes, you know, pleasure in just taking care of me like that. But then when she was folding my laundry she was like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so disgusting me. Like I picture <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200792\">your sheets, and I picture your underwears, and like how he must sleep over.\u201d I\u2019m like, oh my God, this is like too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: And my mom is very much like that. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t want us having sex, she doesn\u2019t want to know about it, but yet like look at the vivid images that go through her mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, yeah, and as if they\u2019re\u2026 it\u2019s partially probably the reason why. Like in some way she\u2019s hit so raw as you put it, like it\u2019s so raw to her, it\u2019s so felt and thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Like even wonder, I started wondering, like is it okay if you do that? Like what about you and Billy? Like I just wonder what her own mentality of her sexuality is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Oh, for herself. What\u2019s okay for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: I was thinking too, but what about\u2026 also what about a younger girl being in that situation?

She was saying how much Carly reminds her of herself as a young girl. She\u2019s like, \u201cYou know how Carly is very mature, and like just flighty and out of it, and she\u2019s kinda like an airhead, and knows nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">about life. I was exactly like that.\u201d [0:08:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Mm, mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: And she got married like when she was 21, 22. Like I can\u2019t imagine Carly married a year or two from now. But it makes sense. Like she\u2019s always talked about herself like, \u201cI didn\u2019t like school, I didn\u2019t like to study. I didn\u2019t clean my room, I was irresponsible. Just like Carly.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, in some ways she kind of puts herself in the state of mind of a\u2026 almost like a child and sexuality. You know what I mean? Like there is something like\u2026 As you\u2019re sort of pointing out, like she can\u2019t be thinking about it that way with Billy. It must be a kind of a different kinda\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: But I wonder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Well, you wonder. But the way she described it is almost like the\u2026 kinda the\u2026 the recoiling-ness of like\u2026 of a girl. You know, it\u2019s almost like how a young girl would think about those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Like sheets and, you know, sex\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Underwear and\u2026 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: \u2026 and panties, and all that stuff.

The other thing that was really weird is\u2026 so we found a great breakfast place around the corner from my house, and super cheap. Like you can get this huge breakfast for like six bucks. Perfect. Saving money. But then during the breakfast she said something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A51\">to me like, \u201cRemind me when we get to the car I have to tell you something I\u2019ve never told anyone before. But I can\u2019t say it here or else I\u2019ll start crying.\u201d And I felt like almost like a wave of anxiety come over me, and I felt like I do when I have clients in session and they tell me, \u201cI\u2019ve never <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A52\">told anyone this before, but I need to say something.\u201d Like it makes me nervous to a certain\u2026 Like I can handle, but I always like, \u201cOh my God, this is important, this information I\u2019m about to receive. But this is my mother, and I\u2019m not in therapy right now.\u201d And was just like uneasy. [0:10:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">And we get into the car, and she says, \u201cYou know, sometimes I wonder if I should tell my brothers about something that happened to me when I was a little girl.\u201d And I\u2019m like getting all these ideas, like maybe she\u2019s going to tell me that her father molested her, like her brothers molested her. What\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">going on? And so she said, \u201cDid I ever tell you that we had like a family birthday party, I must have been like six years old,\u201d and some guy who was like probably 19 or 20, a friend of her brothers\u2019, who were much older than her, they were like 16 by the time she was six. She said, \u201cDid I ever tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A72\">you like he fondled me. He like touched me.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019ve told me this.\u201d When I was 16 I remember we both got really, really drunk, and that\u2019s when she told me that she\u2026 that happened to her, and that she was raped. But that\u2019s like the only other time she\u2019s mentioned that. So I was like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: The incident when she was six, or the rape?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, the six. The six year old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: And I was like, \u201cYou\u2019ve told me this.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cOh. But did I tell you what happened after that?\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I just had this horrible guilt, because I ended up\u2026 as the party was wrapping up I told my mom and dad\u2026 I told my mom what happened, \u2018That <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">guy touched me.\u2019 And my mom told my dad, and my dad was like drunk and pissed. So he\u2019s like, \u2018Who is it? Tell me who it is, I\u2019m gonna kill him.\u2019\u201d And my mom pointed at some guy with a hat, and it seems like the guy that touched her had taken off his hat and given it to someone else, so she pointed at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">the wrong guy, and my grandpa started beating him up. And she feels horribly guilty for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Mm, wow. [0:12:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: And I kind of helped her just explore how\u2026 like as a little girl, I can imagine\u2026 you know, what other choice do you have? Like, \u201cWhoops, I made a mistake, never mind.\u201d Like with your dad being that impulsive and flying off the handle. Like maybe he would have attacked you or gotten mad at you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">if you would have admitted like, Wow, I made a mistake. So. But then she said, \u201cYeah, have I told you that?\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah, you actually did tell me that too.\u201d Like it\u2019s like ingrained in my memory because it\u2019s the only time she ever told me about this stuff. And she said, \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B32\">if I should have told my brothers.\u201d Because her brothers remained friends with this person for the rest of their lives. And in fact she had to interact with him again, like at gatherings and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Wow. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: So we were kinda talking like, \u201cWell, what would that accomplish? Would that make you feel better somehow?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: There\u2019s just so much unprocessed stuff there. She\u2019s a tortured soul. And Carly called my crying just like two days ago. She\u2019s like, \u201cI went to go say good morning to mommy, and I was in a good mood and everything, and out of nowhere she\u2019s like, \u2018Carly, I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">think you should go on that trip to the Disney hotel. I\u2019m very uncomfortable, I haven\u2019t been able to sleep for days.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Wow. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: And then I get a text on like my other messenger thing that says\u2014from my mom\u2014\u201dMelanie, are you awake? Can I talk to you? I haven\u2019t been able to sleep. I\u2019m so anxious.\u201d And it\u2019s because of this thing with Carly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

When she was recounting this\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: That was why, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: It must be kicking up a lot of stuff for her. You know, as a young girl, you know, becoming sexually active, that being in her head. Wow. [0:14:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: And Billy doesn\u2019t know. And so she\u2019s holding all this on her own as a parent. Billy is under the assumption that Carly\u2019s a virgin. In fact, who knows if it\u2019s just denial or if he really is na\u00efve and just doesn\u2019t know. Because every time\u2026 She goes through boyfriends like every month. And every <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">time she gets dumped, which usually is what happens, Billy says, \u201cOh, I suspect what\u2019s happening is she\u2019s refusing to have sex with them and that\u2019s why they\u2019re dumping her.\u201d Which plays into that image of like she\u2019s an angel, she\u2019s good, she\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: \u2026 untainted. And so my mom says, you know, \u201cI could never tell Billy about it, he\u2019d have a heart attack.\u201d Like it just would blow his mind, he couldn\u2019t handle it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: So she\u2019s keeping that from him and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s really hard for her. Because like there\u2019s something, as you were putting it, like raw and un\u2026 well, unrepressed in some way. It\u2019s almost like Billy has that kind of repression that a lot of fathers have about their daughters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You know. But not so with your mom maybe. It\u2019s like too much in your face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: She was like that with me as a teenager too, and it just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: It weirded me out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I got it. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: But then with her own sexuality, like when she would become uninhibited and drunk for example, it\u2019d be like just in your face. Remember I told you that story how we went to the beach. And this was like a few months after she got her implants, so I must have been like 16. And she was with my <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">aunt, my aunt was driving the car out of the beach, and they had been drinking on the beach all day. And so my mom like stated blasting the music, and like took off her top and like flashed everyone. Like in public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: You know, and\u2026 Or she\u2019d make really perverted jokes. Especially when she\u2019s drunk. Like she said something\u2026 When I took her to dinner we had two margaritas, and it hits her really hard, and she was just like\u2026 I forget what comment she made, but she said something that I was like, okay, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F31\">gross. Like it\u2019s too raw. [0:16:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: It was gross to\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s too raw and in your face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: I mean, if it was my friend. Like Carly and I talk like that all the time. My friend Carly. But my mother, it\u2019s just\u2026 And we can talk about adult stuff, but I don\u2019t know, she like crosses the line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there\u2019s something about the way\u2026 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: And I find myself redirecting the conversation to kind of like contain it. Because it could blow up, I could add fuel to the fire and probably engage in a really inappropriate conversation with my mom. But I don\u2019t want to go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Oh, you mean you could kind of\u2026 yeah, if you guys were friends or something you\u2019d\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: Or if I had no boundaries.

Unless she says something, you know, like what she said about Carly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right. Right, where she can\u2019t help it. Almost, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: She kept making jokes the whole time. And looking at the weather channel, like, \u201cOh, maybe there\u2019ll be a snowstorm the day I have to leave.\u201d Because she was hoping her flight would be delayed or canceled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: And then she said something like, \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d She takes a lot of medications, like for migraines, for her depression, her anxiety, her panic. Like she has pills for everything. And she said something like, \u201cYou know, before leaving the house I took my pill box, and I said, \u2018Oh, I need to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">just the right amount for the right amount of days.\u2019 But then I decided to bring like five days extra or something just in case.\u201d She just has\u2026 Like I hear it in so much that she\u2019s saying, she has a wish to just live with me.

I don\u2019t need anything to stir up anything. I don\u2019t know why they want to see me.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B2\">their sister.

[0:21:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah, as if something about seeing her brothers is gonna stir\u2026 rock the boat for her, stir up trouble or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s very raw about seeing those brothers maybe for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I remember years ago, like five, six years ago, I happened to be visiting while her Chilean\u2026 the one that lives in Chile was visiting Alabama for some reason. And he spent like a night or two at my mom\u2019s house, so we were all spending, you know, time under the same roof. And she freaked <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B1\">out. Like they were having a talk in the kitchen or something, then he went to bed, and then I went to the kitchen to get a drink, and she was like freaked out. And she looked like a deer in headlights. And I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cSomething weird just happened and I don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B2\">to make of it. And it like made me feel really weird, and it reminded me of things from the past.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I was just talking to my brother in here and\u2026\u201d You know, she was wearing like a T-shirt, because it was time to go to sleep and she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B3\">And it seems like he was like using his hands to talk and must have bumped into her breast somehow. And she said that that like\u2026 she didn\u2019t know what to do. Like she froze.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: Like there\u2019s so many issues with sexuality with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">THERAPIST: What did you make of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I started asking her, like do you think it brought back some kind of memory? Like do you think\u2026 How did it make you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: She\u2019s like, \u201cIt just made me feel so uncomfortable, and I just like froze. I was just like, get out of here, run.\u201d You know, like it just\u2026 it had a trauma feel to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: And I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I wonder if he\u2019s ever been inappropriate with you, or if it\u2019s just bringing up a lot of\u2026 because you\u2019ve had other experiences that have been really inappropriate so\u2026 that you haven\u2019t talked about a lot.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But it was her brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: It was her brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah. And another thing, like\u2026 So that brother\u2019s son, who is now like 36 or something, my cousin [one? 0:23:11], once we were all at a family gathering, and\u2026 I don\u2019t think I was there. No, I wasn\u2019t there. But my mom told me about it afterwards. And she said that they were all drinking, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201511\">that\u2019s what my family does when they get together. And she said that Oscar came up to her like to have a heart to heart, and he like put his arm around her shoulder, and I guess she was wearing shorts, and he was like going like that to her. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God, it made me feel so uncomfortable, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201512\">and I just froze. Like there was something so inappropriate about what he was doing.\u201d Like I know Oscar, like I don\u2019t think he meant it that way. But like she just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20150-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20150-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah, she just really responded strongly to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah. So there\u2019s been a lot of situations like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: Um\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, her body\u2019s responding to something, that\u2019s for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel so bad. Like I wish I could give her therapy. I can\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t want to. But she needs it, she needs some good therapy. Maybe in her old age when she is like living near me I\u2019ll pay for some good therapy for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah. Boy, it\u2019s all right there on the surface to her though. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a lot of digging that needs to be done, she\u2019s really\u2026 And for her part too, you know, it sounds like she\u2019s trying to make sense of it. You know, asking questions and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">THERAPIST: Or at least talking about it as if it\u2019s puzzling to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: Over the years it\u2019s increased, like because she knows what I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">CLIENT: You know, and she knows how I think. So I think just sharing with her my work and psychology in general she\u2019s become more curious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">THERAPIST: I was thinking the same thing, that you\u2019ve kind of influenced her to be more curious about herself. [0:25:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah. Another thing I wanted to bring up, and this has to do with just how poor models my parents are of like just maintaining good family relationships. So Billy has his mother, Olive. Have I mentioned her in here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that you have, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it\u2019s his biological mother. His parents got divorced when he was like six, and she didn\u2019t get custody because supposedly she was a floozy. She was sleeping around with the whole neighborhood and the neighbor. So dad got custody. And then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: She would do things like say, \u201cI\u2019m gonna come pick you up,\u201d and just would never show up. Or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: They never really lived with her. And she was very passive aggressive, and just nasty, that\u2019s how he describes her. And he has a very nasty relationship with her. Like he will insult her, hang up the phone on her. And she\u2019s been living in North Carolina the past few years, alone in an apartment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D1\">And she\u2019s a pain in the ass. But I can\u2019t be mean to people. So once in a while\u2014and I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s lonely\u2014she sends gifts from QVC. Like she spends her life watching QVC, and sends me weird things, like a portable battery for my cell phone, or coat hangers, or\u2026 just weird stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Coat hangers, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s so sad. Because she does that in order to get people to call her. Like because then I have to call and say, \u201cThank you for the gift,\u201d and that\u2019s how she draws people in. And I don\u2019t like talking to her, because every time I talk to her she\u2019s very inappropriate. Like she\u2019ll say stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201811\">like\u2026 She\u2019ll start off fine, \u201cHow is everything? How are you? My health is bad.\u201d Always her health is bad. But then she\u2019ll asking questions like, \u201cSo what\u2019s Billy doing for money?\u201d You know. \u201cHe\u2019s not working is he? What are they living off of? Do you think like your mom\u2019s father is still sending her <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201812\">money? Does that still happen? Like did he leave or something, what?\u201d Just like, this is none of your business. And it\u2019s none of my business technically. Like don\u2019t talk to me about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">THERAPIST: Very gossipy kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">CLIENT: Yes. And it puts me in a bad place and\u2026 So what happened recently, from what I heard, is Billy got into a horrible fight with Olive. Because she insults him. Like this is their relationship, they\u2019ll get along and laugh and everything, but then once in a while she just becomes nasty, and he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201851\">like, \u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m not talking to you anymore for a few months.\u201d So he said something to her about a suggestion for some kind of business or something, and she said to him like, \u201cPft! What do you know about business?\u201d And that was like the biggest insult you could give Billy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">CLIENT: Because like he prides himself on like, \u201cI\u2019m a businessman, I\u2019m a salesman.\u201d Yeah. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re cutting him off at the knees. [0:28:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">CLIENT: So he said, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you anymore,\u201d and basically blocked her number. So she\u2019s been calling Carly and I practically every day and leaving messages, and saying, \u201cMelanie, what\u2019s going on with Mommy and Daddy, they\u2019re not picking up the phone? I\u2019m very worried, what\u2019s going on?\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D1\">obviously she knows what\u2019s going on, they got into a fight and he\u2019s not talking to you. But it\u2019s hard, it puts me in a bad position, because I\u2019m not naturally rude. Like I don\u2019t just not call people. And I feel bad for her, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to be dragged into this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">So I asked my mom, right before she came to see me\u2014and I could hear Billy in the background\u2014I said, \u201cMommy, can you tell Billy to please like call his mom.\u201d And I\u2019ve heard from Carly also that Olive won\u2019t stop calling her. Like she keeps calling us, like can you say, \u201cLook, Melanie and Carly don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F1\">to be rude, but they don\u2019t want to get in the middle of this. You\u2019re having a fight with your son.\u201d And so I heard her put the phone down and say this to Billy, and say, \u201cBilly, can you call your mom and tell her to stop calling?\u201d And like a kid having a tantrum, he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not calling her! I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F2\">not calling my mother!\u201d [pause] Like are you serious? So I\u2019m just going to have to eat it, like just deal with it, and keep on ignoring her calls. Like you\u2019re not being the adult here. Like I\u2019m not even the granddaughter, I\u2019m the step-granddaughter. Like I have nothing to do with this woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, right, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just like\u2026 it\u2019s like a child.

And leaving you to kind of figure it out for yourself, or not a lot of guidance from them, or kind of like a feeling that there\u2019s a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">CLIENT: Like he told me\u2026 he said something the other day like, \u201cWell, just pick up the phone next time she calls and say, \u2018God damn it, don\u2019t call me anymore!\u2019\u201d And I was like, \u201cBilly, I don\u2019t have that relationship with her. I don\u2019t do that, I\u2019m not going to talk to her that way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

Like I\u2019ve always <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF1\">wanted to do little things like that, you know, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">CLIENT: Um\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, like what did we do? On Saturday night we hung out at his place a little bit, and then went out to dinner. And we were making fun\u2026 well, I was making fun of the area. Because I was like, \u201cI want to meet some of these Bunker Hill women.\u201d Because like I\u2019ve seen Ted, and that girl was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201D71\">\u201cDon\u2019t you come into Bunker Hill.\u201d So I was like\u2026 He took me to a bar, and like there was a rough crowd. Then we got food. And then we watched\u2026 like rented a movie at his place and saw the movie. And sleep was\u2026 nice. Like I was able to feel comfortable\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB\">CLIENT: \u2026 and feel perfectly at peace, and like it felt really good. I think it\u2019s just that we\u2019re both new to each other, so I kept on waking up. Like every time he moved or shifted I got like self-conscious, like oh my God, am I sweating, am I drooling? Like what\u2019s happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.

And that\u2019s when\u2026 Like for the first time I wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF1\">in it as much as I was like analyzing what was going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">CLIENT: And then I remember looking up at James, and it was like total difference.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20213\">CLIENT: And\u2026 It\u2019s not that it was terrible, it wasn\u2019t. But it just wasn\u2019t the same. And I know that we\u2019re just getting to know each other, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s gonna call me names and pull my hair. Like, you know, little things that might turn me on, he\u2019s not gonna do that like the first time. But then <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202131\">what was interesting is\u2026 so we parted ways, and the next day he texted me good morning, I said good morning. And he said, \u201cAre you feeling okay? Because I woke up really, really sick.\u201d It was like, \u201cI\u2019m fine, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20215\">THERAPIST: He said that he woke up really sick?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20217\">CLIENT: He woke up really sick. And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I have like a bug or something. Like as soon as you left I was throwing up nonstop. I can\u2019t eat anything, I can\u2019t keep anything down.\u201d And I felt really bad, and I started wondering, like, oh my God, am I sick? But I wasn\u2019t, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202171\">I didn\u2019t get sick. Something was going around. And he works with kids, so he probably had something. And he didn\u2019t text a lot, because he was sleeping basically for the next two days. And I remember just feeling an unease. Like I never feel uneasy or uncomfortable or in a bad mood, and I was kinda moody. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202172\">And I kept on asking myself, like what\u2019s going on right now? And I only noticed like a few days later when he was feeling\u2026 coming out of the flu and feeling better that he started texting me, using humor, and, \u201cWhen can I see you again?\u201d that I was like, \u201cWhew!\u201d [wiping sweat off forehead sound]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20219\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021B\">CLIENT: I think it was some kind of feeling of separation\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2021A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F\">CLIENT: \u2026 that freaked me out a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20221\">THERAPIST: But how to take that kind of\u2026 It sounded like you felt like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20223\">CLIENT: Yes.

Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20227\">CLIENT: Even though it\u2019s not his fault he got sick, but\u2026 So Carly\u2019s hypothesis is\u2026 she\u2019s like, \u201cYou know how you said you weren\u2019t too into it? Maybe you were more into it than you thought. And so that\u2019s why that separation kind of freaked you out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20229\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. No, how to make\u2026 yeah, what\u2026 yeah, like\u2026 I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019re making\u2026 how you\u2019re making sense of like not hearing from him as much. I mean, knowing on one level he was sick. [0:38:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B\">CLIENT: I knew he was sick.

Mm hm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">CLIENT: Like seriously, this guy is like marriage material.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">THERAPIST: Well, something too might be opening up for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">CLIENT: Yeah, but then we don\u2019t have time to get into this. But I have a big problem, because I told Brian, which I think was brave, but not so brave, because he ended up kind of getting off to the idea. But I ended up telling him. And it was interesting the way I did it, because we were talking on <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202371\">the phone, or this was over texts or something. Over texts is just less threatening for him. And so I said something like, \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d And he put, \u201cUh oh, I think I already know.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no, go ahead, tell me.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I met someone.\u201d He\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202372\">like, \u201cYeah, I figured, because you took your profile down.\u201d And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cSo you\u2019re still on it. You\u2019re still checking my profile.\u201d I didn\u2019t even meet him on OkCupid, I met him on eHarmony. Which\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">So anyways, so I said to Brian, like, \u201cIf you noticed that why didn\u2019t you ask me about it?\u201d Well, we know this. Because Brian doesn\u2019t talk about hard topics. But I was like, \u201cLook, what\u2019s happening is this isn\u2019t even a relationship yet.\u201d I think this was before we had sex. Like this was on the second <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202391\">date or something that I told Brian, \u201cLook, I met someone.\u201d And I said, \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 We get along pretty well, and I think\u2026 He\u2019s just wanting to offer me a lot of the things that I\u2019ve been waiting for you to give me.\u201d And I almost felt like it was a plea, like step up before it\u2019s too late. Like I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202392\">say it in those words, but I felt like that\u2019s what I was telling him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah? [0:40:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">CLIENT: Nothing changed. In fact he\u2026 I didn\u2019t hear from him like for a few days. He said he got sick, and I believe it, because there\u2019s some bug going around, I know a bunch of people that are sick. And then he worked a horrible schedule. And then today I get a text that says, \u201cMommy is in the hospital.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D1\">It\u2019s interesting how he put that, \u201cMommy is in the hospital.\u201d So I questioned myself like, is he talking about his mom, or his wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s what I was wondering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20241\">CLIENT: He\u2019s talking about his wife.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20243\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20245\">CLIENT: And he was like, \u201cYeah, she\u2019s having some major issues, she might have to have a hysterectomy and a transfusion.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cGeez. Are you worried?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cAh, a little bit.\u201d And I was like, \u201cIs this part of the reason why you\u2019ve disappeared? Like it sounds like you\u2019ve been dealing <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202451\">with a lot. Where\u2019s the foster kid? Like this must be a pain. And you\u2019re worried about her.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, I told you, I got sick and I had a busy work schedule.\u201d So he didn\u2019t give me much. And we haven\u2019t talked about\u2026 he hasn\u2019t asked me about\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20244-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20244-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563351\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20247\">THERAPIST: About the James situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20249\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024D\">CLIENT: But right away he turns to sex, and it\u2019s so unhealthy.

Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20255\">CLIENT: And he was very angry. And I was exhausted. Because like we had celebrated the Super Bowl like just eating junk, and drinking beer. And so by the time I got to my house I was just like spent. So I just remember last night him texting me like, \u201cI\u2019m very angry, but you need to go to sleep.\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202551\">said, \u201cYes, I need to go to sleep.\u201d And then suddenly my phone rings and it\u2019s him.
