I mean, it's really nice to hear \"I'm sorry that you're feeling that way,\" but it doesn't really do much for me. I guess it would be more helpful (inaudible 23:15). I don't know. (Pause) I know. I know it sucks. Like, from all the ways in which you could know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">because you know me, because you know (inaudible 23:51) what this is like because you've been through it, or because you (pause) you have to listen to what I have to say, and you feel it.

(Long pause) I really wish there was sort of more I could do to (inaudible 24:52), but I (pause) know that this is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I know I at least feel like I'm I feel like I'm pretty tuned into about how you're feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I (inaudible 25:19) in a not (inaudible 25:27) way.

Like, I think we're probably sometimes realizing it and sometimes not. You're kind of trying to, like, figure out where the fuck I'm coming from already and get me to open up. And I sort of, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">tarry over there and tarry over there and tarry over here. Or, like, you know, sometimes like now, kind of step a little bit to the side of it and say what I think is going on. But I think that's all sort of the energy for that, some motivation for that, which is probably conscious, but probably something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">that happens, and you're not even intending for it to happen is your, like, sadness and frustration. And that it probably like, you may know in your head that there's a point, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like that way, I'm sure, a lot of the time. It just feels, like, fucking frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Like, I mean, to be a little silly about it. Like, there's a bunch of cookies. Cookies are good. We like cookies. Let's talk about the cookies. (Laughter) They're Oreo cookies. They're chocolate chip cookies. They are lemon squares. They are all these brownies. They are always different kinds <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">of treat and sweets and cookies. Let's look at them, you know. (Laughter) Like, fuck. You know, what the hell are you doing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: But it doesn't feel like I have a choice. Like, it's like, \"Well, just don't come to the cookie room.\" There a lot of days where I wake up and I'm like, \"I'm not going back.\" Not because of anything except that I don't want to be subject to investigation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You're sick of the goddamn cookie room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think the reason why I do come back is because (pause) it's not like I'm at peace outside this room either, with this. So might as well come tell you about it and see how far I can get in getting you to do all the things I want you to do. Kind of like a fun challenge, to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but what you really want is some relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: And..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I'm just explaining, like, why the choice between not coming and coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I understand.

And for me, (pause) I don't feel like this all the time at all. Sometimes it feels (inaudible 32:24), but most of the time, I feel like this way. It feels (inaudible 32:27), which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">is, like, a little bit frustrating because it's not bringing me to a crisis where I can just, like, quit everything and pay attention to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Or you can stop living with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Like when you're not sort of physically sick enough to stay home from work and just whatever, but you are enough to (inaudible 32:53).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: So (pause) I sort of feel like I've done everything I want to do, and I don't know what's left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: With regard to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: My life. And, like, that sounds however it sounds, and that's why I practiced it with it's mild and it doesn't bring me to a crisis point, and it doesn't happen all the time. But we can (inaudible 33:32). So, like, maybe part of it is a feeling of being, like, academically satisfied, and I, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">like, jump through all the hoops. And, like, it's fine. I did it. And, like, now what's left is pure curiosity, and that is really great. And sometimes it's enough to drive me to want to work and be a scientist. And sometimes, like, I'm tired, and I don't want to do that. So that's, like, that part. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">Like, I don't care about getting a job. I don't care about making money.
