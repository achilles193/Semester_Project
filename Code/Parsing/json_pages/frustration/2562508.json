(long pause) They spent a lot of time together.  (long pause) How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m fine, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: You\u2019re welcome. (long pause)  It\u2019s really pretty hard for me to be away from you. (pause)  I don\u2019t know what I struggle more with \u2013 being away from you or the struggle. (long pause)  (inaudible at 00:07:10), in case you were wondering. (long pause)  I have a new friend. Her name is Peg and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">is a keyboard. Our latest domestic argument in the last month or so has been do we get a real piano or do we get a full-sized digital keyboard. It took about a month for Jeremy to convince me that I didn\u2019t want a real piano, which was surprising. And it took about a month for me to get him to agree <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">that we would look for the next place with getting a real piano at the front and top of the list \u2013 or like it would be up there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">Peg is a $2,000 chord, stage, vintage-one digital keyboard, who has all this cool functionality beyond being designed to feel like a real piano, like the keys are weighted, their velocity and feel of the keys are very, very similar to that.  It\u2019s pretty impressive. It\u2019s full-sized, 88 keys, so it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">five-feet long, and she has all these cool jazz sounds that, if you were a jazz pianist and you want to play anything other than a real piano, you would get this keyboard for your performances. So that\u2019s really, really cool. You sort of just play any note and you feel the groove. It\u2019s pretty neat, really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">because it sounds so nice. (pause)  We\u2019ve both been playing her pretty much since we got her Saturday, through midnight last night, alternating. The other one is usually waiting to get on and it\u2019s been really fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">It makes me really happy to have a piano again or a piano-like piano. (pause) Part of my argument for convincing Jeremy why I needed to get one now felt really desperate, like it\u2019s been so long without one that I really feel the void.  It felt a little dramatic at the time, but now that I have one, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">it\u2019s really clear to both of us what that void was. She\u2019s the transition absorber for me. It has been since I was five. It\u2019s a very, very wrong relationship. I think I spent more time with our piano when I was upset than with any person in my house, like lots of tears at that piano . . .  Lots of stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">comes up and moves through really fluidly. It\u2019s me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Sounds great. I think Peg is a lovely addition to your household.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, she\u2019s a great friend. We were discussing whether she\u2019s our baby; and she\u2019s not at all. She\u2019s a companion. I\u2019m not used to naming things, but Jeremy\u2019s family names stuff, so we\u2019re trying.  Peg is a really natural name because of the keyboard and the stand and the speakers and the speaker <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">stand and cables, the most exciting thing of that for me was the Steely Dan complete repertoire book. Do you know who Steely Dan is? You should check them out. I\u2019ve been wanting to play their music for a while, but it\u2019s very moving. It will be [good to have a book.] (ph?) My favorite song of theirs <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">is (inaudible at 00:19:56). (pause) I guess I thought for a second that maybe you don\u2019t want me to have a transition absorber.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562508\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Humph.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I thought of that while I was telling you that. Maybe that\u2019s the hard-hearted Jay persona that I was responding to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I see. Like you should sit in a bare room and feel the transitions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yep. Yep. (pause) I went to that piano like 12 times in the 24 hours that we had her. There is really nothing else. I don\u2019t think there is one antidote to anxiety, but music comes pretty close for me.  Somehow, just noodling around with the piano feels the best so far because that\u2019s a lot of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: A lot of time to talk to someone or pick some recorded music to play or to sit or do anything. And it\u2019s a lot of time to feel a transition. I think most of the times I did feel a transition, but not all of them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It was a really nice thing for Peg. She was there every damned time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: She was. She\u2019s so inviting and she\u2019s like a portal. She just assumes whatever vessel that I need her to every time. It\u2019s different every time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: No you\u2019re not playing this song this time, Allison. I don\u2019t want you to play it. I want you to play this other song.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yep. (pause) I think it\u2019s why my mom sounded so happy. I think she may be the one who really gets it, like how important our piano was for me when I was growing up. (pause) I had the thought that maybe you were thinking she really gets it because she was acutely aware of how much I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">wasn\u2019t with her or wasn\u2019t coming to her at all of those times. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I guess, again, it\u2019s sort of me apparently looking a little bit at the more negative side or painful side, I think. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: There is something very rhythmic and chant-like about the times when I play in response or as a way to receive difficult emotions.  I can really just play two notes (inaudible at 00:26:14). I did it for half an hour last night. Or I start with two notes and then just sort of see where it goes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">but then go back to the two notes. It\u2019s soothing or something and it\u2019s also \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s like steadying. (long pause)  I wonder if you feel outside or inside of this. (long pause)  You seem unsettled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I feel unsettled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You feel unsettled?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Sometimes you seem unsettled when I feel (inaudible at 00:31:45).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I seem unsettled as you also feel unsettled? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I revisited some older relationships with music teachers this weekend and realized how transferrential or like how they are really little baby transferrentials. We had so much in common with it and with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: My sense is that you\u2019re maybe unsettled and I am apparently unsettled by your bringing Peg into things.  I think my sense is that you feel like, in a way, it puts something a little in between us and it\u2019s something that, among other things, helps you when I am not there and is really nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">and that, at the same time, it feels like a bit of distance or difference between you and me and that that raises the question of whether we can be as close or this can be the same and how is that going to affect me and I\u2019m probably unsettled. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562508\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why because I\u2019m not pretending to know why you\u2019re unsettled. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because you\u2019re worried that Peg is coming between us. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: No. I\u2019m saying I think you feel like I am more immune the same way like with your mother. You imagined I was thinking that she was acutely aware of how you were going to the piano and not to her. You are imagining that I am acutely aware of you are going to the piano and not to me and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">you imagined that I\u2019m unsettled by that.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Maybe. I think you\u2019re right about all the other stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: We have about five minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t have any ideas that feel at the surface about why you\u2019re unsettled. Yes, I feel that by bringing something else into the pain when I\u2019m not here, it makes it less about you and more about me \u2013 and I don\u2019t like that, I guess.  (pause) Like it means that, at least in those times, there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">is something else that can carry me that isn\u2019t you; and so it\u2019s like inferior or it\u2019s not as distancing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Also, maybe I\u2019m afraid that you will think that it\u2019s okay now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Allison\u2019s got Peg. It\u2019s okay. Peg is taking care of her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, like maybe you won\u2019t wonder as much or worry as much, which is very, very bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Sure. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s probably what made it hard to either talk about how hard it was or talk about Peg, like I started to talk about how hard it was, and then I could only do one or the other. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: At least in that moment, it felt like that . I think I did talk a little about how hard it was by talking about Peg.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll see you on Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
