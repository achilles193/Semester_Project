But because of my case, I can\u2019t do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that one of the ones that has the fingerprint recognition?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I can pop it up. It\u2019s not really that easy. As soon as I start doing that to deter my son. He\u2019s always looking over my shoulder. I had to change my password, \u2018cause he \u2013 Oh, my lord. So I\u2019m doing pretty good. A lot of shit happening. Very busy. Overwhelmed at times. But last \u2013 was it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">Tuesday where I was going to see Marcia and we were going to talk. And, you know, I went over there and I got the \u2013 there was some more conversations. And, you know, she seemed very mad. I couldn\u2019t understand why. I mean, this is consistent, but why is she mad, you know. And so I went over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">We decided to go \u2013 or, she came to Andover. I don\u2019t remember what I had said, but I think that\u2019s when I realized it started to sink into her kind of what was going on. And so we hung out for a little bit. [1:57] We went to eat. We weren\u2019t that hungry, but it\u2019s a little Tapas place and it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">overpriced, but small dishes. So we start to talk, and she was under the impression that all the things I had said in that text had happened on Sunday, where I was referencing the series of events. And once again, this seems to be more consistent, is that there\u2019s a miscommunication, and she gets mad, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">and I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s mad. But once I had said that, the wheels were turning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I kind of didn\u2019t know what to say, and we just kind of dropped it at that, and really haven\u2019t talked about it since. [2:55] And everything\u2019s been fine. And, interestingly enough, we have the offers in on the house, the condo. Looking at my NH taxes. Jess has no money. We owe about $2,000. So we\u2019re trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to get in touch with this guy, Jerry. Hey, Jerry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: This is the one you were sort of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: We had an agreement with back in 2012. And I don\u2019t know where we were in the process when I spoke with you, but he starts acting like he\u2019s wanted this thing. He sent me an e-mail back in November, is it still for sale. You know, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s still a short sale, but I\u2019m interested. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">I\u2019m interested, you know, in a short sale. So, you know, his mom was actually \u2013 there was something going on with the unit when Patricia was taking people through. I said oh, it\u2019s already under agreement. That\u2019s weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">You know, if you kind of read the agreement, you know, it kind of gives the buyer the right to back out. [4:15] I\u2019ve got to do it subject to the approval. And I really didn\u2019t even talk to Jess or Claire about \u2013 I didn\u2019t even remember what happened. Now I do, a little bit. (inaudible at 4:21) and I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">care, because Chase was not going to accept this agreement, and we told him. You know, -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Chester was not going to accept the agreement with Jerry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. Backing up, though. Jerry, you know, you\u2019ve got to let us know what you want to do. And he comes back with a very stern, you know, I have an agreement. I\u2019m forcing my rights under the agreement original, you know. I\u2019m ready, willing and able which is case law language to buy. And Patricia <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">responds, Jerry, I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding here. You know, your offer is not going to be acceptable to Chase. It\u2019s going to be rejected. The price is $259. You know, they\u2019ll take 80 percent of value. That may or may not be in there, but I was kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t think they would take it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562384\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: His offer was lower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: We listed it at $269, and we got two offers at $275 and one at $281.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019m just signing the deed and walking away. I\u2019m going to cry a little bit and then jump for joy. So we\u2019re basically saying to Jerry, Jerry listen, make us an offer that will be acceptable to Chase. And that was my intent. He puts in an offer. Well, what happens between <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">Claire and Patricia. You know, Claire technically would be entitled, under the listing agreement, would be entitled to the commission and she was just backing off and letting it go. [6:17] And so Patricia sends that e-mail, you know. Maybe she\u2019ll give us something Chase will approve. And he comes back <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">with an e-mail, multiple paragraphs, which was clearly written by a lawyer, but signed by him. You know, cease and desist. Tortious interference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">Miss Manuel, you know, Patricia, you know. And I\u2019m like, what the fuck is up with this guy? I\u2019m like, you know, this guy\u2019s shooting first and asking questions later. And his brother-in-law\u2019s a big shot lawyer. His sister\u2019s a pain in the ass. His mom\u2019s clearly a pain in the ass and he\u2019s a pain in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">ass. And I remember them giving me a very hard time about how this agreement was to be written, and I just caved, because I didn\u2019t care. And part of the agreement is an approval from the lender and then I have to approve the approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">I mean, I\u2019ve got to be reasonable, but like, they say, Cameron, bring $5,000 to closing. Uh uh. You know, foreclose. Take it. And so let\u2019s say, you know, because we put it up at $259, chase would probably counter. [7:35] And we\u2019d say okay, Jerry. But after reading that e-mail, I\u2019m like, fuck Jerry. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">You know. I called my buddy, Phil and said, Phil, you know, first of all I need you to do a short sale for me, but you know, don\u2019t worry. But we\u2019ve got a little issue going on. And, you know, I\u2019m forwarding all this stuff to Phil, and I \u2013 Tom had a couple more responses or whatever. And then, he kept <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">calling her Ms. Manuel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">So late in the day, with Patricia, Claire, Jess, Jerry, the owner of Patricia\u2019s company. You know, whatever. I replied, you can call her Patricia. You know, let\u2019s not be so formal. I\u2019m trying to say like, say, come on, dude. Just get on the phone with Patricia and talk. Let\u2019s come up with something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">So what happens Friday? Was it Friday? And I passed \u2013 I forwarded Phil\u2019s information to her. He said he\u2019s looking for counsel. So it was yesterday, yeah. We get this letter from a litigation attorney. Once again, shooting first and asking questions later. We\u2019re going to go in, get a lis pendens. We\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">going to hold up the, you know, whatever. Force our rights under the agreement. [9:04] Clients are acting in bad faith. We want to see paperwork that they submitted this to Chase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">So I called Jess, and it sounds like Phil wanted to know Jess submitted the offer to Chase. And so I called Jess up and she\u2019s like, I don\u2019t think I submitted the offer. I remember sending two packages. And it started coming back to her. She\u2019s like, actually, I called and I submitted a package. I called. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">It\u2019s in underwriting. I would call. It\u2019s in underwriting. I call it\u2019s in underwriting. And then they\u2019re like, the listing agreement\u2019s expired. Okay. New package. New listing agreement. It\u2019s in underwriting. It\u2019s underwriting. Underwriting. Finally, it\u2019s closed. That\u2019s what she says to me. And I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">well, can you call Chase -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562384\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: What does that mean, when they say it\u2019s closed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: The file\u2019s closed. It\u2019s not approved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not approved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. She doesn\u2019t understand sort of, the lingo. I was like, can you call Chase and have them put that in writing for us? She was like, ehh. I was like, okay, whatever. And I ended up going to Phil. Phil calls us all in the office. This guy wants to see<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Phil called Jerry\u2019s lawyer. [10:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, and basically, Phil is like, Cameron Swisher is the most laidback conveyance attorney I\u2019ve ever met. And your guy has him shit livid. And I\u2019m there like, cracking up. But I\u2019m pissed. And so, you know, we said listen, we told you yesterday \u2013 \u2018cause one of the e-mails back and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">forth with Jerry was okay, we\u2019ll put your offer through with Chase. And the response was, boom. Shooting again, this letter. And I\u2019m like, I\u2019m done with Jerry. So they had their conversation. They want \u2013 So I called Jess to make sure that she\u2019s applied with his offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">And Phil\u2019s at least conveyed to this guy, we\u2019re putting through his application, and my clients were not acting in bad faith. They put in applications with Chase and they closed the file. [11:26] Like, we can give proof of it. And Phil said, Cameron, get it approved now, because if they file for lis <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">pendens, having shown proof, then we\u2019ve got an argument for fees. And in fact, there were several things that I made clear. And Phil didn\u2019t convey them in the way I wanted to, but I wanted them to understand that \u2013 this isn\u2019t true, but the lender pays Dan\u2019s fee. And I will only approve a short sale <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">approval that has the lender paying all of Phil\u2019s fee, and that includes litigation expenses. So you want to go ahead and do a lis pendens and get \u2013 you\u2019re definitely not getting approval, you know. That\u2019s the first thing. \u2018Cause I could say, well, I won\u2019t be on the hook for the rest of his legal fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">And the other thing was \u2013 oh, yeah. When this thing gets rejected, no matter what, Jerry\u2019s done. This is his bite at the apple. He\u2019s done. Cameron is not going to work with him. And I don\u2019t really think Phil conveyed either of those as forcefully. Patricia even said to me, she\u2019s like, I would never <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">fuck with you. I\u2019m like, am I really that \u2013 So I called Jess. Well, I don\u2019t want to call Chase. If I\u2019m on the phone with Chase, can you look for these faxes and just put on my phone an eFax app, sent it from 2012. It\u2019s amazing. I just forwarded the fax that she sent to them, and they printed it off <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">and sent her the letter that it\u2019s not been approved. And the reason was, the condo was in litigation. And who was in the condo in litigation against? Jess and I, for condo fees which we had dismissed, so we could continue on with the short sale process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: So what happened after we got this -?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562384\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Didn\u2019t matter, right?

I\u2019m not letting Jess talk to anybody, because she will fuck it up. So if we go into court, we\u2019re screwed. So, you know, and yesterday it\u2019s like, I went to the acupuncturist and the chiropractor and it turns out I\u2019m actually going to do acupuncture first and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">then work out some \u2013 Oh, but what happened on Sunday night. I found out that I\u2019m not the captain for spring league. And I\u2019m usually like, jonesing for captain. And I now think there\u2019s a conspiracy among the kid who\u2019s director of league operations, to just turn me away at all, you know. And I can\u2019t see <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">any other reason why. [14:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">I sent an e-mail to the spring league commissioner. Why am I not captain? I texted Marcia and, you know, and I\u2019m texting Pierre who\u2019s president of the company. I\u2019m like, this is bullshit. He\u2019s like \u2013 he says to me, why are you being so sensitive. I said, oh, not again. And I\u2019m like, this is not being <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">sensitive. It\u2019s like, looking at my schedule now, I said, the company\u2019s the biggest circus and that employee the biggest clown. And Pierre goes, well, that leaves me as the ring master. I said, you said it, not me. You know, he\u2019s telling me that the younger kids are phasing out the fun, old people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">I said, yeah. They probably didn\u2019t make me caption, \u2018cause I\u2019m one of the only people that forces his players to throw hoops afterwards. Of course, I put a lot of pressure on them. And I can\u2019t think that people gave me a bad captain rating, because I missed most of last, you know. And if that was the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200493\">reason, why wouldn\u2019t they tell me? [15:40] But I looked at my schedule. I think the first game would be tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the difference if you\u2019re captain or not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: For me, it\u2019s that I feel like the decision of whether I go there or not. You know, it\u2019s easier to bail on something. If you\u2019re not captain, the captain doesn\u2019t have to be there. For instance, soccer \u2013 is the first game \u2013 soccer board meeting. If I was captain, I would go to handball, and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">the soccer board. Well, as a player, I\u2019m going to the soccer board meeting. And I haven\u2019t done any exercise, and it turns out (inaudible at 16:17) It was like one serious \u2013 well, there was two, the board meeting in May. That\u2019s where they elect new board members. I\u2019ve got to go to that. And then, Warren <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">Haynes is playing with the Boston Symphony, and that\u2019s on Wednesday. But I could make everything else if I was captain. And there\u2019s another captain. But with me being a player, I could make three of the seven games. So I e-mailed the guy again, and I said, you know, just take me off the league. Send <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D3\">me my money back. Get someone on the waitlist who can play on Wednesday. Never heard back from him. That was Sunday. Then, I finally hear from my captain. I said listen, you know, you guys got to get someone from the commission or I\u2019m not playing. (inaudible at 17:06) So, I was upset, you know. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: How many years have you played in that league? [17:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Going on close to 20.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Wow. How long have you been captain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Last fall was my first time. People were giving me shit about it. And, you know, I\u2019m always complaining about my captains, and Tommy Feld\u2019s like, you know, us volunteers, blah, blah, blah. So, you know, I felt like, okay, I can volunteer. I\u2019ll be the captain. Everything I do gets shot down. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">The insurance \u2013 you know, the waiver thing gets shot down. The Web site gets shot down. It\u2019s like, every time I try to do something for this organization, it gets shot down. And so, you know, I can\u2019t really explain to Marcia how it was more than just not being made captain, you know. Really, it\u2019s a job, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562384\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">But, you know, so yesterday was kind of crappy. I was upset. I was just in a \u2013 I distracted myself with work Sunday night. [18:25] But I did kind of \u2013 it took me a while to get started, but I went to the acupuncturist and, you know, she\u2019s sitting there telling me, after going through all my ailments, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">which is, I circled everything on the sheet, that in Chinese medicine I\u2019m hot and damp. And that the hotness can be treated by acupuncture, but the dampness really can\u2019t. And that is lifestyle. That you\u2019ve got to change your diet. Stop drinking. I\u2019m like, Jesus fucking Christ.

You know, you would think over evolution. I mean \u2013 So then I\u2019ve got an appointment with the financial planner. And for me it was more of a networking thing to see him. [19:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I think like, hard alcohol and fried foods have only been around for a very short percentage of our evolutionary timestamp.

So I start out by saying hey, you know, my estate planning business is booming. He\u2019s like oh, I forgot you did estate planning. I\u2019m just like \u2013 But this is what you\u2019ve got to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">\u2013 this is what I\u2019m (inaudible due to simultaneous dialogue 20:01) You know, but I said to him, money has started coming in and I just want to know how to handle it. What am I going to do with this cash flow? So he made me write down all my debts. I was like God, you know, I wish I could put Dr. Avi <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">in here, but he won\u2019t give me an invoice. But, you know, I put the hospital and the Faculty Medical Physicians Group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll get you one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: I put them all in there. [20:31] If I put them from smallest to largest and started paying them off, boom, boom, boom, boom. He goes, your GAP card you owe $100. Pay it off today. Money starts coming in, you know, go ahead and pay the $800 bill to the \u2013 Psychologically, it\u2019s going to feel better. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">You\u2019re going to feel like you\u2019re making some progress. He\u2019s like, and you keep doing that, and you\u2019re going to find that it may take a couple of years, but it may take a lot shorter than that. Then I\u2019ll be in a good position with all this debt gone. It\u2019s not a super amount, but it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200672\">(inaudible at 21:14) You know, collections, but, you know, hospital and what not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">So he\u2019s right, and he gave me a book to read, which I put on my phone and I haven\u2019t read. I was being lectured to the whole time. I just \u2013 and you know, it\u2019s \u2013 I \u2018m out of the office, and I had a closing on Friday that the seller just fucked up and didn\u2019t get her stuff out and give me a license. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">know, for some reason, I wasn\u2019t seeing my phone calls. I didn\u2019t realize that the guy called me and said it was okay to go on record. So everything became like a rush. I\u2019ve got all these people I\u2019ve got to call back, but I\u2019ve got to get the kids. And it\u2019s like, I shut off at 1:00 or whenever. Went and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200692\">got the kids. But I\u2019m seeing all these people who are trying to get in touch with me. [22:03] So I\u2019m worried a bunch of problems and what and new clients, old clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562384\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">So I was feeling just kind of stressed out by just not having the ability to do personal things, and still trying to get work done since like, I can\u2019t call people except for business hours. I can\u2019t make these appointments. You know, I\u2019m going to the dentist tomorrow. You know, I\u2019ve got court tomorrow. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">I\u2019ve got a case and I still haven\u2019t talked to the other lawyer about settlement, you know. And I don\u2019t want to call him, because I\u2019ve got to look through some stuff which I haven\u2019t done yet. And I did get a $3,300 bill out to a client. So he\u2019ll pay it and then I\u2019ll be able to pay the NH taxes. As soon <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B2\">as it comes in, boom, it goes out, you know. But I felt a little about that. But it\u2019s just, you know, it was crappy and so, you know, I finally get down to Marcia\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">I went back to \u2013 what did I do after Phil\u2019s. Oh yeah, I went and got the kids and then we went to hockey tryouts, which I was nervous about. [23:22] All the kids had played before, pretty much, and were zooming along and doing really well. And Ian looked like a kid who\u2019s been playing for three months. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D1\">And there was one point where he was being distracted by this kid outside the rink, and I was about to say something, and I didn\u2019t. Next thing you know, Ian just starts taking off by himself without the whistle being blown, and he comes back, and he\u2019s crying. And I\u2019m like, okay buddy, don\u2019t worry about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D2\">it. Just skate hard. Everybody makes mistakes, but don\u2019t worry about it. And he kind of stopped crying quicker than he usually does. And the thing was to skate up to the blue line, come back to the other blue line, and then skating backwards and then go forward again. [24:05] And so the first time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D3\">he skated kind of slow up to it. I knew he knew he had to stop. So he didn\u2019t, but he skated good going backwards, and then skated really hard going to the goal stand. And then coming back the other way, he even skated hard going to the line the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">And so yeah, you know, did he have the skills? No. And you\u2019ve got people all around the rink with clipboards, you know. And he\u2019s older than all these other kids. He\u2019s huge. They\u2019re tiny, but they\u2019ve played before. Some of them probably have been playing since they were three or four. And all the parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F1\">are hockey dads and hockey moms. I\u2019m so out of place. But he comes out and, you know, I was truly proud of him and I told him. He\u2019s like oh, that was so much pressure. But he enjoyed it. He\u2019s going back tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">Coach Roger told said he\u2019s probably going to move him up, because he\u2019s too big. But it was a situation where I thought Jess might have had too much effect on him, but he really was not intimidated. [25:23] He overcame mistakes and things like that, and looked back on it positively. So that was good. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">Jess\u2019 moving him back to the Healy (ph). He says to me, I\u2019m going back to the Healy, and I\u2019m like, why. He said, I have friends there. And I said, don\u2019t you have friends at (inaudible at 25:41)?

And I\u2019m like, aren\u2019t you going to miss Mr. Sanders? He\u2019s like, yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing the song. I go yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200751\">but if the only decision was to do junior chorus. All you wanted, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s like, yeah. Of course. I went, now you can\u2019t do junior chorus with Mr. Sanders, because you\u2019re \u2013 And he was like, yeah. And I\u2019m like, and, you\u2019re all the way across \u2013 To me, it shows number one, how Jess can\u2019t stick to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200752\">a position, you know. And she\u2019s been driving me crazy with this fucking crying on the phone. [26:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">Even when we get the approval with the decline, she\u2019s on the phone crying like, this is blah, blah. I was like, what kind of fucking lawyer are you? She just \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with criminals, she knows nothing about it. She can\u2019t read a contract. And I\u2019m also thinking. I\u2019m like what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200771\">are you teaching this kid. There\u2019s a vice principal who yells at people, so you want to change schools?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that the reason?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">CLIENT: That and some other things that I had no idea about. You know, it\u2019s like, literally a walk to school and now you\u2019re going back \u2013 and that affects me, too. I\u2019ve had no say, and I\u2019m going to talk with her now about trying to get a separation agreement. And I\u2019ve got to focus now on \u2013 it\u2019s pointless, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B1\">but it\u2019s going to take up time. [27:20] She\u2019s got an appointment at 11:30. But anyways, last night when I get up there and I\u2019m telling Marcia about all this stuff, she goes, she didn\u2019t say that sucks, but she said something similar. And she responded, you know. So I really think that \u2013 the discussion <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B2\">wasn\u2019t \u2013 I think this probably went back and reread the message and understood it. But she totally changed, which for me was like, left me feeling better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s terrific.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">CLIENT: And today, I\u2019m like, printing out my titles. I\u2019m like, this is Strafford County and they want it today. I mean, today. They\u2019ll get it Monday or Tuesday. Like fuck, I\u2019ve got to call these people back. I was going to go to Andover. I\u2019m like, ah. So I\u2019m going to switch everything up now and prioritize <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">this and just do what I can. [28:29] I e-mailed a bunch of people and let some people I\u2019m going to get in touch with them. And, you know, I can go to Pembroke first. I\u2019ve still got to do the title. Actually, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do that. But I could just go to Strafford, do the title at Strafford <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F2\">and then bring the copies which may be quicker. But today I\u2019m just like, no big deal. No anxiety. No worries. I had some anxiety yesterday about today and tomorrow, and not being able to get in touch with people. I think I\u2019m just kind of settling into the kind of pattern of how this all happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">THERAPIST: The rhythm of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: Triage. You know, call the guy who wants to do the condo conversation over the tenant who\u2019s got problem with the landlord. And I think I might have been more expensive than the other lawyer he talked to, so he\u2019ll probably go with them. But he\u2019s been really \u2013 Well, you really know your stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200831\">So we\u2019ll see. [29:41] So I think I\u2019m kind of grasping it better. I just feel a little disappointed in myself when I can\u2019t get back. Someone was referred to me by the people down the hall, the property manager down the hall. And he called me yesterday at noon, and I didn\u2019t even realize this until like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200832\">6:00 at night, you know. Where was I all day? My God, when am I going to call him? I\u2019ll call him on the way to Strafford. I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562384\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">And I wish \u2013 You know, I\u2019ve dealt with another lawyer at this attorney\u2019s firm, and I don\u2019t have his e-mail address. So I think I\u2019m going to send him a fax from my phone saying hey, I\u2019m getting in touch with you later today. I just \u2013 I\u2019m really tied up. It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s just like I\u2019m \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200851\">it was a 180, because it wasn\u2019t horrible yesterday. But I\u2019m rolling with it better. I\u2019m managing it a little better. [30:52] I was very stressed out about trying to get this thing on record. You know, efiling. And for some reason the done and save button or whatever, are clouded out, grayed out. I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200852\">touch them. And our Explorer doesn\u2019t work or whatever. So I\u2019m like, fuck. I go back and put it all through again, and it works. But I had wasted so much time. You know, first it was getting the printer and the scanner. And it just \u2013 you know, finally, I just, you know, got the scanner to work through <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200853\">Adobe instead of trying to do it through the Web site and just uploaded files.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">But what probably should have been in there. And I was worried, because it\u2019s Andover. I\u2019m like, how big is the line, you know. [31:38] And finally, at like, 3:12 I\u2019ve been working on this for a half hour. Ian is doing his homework. Lucille\u2019s got the phone. And finally, I get it on, and, you know, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200871\">got on relatively quickly. There were ten people ahead of me, but I went on before them, so there were probably some issues with those other ones. But I was stressed out. Marcia had already said she\u2019s doing laundry and, you know, last night I was, I really want to go down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">I\u2019m not going to do work. But I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019ve got to do work tonight. I was just exhausted yesterday. Took the kids to the Globetrotters. You know, Marcia was supposed to go, but, you know, the Patriot client of hers, they moved the key and didn\u2019t tell her. So she \u2013 I was disappointed, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">I was going to, you know, we had the opportunity. [32:42] My dad\u2019s coming to town<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: When\u2019s he coming?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: Friday. So I\u2019ll have more time with the kids, and she\u2019s going to come out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Does she know your dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 32:54). She doesn\u2019t know my mom. And the financial planner was chastising me as to how I was spending money. And, you know, I\u2019m kind of redoing my office. And he was kind of wavering on that. So I started joking with Marcia. I\u2019m like, the financial planner said to stop spending <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">money on you. And then she kind of took the wrong way. I was like, no, no. I had spent money on the Patriots tickets or the Red Sox. I\u2019m trying to give examples of other things he doesn\u2019t want me to spend money on. And she\u2019s associating \u2013 She\u2019s like, I don\u2019t have to go to Patriots games. And I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200912\">no.

I guess that is something that comes up that\u2019s difficult between the two of you. It\u2019s like, when you\u2019re actually giving each other shit and when you\u2019re kidding around and it gets a little blurry. IN other words, she thought you were continuing to give her shit, right? But you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200931\">weren\u2019t. You were actually trying to back off. [34:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">CLIENT: Right. You know, she\u2019s watching Housewives, so she\u2019s extra distracted or whatever stupid show was on TV. I am like, exhausted. I\u2019m just like, can\u2019t even keep my eyes open on the couch. So maybe I\u2019m just recognizing these moments a little better. And not, instead of like when I see her getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200951\">mad, not getting defensive or, you know. [35:05] I was really anxious and I was worried that I had trouble talking to her once I realized how she confused everything.

I had said it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">THERAPIST: What I guess there seems to be \u2013 I wonder what it was.

I\u2019m really overwhelmed. And it\u2019s like that $3,300 bill. I mean, I hadn\u2019t billed the guy since August. You know, that\u2019s money I could have had a while ago. I still feel like there\u2019s a bunch <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A11\">of people I\u2019m owed money for stuff and it will be coming in at some point. [36:47] But I\u2019ve got a couple of really pressing things that I\u2019ve got to deal with.

And like, it seems in both instances maybe you\u2019re kind of anxious about any other person <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A31\">giving you what they should be. [37:29] Colleen being able to say it and then having her sort of take it in and do whatever with it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">CLIENT: I do need to cut back both eating, spending and start exercising. I think she missed the point about spending a lot of money that I wouldn\u2019t be spending. I\u2019ve just got to pare that back. [38:22] \u2018Cause she doesn\u2019t mind making dinner. And I think she feels guilty about not having money and stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A51\">like that. I even said stop spending money on the kids. I paid $50 down payment for the league last night. I didn\u2019t even know there were hockey drives. No one tells me anything about stuff that\u2019s going on. Ian\u2019s chorus has performance, and the woman who owns the (inaudible at 39:01) the networking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A52\">She\u2019s coming into town specifically to train us. And the training\u2019s from 6:00 to 10:00 or 6:00 to 9:00, right in the middle of Ian\u2019s concert. And I\u2019ve got to go to this training. (pause) [38:29] Well, there goes dad here again. They call it the father of the year. (pause) Saturday I was in an eight <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A53\">hour course getting my F license for soccer coaching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">Kids came right over and I fell asleep on the couch. Then I got up and it\u2019s raining. Can\u2019t really do anything. And Ian wants to leave for \u2013 His Cub Scout troop was doing the color guard to bring out the flags at the Globetrotters. So he kept wanting to leave (inaudible at 40:25). So I\u2019m like, mommy\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A71\">not going to be here until 11:00 and then she doesn\u2019t come. I\u2019ve just been going nonstop. [40:40] I think maybe spring league, bailing on that has taken a little bit of pressure off. But I really wanted to be the captain. I haven\u2019t done anything to get in shape, except maybe going up stairs. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562384\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Have you been able to see the trainer at all, or are you just too busy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m busy. It\u2019s \u2013 I think once my handball schedule settles in, I can maybe find a time to do it maybe later on Wednesdays, after. The problem is getting through Concord. So anything in the late afternoon or rush hour just prolongs. The town\u2019s like a mile away. It\u2019s lumped with Pembroke. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB1\">can spit, but it takes three days to get there. [41:54] But I feel right now it would be a waste of money, because after two seconds, I\u2019d be done. So I\u2019ve got to start doing it on my own. Every day I\u2019ve wanted to do it and every day for some reason it doesn\u2019t happen. And I went like, three days in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB2\">row where I didn\u2019t even eat until dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD\">It\u2019s \u2018cause I\u2019ve been busy. I didn\u2019t even think about it. Hey, yesterday I ate nothing until \u2013 I have food and I forget about it. But then as soon as I have dinner, I keep eating. I was pretty good last night. Well, I had some chocolate chip cookies. [42:39] But I\u2019ve definitely got to cut back on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD1\">cranberry. Too much sugar. The chiropractor said that tonic water was a good substitute. I said yeah, that\u2019s funny, I used to drink vodka tonics when I was healthy. (pause) So yeah, I\u2019m going to make a list of my debts, and if you want to be on that list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll send you an invoice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B1\">CLIENT: Okay, send me an invoice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I will send you one this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B5\">CLIENT: There are probably some debts that will get paid off before you, but there\u2019s definitely some that won\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B7\">THERAPIST: All right.
