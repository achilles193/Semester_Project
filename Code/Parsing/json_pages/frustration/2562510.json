I took a personal day today from work because it\u2019s been a really long week. I went to the doctor and she said I\u2019m not pregnant. She said sometimes this happens and I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. She was asking me questions about medications and if I\u2019ve traveled and whatever. She didn\u2019t seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">particularly concerned and was like, \u201cIf you still think you\u2019re pregnant in two weeks you can take another pregnancy test.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, really? (sniggers) Thanks for the news flash.\u201d She thinks that this was a fluke or something or maybe even though I\u2019ve been taking the same birth control for a while <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">now, that it\u2019s screwing it up.  She doesn\u2019t think it has anything to do with the Celexa. If I miss my period again next month, we\u2019ll just get on a different birth control. I was really frustrated at the whole situation because I was like no. I just wanted her to do something. She was like, \u201cNo, well.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">And I was like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not normal for me. Maybe it\u2019s normal for you because you\u2019re a doctor and you see all this shit all the time, but it\u2019s not for me.\u201d And she was like, \u201cOh, I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but you\u2019re fine.\u201d Great. So whatever. And she was like, \u201cWell you\u2019re just not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">to get your period this month.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d She said, \u201cJust keep taking them.\u201d And I said, \u201cI am. And I\u2019m just trying not to worry about it.\u201d But now I\u2019m just going to be worried all over again next month and be thinking about it.  So it\u2019s been a frustrating week, and then on top of that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D5\">the late class stuff. It\u2019s starting to feel like I should drop the class. I called the extension school and asked them about how many withdraws an I have and not have it affect my grade, and she was looking at my stuff and was like, \u201cWait. Are you applying this semester to the Master\u2019s program?\u201d I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D6\">like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. I was just kind of seeing. I haven\u2019t taken a class in a while.\u201d There is this pro seminar I took and I guess I didn\u2019t even realize how long ago it was, but she said that it only lasts for two years.  And I\u2019m not about to take it again because it\u2019s really, really challenging <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D7\">for me. I don\u2019t know if you remember. It was that literature course; it was medieval literature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I remember a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I ended up writing the final paper on Jewish and whatever something, like the Jews, how they are. Anyway, it was really challenging and I did really well and it\u2019s like the main required course as part of the application process. The application process for the Master\u2019s program involves three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">courses, one, which is a [required core] seminar (ph?) and you\u2019re to get an average of a B in all three courses; and then you do the application, which includes filling out the application, $100, and two short essays and transcripts and stuff. So she basically said, \u201cWell, your kind of past it, so let\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">get your application in as soon as possible for the semester and my mom has to petition with the dean. (sighs)  So then that sent me spiraling yesterday when I found that out. I was like are you fucking kidding me? And then I started blaming it all on [Franklin] (ph?) and then all on myself because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">I didn\u2019t even remember when I took that course. I just feel like the last two years have been a waste of life and a blur and like I don\u2019t even know what I was doing. I decided to take a personal day so that I could get some of this stuff done and try to get the application done. I put in a request for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">my transcript and I actually am going on Tuesday anyway for another class, so I\u2019ll just pick it up in person there. So now I feel like I have a lot of stuff to do for that. In conclusion, I don\u2019t want to drop the class and the TA was really supportive and helpful via e-mail with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20010-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20010-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20013\">I don\u2019t think I\u2019m dropping the class, but I\u2019m really behind in work or a little bit behind in work. I\u2019m having an issue with due dates. I have an issue with due dates. I just think that they\u2019re stupid, honestly. Why not make everything due on Sunday? Just do that. Why Thursday and then Saturday and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200131\">then Sunday? I don\u2019t have time for that shit. Give it to me on Sunday. Anyway, I\u2019m complaining to the TA\u2019s and I had a TA that I thought was the right person to ask and it wasn\u2019t at all. I\u2019m not telling you the whole truth. I wrote a really immature and embarrassing, reactive e-mail to being frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200132\">by how unreasonable I felt the amount of work he was giving for one week was and that I can\u2019t do due dates because I have other shit going on, basically.  He wrote me back what I saw as a scathing e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">THERAPIST: He being . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry. The head teaching TA; and then they have the individual section leaders. She kept saying the due dates for all this stuff. I said it was too much work, but they didn\u2019t listen to me; so I was like okay, fine, I\u2019ll write him. Of course, I was trying to do exactly what I\u2019m trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">work on in this class, which is just being extremely reactive and just saying \u201cfuck you,\u201d basically; like fuck you, I\u2019m taking this course so I can do whatever I want, like I\u2019m eight or 12 or 14. I don\u2019t even understand how I\u2019m 30 and I\u2019m acting like that. So he sent me back an e-mail saying, \u201cI\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200172\">sure why you think I\u2019m the person to write to with these complaints,\u201d and I got confused. I\u2019m sorry; this was a legit question and I was upset about it. I got really confused about a reading that he assigned because next to it in parentheses he wrote \u201cRT\u201d and in previous assignments he had been writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200173\">\u201cbook\u201d or \u201ctext\u201d or something, so I just didn\u2019t connect it.  And there is like CP which is course packet and CM which is course materials and all these fucking acronyms for stupid bullshit where we find the work for this fucking class. There are so many pieces, so many videos, so many fucking readings <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200174\">and he ended up like \u201ccalm down.\u201d I don\u2019t understand why there are so many. I really don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s a little much. I think it\u2019s excessive. Anyway, so I\u2019m overwhelmed by the fact that there is tons of work that he has assigned and then there is this \u201cRT\u201d And I\u2019m like what the fuck is RT? So in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200175\">e-mail, the first question I asked was, \u201cJust to start off, my first question is where do I find the text?\u201d So his response was, \u201cIs that a serious question? If it is, perhaps a bit of self-review is in order. Fuck you. He could have just been like, \u201cThis is the required text. Are you telling me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200176\">you haven\u2019t been doing any of the readings from it so far?\u201d He could have said that.  That\u2019s what \u201cRT\u201d stood for and I didn\u2019t put it together until after he basically called me dumb. Then I felt really bad. Maybe it did, but I was overwhelmed and I didn\u2019t see it and maybe that\u2019s a little bit of learning <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200177\">disability stuff that goes on for me. When I get overwhelmed and frustrated, sometimes I just can\u2019t see. I couldn\u2019t see that that was the book . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20019\">THERAPIST: No, I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B\">CLIENT: So he was an asshole about that and was like \u201cI\u2019m not the person to talk to. I don\u2019t give a shit about your problems. Perhaps you should complain to Kevin Bailey.\u201d He was just kind of rude. And Lily, my TA, was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think you should drop out. I\u2019m here to help. Don\u2019t communicate with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B1\">[Stu] (ph?) anymore. Forward me his response because I\u2019ve been having trouble knowing how to communicate with him, so this will help me.\u201d  Everybody is via e-mail. She\u2019s in Washington State and he\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know where \u2013 for all online stuff. Cal might be here and working with Kevin Bailey in person, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B2\">but Kevin Bailey also has his TA\u2019s here for his in-person class and then the people that are taking the class at a (inaudible at 00:09:17) school have their section leaders that are in person; and those are completely different from ours and not with the extension school online course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I see. So do you go to the lectures?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m not allowed. It\u2019s not an option for extension school students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">THERAPIST: You do everything online?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">CLIENT: Everything is online. Basically, it\u2019s that ed school course recorded and we\u2019re taking it online. We\u2019re trying to also be involved and that\u2019s what all the fucking discussion posts and all this fucking bullshit is about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really have any idea what goes on in the individual sections in person. Whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter. Lily was nice and then I was like I don\u2019t know what to do about the due date situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: Did you look at a second class? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: A little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: As compared to the ed school students?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s not really bothering me that much because my section TA, Lily, is really nice. A little bit. It also feels very annoying to have to read fucking people\u2019s shit and that\u2019s how you have the discussions, as opposed to with people in person that are actually discussing it. [It felt like] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">(ph?) second class and more like this is harder for me, as an online student, than it is for the people who can actually join the discussions in person and see the lecture in person and then interact with Bailey in person. Lily is encouraging and I was even telling her I\u2019m going to see my therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">tomorrow in the e-mail.  It\u2019s very open. I have a very open communication with her because she\u2019s obviously like in psychology and learning all this stuff and into this stuff and whatever. So I said I\u2019m going to my therapist tomorrow and he has been helpful a little bit and then she was like, \u201cMaybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">there is something that we can do like that.\u201d I had mentioned your name and she was like \u201cthat Ethan could write some sort of a note at some point in regards to panic and anxiety and due dates.\u201d Then I immediately said that doesn\u2019t really sound like something that Ethan would want to do or feel comfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F4\">doing or want to get involved in, but I didn\u2019t say that to Lily. I was like \u201cSure, sure. I\u2019ll bring it up.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if it is or even relevant or necessary. To be perfectly frank, I really don\u2019t give a shit. If it affects my fucking grade, it affects my grade, like the late stuff or the due dates <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F5\">or the whatever.  I just kind of don\u2019t really care. I don\u2019t know what that means necessarily, but it makes me feel like there is less pressure on me. It makes me feel like I can actually do the work in a way that I can do better quality work, even if I\u2019m not handing things in on time.

I would imagine they have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: I remember doing it at Anaheim High. I was maybe going into freshman year or sophomore year or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: It probably would have been like a full neuro psych evaluation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Then maybe I never had that.

It\u2019s not crucial, obviously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: No, but I think I should just ask the extension, because in the other classes, I haven\u2019t really had this come up yet. I felt frustrated and stuff, but it\u2019s felt manageable and I haven\u2019t felt like I needed any kinds of accommodations and I have not wanted them necessarily because then it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">more time to procrastinate on shit. Then back to what I started saying about my dad \u2013 what if it\u2019s the class that\u2019s throwing your cycle off, just because you\u2019ve been so crazy about work and now you add this. You\u2019re stressed about your living situation. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really buy it, but this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">a more stressful class than the others that I\u2019ve taken have been. So I\u2019m happy to not have to go to work today. I\u2019ll do some work from home, but yeah, whatever.  I\u2019m hoping to get a bunch of work done today. I just feel very overwhelmed today, I guess, and that\u2019s why I was thinking about dropping the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F3\">class; but I really know I don\u2019t want to. (sighs) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">I\u2019m really struggling with the fact that I hate my roommate so much or I hate living there. What were you about to say? You had something else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: I guess you have been hit with quite a lot this week.  You\u2019re really disappointed and angry at the doctor and not exactly at the administrative person who told you that you\u2019re going to have to go through all this crap in order to make out the application, but about that whole thing; and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">in your interaction with Stu. It sounds like all that stuff really pissed you off and was really disruptive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Yes. Extremely. And also at work with all this stuff going on, like with the change in directorship and that Glenda also is leaving and that [Miriam] (ph?) is pissed.  On Tuesday I guess it was, the new director wanted to meet with us, so I had to set up the computer with the Skype to Skype <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">in the original office. We had some catering of pastries and stuff because it was after the executive committee meeting and he was already going to be there because he\u2019s part of the executive committee. It was very awkward because, first of all . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: All right. I\u2019m confused. There is an executive director and a director and Miriam and you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Right. Lots of other people. But yes, the leaders, the hierarchy goes that way, in terms of my supervisors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: The executive director and director are both leaving. They did not promote Miriam into the director\u2019s position?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Correct. Because the new director, who is the gentleman on the executive committee that wants to meet with us, decided that he needed to cast the net for the executive director after it had been proposed to Miriam by other folks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I get it. The question I have is: so there was a Skype meeting that was with the committee, but the director is local, which is why there was pastries?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: No, sorry. There was an executive committee meeting on Tuesday morning, like there is every once a month, which was local people and had nothing to do with Skype. But then Miriam came to me earlier that week and asked, \u201cCan you order some extra pastries because after executive committee meeting, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">Allen wants to meet with all of us?\u201d So the executive committee left and then it was just staff and Allen and pastries; and I had to set up the computer for Skype because we were Skyping in or original office so that those people could also meet him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: Okay. Got you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: So it was cool. I\u2019m looking forward to setting this up. Anyway, we\u2019re all sitting in there. Miriam was there and she was visibly uncomfortable. And most of the people in the room know the situation and it\u2019s tense and Alice, the current director, comes in and she had been there because of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">executive committee meeting. She introduces him and then leaves. She didn\u2019t stay for the meeting. And Miriam, who is our executive director, introduced him and then also had a meeting. So it was just staff and the new director and Miriam. It was very uncomfortable. We all went around and introduced ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: It was like a cage match between Allen and Miriam.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, literally. So then we went around and introduced ourselves and, when it was Miriam\u2019s turn to introduce herself, she was like, \u201cHi, Allen. Martini. I\u2019m the associate director of strategy and development.\u201d  That was not . . . She was kind of looking down at her phone and doing e-mail. Whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">Allen \u2013 I don\u2019t know. My people that I have spoken to, we did not get a great vibe from him. He is one of those people who kind of talks like this, like looking down almost and not necessarily engaging. I don\u2019t know. He was clearly a little bit uncomfortable, too. He was like, \u201cI want to get to know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200792\">you all, so I\u2019m going to schedule individual meetings.\u201d I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t feel a connection and we didn\u2019t feel like he had a huge connection. He kept talking about his staff.  He is a biologist or works on beetles or something, so he\u2019s over at Northwest lab, science. I don\u2019t even know where I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200793\">am. Talking about his staff over there a lot and how he has this assistant that\u2019s been with him for x amount of years \u2013 I don\u2019t know what he was trying to get to. Are you hiring her? What\u2019s going on? Are you bringing your staff over? \u201cI want you all to go over there and meet with them.\u201d I was like what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200794\">the fuck? Then people were asking some questions, trying to warm him up. Then Belinda asked about the process of hiring the executive director. I don\u2019t know if she knew what happened with Miriam, but at least half of the room was kind of like looking at her.  He wasn\u2019t looking at her and he said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200795\">he is focusing on hiring people for positions da-da-da, like kind of spewed a bunch of bullshit. He believes this person should have HR and science as top skills, and those are exactly the two things that Miriam doesn\u2019t have, in terms of actual work experience, although she obviously knows finance because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200796\">all she does is work with numbers and HR because she\u2019s been working in the same place for 12 years. She would be great at dealing with employee relations. And we also have a finance and HR person already, so it\u2019s like we don\u2019t . . . So that was uncomfortable. Then he starts to go on about how really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200797\">this person is the person that\u2019s on the ground and while I\u2019m going to be here as much as I can, this is the person that you\u2019re interacting with daily and that is your leader.  At the end of the day, the person that is selected for this position is going to make my life one way or make my life another. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200798\">Everyone chimed in almost as soon as he finished saying that and said \u201cand us, too,\u201d because it was almost as if he was saying, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t matter for you guys. It just matters for me who I choose.\u201d Then he concludes the meeting. We were talking about something and he said something towards the end <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200799\">about how he was choosing a few things that were pet peeves. One of them was replying to e-mails, to reply as quickly as possible so that it doesn\u2019t leave them open. Two, he believes in a no-dogs culture. He just doesn\u2019t believe in dogs at the office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: Right. And three, he believes in leaving your problems at home and when you\u2019re at work, you\u2019re at work. He\u2019s saying this to an almost entirely female staff, first of all, so I was joking, like \u201cis he asking us not to bleed on him once a month or something?\u201d  And he has a daughter and a wife. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">I was like, \u201cwe are not a staff who leaves their problems at home and we bring them to Miriam and close the door;\u201d and Alice understands. So we were all like \u201cwow.\u201d Also, no dogs; what the fuck? I was almost like \u201chow about cats?\u201d just to be an asshole. No dogs? What the fuck are you talking about? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">First of all, what if I had been bringing my dog here for ten years? Now you\u2019re here so I can\u2019t bring my dog anymore? No. Secondly, I should get a dog and register it as a special-needs dog, which you can do for any dog, apparently. It\u2019s really easy to get it because it can be for stress management <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D3\">\u2013 whatever. And then start bringing the fucking dog in and be like \u201cdo something about it.\u201d (both chuckle)  So that left a bad taste in our mouths for all of us. Miriam left after the meeting and went to her office to cry and a bunch of us wanted to go in there immediately after the meeting. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D4\">it\u2019s also hard for those of us that are close to Miriam to like him inherently. He hasn\u2019t come to her; he hasn\u2019t e-mailed her. He hasn\u2019t spoken to her directly at all, and it\u2019s just this big, huge elephant in the room. So that\u2019s also what made it a difficult week, just in terms of the air being really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D5\">wavy all around me, it feels like, and I just feel (sighs) . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I guess incredibly tense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes. And then now, add to it the health stuff and still kind of not knowing what\u2019s going on there. And my brother moved into his apartment this week so that\u2019s all my mother has been able to talk about and she has been really tired and stressed about that stuff.  I had an incident with my father <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">where, last week or the week before, he had asked me if I wanted to go see this version of the Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream that was playing at (inaudible at 00:27:13) because, if I remember, we went a while ago when I was younger to a version of it at the ART. I was like yeah, that sounds great. Let me <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200812\">look at the dates. Okay, here are the dates that I\u2019m available. Look at your schedule and get back to me within 24-48 hours and let me know so I can write it in. He never got back to me. Then Wednesday he calls me and says, \u201cSo, are we on for tomorrow night?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200813\">He was like, \u201cThe play.\u201d I was like, \u201cYou never called me.\u201d He was like, \u201cNo, damn it. I know.\u201d Like he knew. I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t. Fine,\u201d because I don\u2019t want to miss this opportunity because I did think it was a nice idea. Finally he\u2019s coming to me with something that I think would be fun and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200814\">I\u2019m interested in and that I remember as being a nice experience before with him \u2013 and he fucks it up.  (laughs) So then I was like, \u201cI\u2019d really rather not do that tomorrow night because I have schoolwork. I\u2019m just not prepared. What about Friday or Saturday?\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, don\u2019t you want to reserve <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200815\">this for Friday night?\u201d I was like, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have any money and I\u2019m staying home all weekend. Just let me know.\u201d So then he was looking at Saturday night. Then he called me last night and said, \u201cI spoke to Tracy and it\u2019s [Quorum] (ph?) on Saturday, so we have plans with Nathanial\u2019s\u201d who is Jesse\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200816\">best friend, \u201cfamily to have dinner with them. So Friday night or a matinee on Saturday?\u201d I was like \u201cmatinee.\u201d Fucking let\u2019s end this. Either you\u2019re doing it or you\u2019re not. That was stressful because it was like Jesus Christ, this family \u2013 They don\u2019t communicate with each other. He forgets shit. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200817\">sorry, this just all brings me back to the fact that she married somebody 20 years her senior. She went into this with the understanding that she would have to deal with this kind of stuff down the road.  He doesn\u2019t remember stuff. He\u2019s a mess. He\u2019s old. She needs to be there to make sure that he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200818\">writing things in his book and he has a book. What the fuck schedule is he even checking, that he gets all this shit fucked up? And then doesn\u2019t call me back. He said, \u201cMaybe you need to stay on top of me with these kinds of things.\u201d I was like, \u201cFine, but this is why we can\u2019t do as much because I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200819\">constantly be keeping after you to make plans or confirm. I had plans.\u201d And it just made me upset that Tracy \u2013 it made me feel like she\u2019s not taking care of him. I just think it\u2019s her job to do that. I\u2019m sorry. Maybe it\u2019s because I feel like it would be my job as a wife. I understand that adults, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008110\">a certain extent, have to be responsible for their own things and maybe this is something she has been dealing with for as long as they have been married \u2013 and she probably has \u2013 but to the same extent, help the guy out then.  You married him, Tracy. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry if this pisses you off, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008111\">then you should have fixed it years ago with him. Figure out a system that works. I just feel like she doesn\u2019t care and now it\u2019s getting worse because he\u2019s getting older and she\u2019s even more so like, \u201cOh, well, now let\u2019s just chalk it up to Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: I think actually this is a lot of what you\u2019re talking about. Nobody taking care of you and then the people who are supposed to be \u2013 the doctor and the administrator at the extension school and the people you work for and your dad \u2013 are really falling short in a major way.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: Not so much my mom. She\u2019s fine. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: I think another thing that\u2019s going on is that I imagine that with me, you\u2019re actually a bit more comfortable. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve grown more confident that I\u2019m going to fix things, but I think you are a little more confident that I\u2019ll be caring in what I say about what is going on with you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200871\">and that you can kind of expect that, if you put out there what\u2019s really upsetting you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: Yes. That\u2019s true. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I imagine that, at times, you were also anxious because you\u2019re talking about it so often and it often doesn\u2019t fucking work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s close. One of the pieces is I was up late on the whole Stephanie issue the other night because she had a breakdown about her finances and she\u2019s in debt and her Adderall addiction, so now she has asked for my help in helping her figure out what to do.  So that was adding <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D1\">to it. There was a lot this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: That is a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: It felt like a very demanding week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah. How worried are you about the . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: Not. I mean, she came clean to me that she was taking . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">THERAPIST: I thought maybe you were bringing it up because, in part, you\u2019re worried that it made you anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">CLIENT: I\u2019m checking in on her all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I see. I wasn\u2019t sure if you were asking for something from me related to that or if you were just saying that it was another stressful thing for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D\">CLIENT: Another stressful thing. She spoke to her therapist and came clean with her therapist about how much she\u2019s been using over her prescription \u2013 not everything yet, I don\u2019t think. She hadn\u2019t told her therapist, but I guess she\u2019s been taking up to 20-30 over the prescribed dosage per day and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D1\">has gotten her into this loop of not sleeping and she feels like she\u2019s racing around all the time and that she never gets anything done but she\u2019s always racing da-da-da.  I told her that I\u2019m here for her and I\u2019m here to help her, but she does need to look at this as something wrong because she\u2019s buying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D2\">on the side from friends that she knows have it. She\u2019s not snorting it or anything. She\u2019s taking it like a pill. She\u2019s got this dependency on it now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s physically addictive, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">CLIENT: Adderall? Really? I mean, I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s more like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">CLIENT: Like a mental thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like you get used to it. She feels she\u2019s not going to be as productive or like she needs the energy or she\u2019s going to be too exhausted if she sort of stops raising the amount \u2013 that kind of thing. It\u2019s not like with alcohol, where you may feel like you need it in a psychological way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A71\">but you also need it physically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">CLIENT: Right. That\u2019s good to know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I know people who have stopped and they don\u2019t have symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">CLIENT: Withdrawal. And that\u2019s what she was freaking out about having to stop it all together, like \u201cam I not going to be able to take it at all anymore?\u201d She\u2019s thinking about it as an addiction in black and white. I was like, \u201cI think that for heroin users, yes, it\u2019s very black and white; but for this <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD1\">I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as black and white and I think you need to figure out a way to either manage this as a drug to help you with your anxiety or whatever you\u2019re dealing with or talk to your doctor about maybe prescribing you an anti-anxiety or an anti-depressive. Maybe this is not the right medication <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD2\">for you. I\u2019m helping her by checking in and saying, \u201cHey, did you take your dosage? How did you feel?\u201d Blah-blah-blah. She\u2019s asked me to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking about something else, which we\u2019ve talked about before, which is \u2013 I don\u2019t get the feeling about this from the other things that you were saying, but from the content of what you just said \u2013 it makes me wonder whether you are worried about being dependent on me. This is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF1\">I thought before, that you worry that if you feel trusting or cared about, that that will make you dependent or addicted on whoever it is.  It just occurs to me that I said that and then you went right to her addiction; that\u2019s why I\u2019m wondering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t clear. I didn\u2019t necessarily have a strong feeling that that was true, but I wondered about it. I\u2019m not saying it also wasn\u2019t stressful with what happened with her. I\u2019m just saying maybe that\u2019s what you were responding to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think it was conscious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Sure. Absolutely. I didn\u2019t have the sense that it was something that you were conscious of.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562510\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B9\">CLIENT: (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You just said that\u2019s scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. A little bit, but at this point . . . I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Sure. All right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C1\">CLIENT: I guess there is a distinction between feeling like you\u2019re dependent on something and feeling like you have somebody that you can depend on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Absolutely there is a distinction. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C5\">CLIENT: I think that it\u2019s hard for me sometimes. It becomes a gray area more for me, in terms of relationships that I have, I think. (pause) I would like to have somebody that I can depend on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C9\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m dependent on somebody to feel a certain way. (pause) Last night I had a chance to catch up on some reading and do whatever. I left work early. Helen wasn\u2019t home, so that was nice. I also felt lonely, but not for her. I like having the house to myself. Also, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C91\">I started to think about the fact that I really don\u2019t have any friends that come over and I wish I did.  Nobody ever comes over to my house. I\u2019m always going over to other people\u2019s houses and I don\u2019t know why; then it makes me feel insecure. Is it because of where I live? Is it because of my neighborhood? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C92\">Is it because people think there is no parking? I don\u2019t know. Or is it because I don\u2019t invite people? But then who would I invite? Stephanie doesn\u2019t have a car, so it\u2019s easier for me to go to her house. But I wish she would still come to my house sometimes. Donna has a kid and lives in Cambridge and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C93\">is never around here and it\u2019s just . . . (pause) It was so nice to have the house to myself. Yesterday, another thing about the personal day is that it\u2019s good because I\u2019m already going to be on the couch staking my claim on the living room before she even gets home. (pause)  I may even be just doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C94\">homework on it and I\u2019m going to have to ask her to hang out in her room. I just don\u2019t give a shit. She\u2019s such a fucking slob. The other night I was at Stephanie\u2019s and at 8:30 Helen texted me, \u201cDo you have any Advil I can have?\u201d First of all \u2013 did I tell you about the Advil incident? I was missing a <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C95\">full bottle of ibuprofen that I thought was in the medicine cabinet. One morning I woke up with a headache and looked for my ibuprofen, which I know was in the fucking medicine cabinet because that\u2019s where I fucking keep my ibuprofen and it wasn\u2019t there. I said, \u201cHey, Helen. Did you borrow or take this?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C96\">I don\u2019t remember what I said. She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t take it. I wouldn\u2019t have taken it.\u201d I was like, \u201cI just wondered if you maybe used it and forgot to put it back.\u201d She was like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know, because I remember seeing it there.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s where it was. I guess it will just have <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C97\">to go unsolved \u2013 the case of the missing ibuprofen.\u201d  And then, either the next day or later that night, I\u2019m in the pantry getting some pasta and it\u2019s shoved between some bags of rice or something. I\u2019m thinking how did I miss seeing that there? Then I was like wait a second \u2013 it\u2019s not even that. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C98\">think I\u2019ve been seeing it there because I don\u2019t fucking miss things like that. I\u2019m kind of anal about my organization. Secondly, I would never, in my drunken, most blackout state, put my ibuprofen in the fucking pantry. It just would never happen. I take the fucking pills out of the bottle and put it <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C99\">back in the medicine cabinet and drink a glass of water right there. Done. It\u2019s just the way that I function. So I\u2019m like oh, my God. This is really either a lie or she forgot she had it and, instead of just coming clean with me, she shoves it in the kitchen so that I can find it later and be like \u201cwow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C910\">I must be going fucking crazy.\u201d So I left it in there for a few days and then quietly retrieved it without telling her \u201coh, look. I found the fucking thing.\u201d And I put it in my room. She texted me, obviously knowing that I had found and took the ibuprofen that she had shoved in the pantry.  And she <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C911\">had gotten an Excedrin migraine the other day because she was out of [CDS] (ph?) and I had a migraine and a hangover after this party I went to last Friday. So I didn\u2019t text her back because I was at Stephanie\u2019s. It was 8:30 and was like she can walk to the corner store. There is literally a corner <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C912\">store from our house and she\u2019s down there all the time smoking cigarettes. So I was like I\u2019m not responding to that. So I get back \u2013 Stephanie knew the ibuprofen story \u2013 and she had gone to the pantry and looked for it. (both laugh) so I didn\u2019t text her back and she stopped me, waiting outside the bathroom <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C913\">for me when I come home at 10:00, and was like \u201cso do you have any?\u201d I was like, \u201cAny what? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sure.\u201d I go into my bedroom and get four out of the bottle and handed it to her. And all I could think was in the time between what she called the worst cramps, in the time between when she texted <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C914\">me and when I actually got home, she was clearly still awake, and she couldn\u2019t just put her big girl pants on and walk to the corner store?  I\u2019m fairly certain that she was down there smoking a cigarette. It just would have been three more steps. She could have left her cigarette lit on the curb and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C915\">gone back up. That\u2019s the kind of shit \u2013 like we\u2019re not friends. This is not how this is working. I buy ibuprofen. You use all of my shit.
