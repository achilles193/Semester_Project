Did Lisa send it to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I could look it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Okay. Should I write it for January also?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s up to you if you want. (pause) I guess it\u2019s a hundred and eighty for both. It\u2019s a hundred for December and eighty for January. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Thank you. (silence from 00:02:35 to 00:04:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not really sure what to talk about. (pause) Last time we talked about my dad and his whatever. You know, sexuality. How he did certain things that my mom didn\u2019t approve of or that made her really depressed. I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand why that has like remained with me as an impression <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">or as a scathing, depressing kind of scenario to be in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I guess I don\u2019t understand what it has to do with me or why does it have to sit with me or burden me with baggage. Yeah. And why that has any bearing on my present or my future. I guess it\u2019s just like, it just sits there like he did that and that depressed my mom and that was so sad. She was sad and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">because she was sad, it made me sad. That\u2019s basically it. It\u2019s just like it\u2019s powerful enough to make me feel sad even now. I guess I\u2019m questioning that and why that still has power over me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">There are other things that do kind of affect my parent\u2019s behavior. I don\u2019t know. You know, feeling like an outsider, etc. That has more bearing on me than this does. Although maybe this, in some way, informs the decisions I make. I don\u2019t know. I mean I know I over react to certain things. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">(silence from 00:07:20 to 00:09:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I guess it does act to make a feeling of powerlessness in some way. Her inability to walk away and put an end to something that she didn\u2019t like or approve of instead of staying in that situation for so long, for years. That kind of makes me feel powerless. You can\u2019t change things if you don\u2019t like them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">You don\u2019t have a choice. Life can be so awful with this and I\u2019m measuring that only by the extent of her sadness about it. I guess that is one bearing that it has. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">It\u2019s sad. I think of that and it makes me feel powerless and like I can\u2019t do anything. (silence from 00:10:40 to 00:13:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to construct it, but it\u2019s not really happening. I don\u2019t know. (pause) I guess last time we were also talking about expecting less from people and just being more open minded. I guess that is what lead to this discussion and I\u2019m trying to find my way back to that. I don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">more to say about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess in this case, it\u2019s expecting so little from somebody. Like in your mother\u2019s case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Having such low expectations or having higher expectations and just having them be constantly unfulfilled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I guess that is. I\u2019m never sad but I\u2019m thinking why she should have just walked away much sooner instead of staying in that situation and feeling powerless for so long. Once you know that their expectations are not going to be met, then you alter them or if you cannot do without <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">them you kind of move away. You know? So you can stop expectations or at least not derive any meaning from them. At least she tried and who knows. She wouldn\u2019t have had the material or emotional pay back. The foundation completely breaks away. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562680\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">Maybe that\u2019s my fear behind building anything with anyone. (laughter) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: You mean building what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Anything with anyone. Any kind of relationship or even not just with people, but I don\u2019t know. I guess I sometimes wonder if I will be able to build anything. I feel like I have been at the same place for a long time. I\u2019m still an MA student. I mean I started doing MA\u2019s in 2004 or 2005 or 2006. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">That\u2019s been like 8 years. I don\u2019t have a PhD, but I had started one. It\u2019s just what I chose for my specific whatever purpose. I am learning more than I knew back then. That\u2019s for sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">You know, career wise I feel like I don\u2019t know if I am able to build and go from strength to strength and from experience to experience. Instead I\u2019m just like going horizontally and trying. You know, to climb the ladder, so to speak. Not just climb the ladder, but build something. It\u2019s like even with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">David I don\u2019t feel like I have succeeded in building anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well, you chose to keep getting more master\u2019s degrees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: As your perception that that\u2019s not building, but you chose to get two of the same master\u2019s degrees too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I\u2019m sure I have positive reasons and I know what they are. I just want ease and money and stuff, but I\u2019m just finishing a project. In the back of my head I feel or I fear that I have this feeling that I will still be at that same level and that I hadn\u2019t learned my lessons. So, in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">a way of like punishing as well. You know? That\u2019s what I\u2019m sure is an example of what is happening. Well, I guess that could be fine if it lasts a few years and maybe once I somehow build my confidence, I might allow myself to graduate from this MA stage. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">You know? I just hope that I am building confidence, you know. I think I am. It\u2019s just, I\u2019m just very, not very confident in the fact that I have any confidence. (laughter) So. (pause) Yeah, I mean especially with relationships and friendships I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m valued. I mean maybe break up with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">them and sort of in the end it\u2019s destroyed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ve talked about that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Feeling destructive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I know. I guess your take on that is that I was unhappy and walking out was not really a sign of being destructive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I talked to you before that I do think that some of the things you have done are destructive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: But I also know that you talk about how your parents described you. Your mother in particular in destructive in way that didn\u2019t seem like learned. Maybe there were destructive elements, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason you left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Maybe not the primary reason. I said that it seemed like what you were doing in the relationship was far more destructive then you leaving that relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: That definitely seemed destructive. (silence from 00:21:15 to 00:22:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: I guess I understand why I did those destructive things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562680\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You seem a little distracted today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m not like thinking about something else. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s hard to explain. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s been what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I have anything else on my mind. I\u2019m trying to concentrate on something that\u2019s not really solvent, doesn\u2019t really feel really solvent right now. I don\u2019t know. (silence from 00:23:00 to 00:23:45).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">I guess when I went there that was a lot of unresolved anger and jealousy and stuff that made me do destructive things. Not to say that I\u2019m not still doing those same things, but I feel like I am more conscientious. I feel like I don\u2019t want to destroy things anymore. Sometimes I feel like I do want <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">to destroy or I am being destructive, but other times I feel like I consciously feel like I don\u2019t and I want to build stuff, I guess. Like working so long on one thing, one book, is I feel like that is one sign of trying to be constructive. You know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">Maybe revisiting things and seeing the spark in them. I feel . I\u2019m trying to make time for my mom. I\u2019m trying to be there for David in whatever way. (laughter) Yeah. I\u2019m feel like I\u2019m building. Being nice to Nelson despite my fears and anxieties and things like that. I don\u2019t know if I am building <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">anything there. I just feel like at least I\u2019m not being blatantly destructive. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the harder thing to talk about. Like my feelings for David and Nelson are so still confused. Basically, I\u2019m getting two very different things from two very different people. It\u2019s just a matter of deciding <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200752\">what I can do without and who I want to build something with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">I guess I\u2019m looking at a long term relationship as like building something and I just don\u2019t know what exactly I\u2019m going to build. Whatever it is that I build with one of these guys would look very different. At least it feels like that. It feels positive and something that I\u2019m building instead of just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">like walking in to a situation and you can\u2019t do anything about it. Most of the time being with David felt like that. That I had no idea he felt like the guy my parents had chosen for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Really? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I never got that sense that it\u2019s someone that you wanted or felt conflicted about, but that you chose. I never knew that you felt that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Sometimes I have kind of a feeling like that. Like I have no choice even though I did, as you say, get out of doing those destructive things just to make myself feel like I have a choice. Maybe that\u2019s why I did them. Because that\u2019s like the counter to the feeling that I didn\u2019t have a choice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: This may seem somewhat tangential. I imagine it\u2019s related somehow. I was thinking about money and I was thinking about money in here and I know I have brought it up before. I just know that money is such a big issue for you. I\u2019m just always curious. I know I usually have to ask a few times <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">about the bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I guess I want to understand your feelings more about it because I know it has meaning for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: No. I don\u2019t quite understand the procedures. As soon as Lisa sends me the thing, I should write a check and give it to you at the session?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562680\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. I mean usually .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Or should I, am I supposed to mail it somewhere?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: No, no, no. You\u2019re supposed to give it to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Usually, when people get the statements, they pay me within a few weeks. I usually ask like at the latest by the end of the month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: So, but yeah. When she sends a statement, I mean not necessarily the next session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: You know. Usually within a couple weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know. I guess the larger feeling about money is that I\u2019m not staying on top of a lot of things that are not automatic deductibles. I have trouble staying on top of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I get the sense you\u2019re kind of putting it off a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I do put it off in the sense that, like I said, if it\u2019s not automatically deducted then it\u2019s something that I have to keep in my kind of list in my head and that list kind of gets confused or misplaced, I guess. Yeah, but I do have major anxieties about money and what the hell I\u2019m doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">and not making any right now and over spending, actually. I\u2019m borrowing from David now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">This past month it\u2019s been like I have to pay for school and my mom\u2019s rent and so I had to borrow money from David.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Do you mean school for tuition?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. That was a huge thing too. The delayed payment. It was from a year ago and Amherst is like a messed up place anyways. You ask five people and they\u2019ll give you ten different answers. So, I was under the impression I didn\u2019t have to pay anything, but apparently I do have to pay some things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">because the health insurance went up and stuff. So, yeah. I guess I was like, in the past, I have been able to take care of my finances in the sense that I have saved money. I\u2019ve paid off student loans and I have had jobs and felt like things were in control and things were agreeing. Now that I\u2019m a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A52\">student again, I don\u2019t know. I feel, yeah, like I\u2019m not on top of my finances. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: What is, I mean do you feel that you can\u2019t create some of the structure for yourself outside of school in terms of writing? Like, what is the, it just seems like from an economic standpoint you\u2019d do much better off not having to pay tuition. Even having a small, part time job and then being <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">able to write rather than going to school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just didn\u2019t have the community and I mean the structure was there. I had a job. I\u2019d come home and write. It was just a lot of things back then that were bothering me that I just felt like I couldn\u2019t do anything about. I felt very weak and powerless. I don\u2019t know. Since after Simmons, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">it\u2019s just been like crazy and a huge mess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">Simmons created some really, really unreasonable expectations. The teachers are there are so famous and they said oh, you can be like the next best thing and I thought that meant okay, success is just around the corner. So, I started expecting, very unreasonably, like okay, a vacation right away. My <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">professor said take the next couple of years off and write and I didn\u2019t even know how to do that and what the hell that meant. So, like six months after Simmons I went (inaudible) for six months. David was doing his dissertation and so I helped him with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562680\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">Those six months I wasn\u2019t very. Then, I came back and I got a job and that was like I was really, really resentful of that because he was writing his dissertation. I guess he didn\u2019t really have much money for rent or maybe he paid a little bit of the rent or helped with the rent. So, that was when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">felt like okay, yet again, I\u2019m putting my dream on hold. I am working in a full time job and paying the rent and taking care of my mom and my boyfriend which is like I just had this in my head. I shouldn\u2019t have had to think this way, but I did. While some of my other classmates, they were writing because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">they didn\u2019t have to take care of their mom or anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">They were working on their novels. Yeah. So, a year later I just kind of panicked and I was like okay, I come home and I write, but this is crap. I just keep getting rejected. So, then I went part time in that job which was also kind of a stroke of luck that they let me go part time. Even then, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">finances were okay. (laughter) Then David got a job, but instead of seeing that, I was like hey, we\u2019re building stuff. You know, like strength or power by association. Instead, I just couldn\u2019t believe he was like, I saw him as this inconsiderate assembling or whatever who took everything or made sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF2\">that he succeeded while I was still at the starting gate. So, then I just was like fuck this. I just completely panicked and left my job, I guess. It wasn\u2019t that I applied to schools or anything academic. Still, I worked. I know it\u2019s was a very long winded answer, but I\u2019m guess I\u2019m trying to understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">I feel like there was a lot of like, as you said before, a lot of reactions to planning stuff. Well, sometimes. I feel like still the motivation was all from reacting to stuff and impulsive behavior. Then, you know, you could also say that was the fire. Creative people, I feel like they need, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">how they get stuff done. They have this fire. (laughter) So, I\u2019m like maybe that was my fire. I do feel like my approach to all of this was a bit haphazard and reactionary and impulsive rather than meticulous and planned. I\u2019m like maybe I don\u2019t have the luxury. I didn\u2019t have the financial or like familial <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B12\">foundation or the emotional foundation to be that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: That makes it even more imperative that you plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Does it? (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. We all have to worry about money and other things even when we plan as much. If you have less to fall back on, you need to plan even better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a scenario that I may not have the luxury of having. I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m being defensive, but I feel like I want to be defensive right now. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I just feel. I don\u2019t know. When you said that, I thought of Nelson and I was just like I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: You thought of him in terms of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: He\u2019s someone who plans and he has money and that\u2019s because he planned and he has a new, corporate, nice job. So, if I still want to do that, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m just making excuses, but I feel like I don\u2019t know. I just feel resentful. I still do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Resentful at?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Well, just that I didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t able to plan for whatever and that I am still doing it and you know. That I feel like that I\u2019m not building and that I\u2019m just running away and destroying things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562680\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But you have the power to do something different if you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just don\u2019t know what it is that I want to build when there\u2019s very few things that would be on my list I\u2019m building. Yeah. My writing and me as a person. That\u2019s it, basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: So, you\u2019re resentful at your situation or at someone or people? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. At the situation and maybe a little at myself, but I don\u2019t know what to do about that. You know? I can\u2019t really go back and change stuff other than going back and saying I shouldn\u2019t of done that or I should of or the next time when the same thing comes around I\u2019ll react differently. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">best I can do is be kind to myself and be like you know I didn\u2019t know any better back then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: But the question is so that\u2019s important. But then another question is what about now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. What about now? I mean that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I want to identify what those right steps are that get me from this you know like feeling like this ping pong ball going not in between two players, but down steps. You know. The basement, the steps to the basement rather than like moving forward. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: But, in a sense it\u2019s almost reminds me of what you were saying about your mom earlier. That you felt sad that she didn\u2019t feel that she could actually do something about her circumstance and that she was powerless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s what I want to change. I don\u2019t want to be that way. So, yeah. I mean I just want to identify those steps to be what they are that make me feel like I am going from strength to strength and building stuff. It\u2019s not visa vie other people, because that\u2019s just too confusing. At least <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">just visa vie me and my work or what I want to do career wise. Yeah. Because I mean it\u2019s not like there is a pretty messy thing that I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s not like get a job. Stay with it and keep moving up. You know? It\u2019s not simple like that I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: No, but I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s work situation is that simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Really? Some people it is. I think it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: You think it is. I think you see, because you see yourself as sort of so outside and I appreciate that writing has probably a more amphioxus structure. That\u2019s more of a structure than other professions, but there\u2019s a way in which you imagine well, everyone has this sort of linear, clear path <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">and you just have to do this, this and this and they get to this, but I, no, I don\u2019t have any of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You think that in a lot of different ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. You think that\u2019s kind of destructive or hurtful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I do because I think it\u2019s just a very idealized view of what other people have and what other people can do and that you\u2019re an outsider and it makes you feel angry and resentful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It does. (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate even. I think your father very much felt like that. I think it\u2019s sort of very much an adoption of an absorption of the feelings that he had and I think your mother in her own way too in terms of what she\u2019s entitled to and what she feels other people do and don\u2019t have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Relative to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Probably true.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562680\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I do think it\u2019s a destructive narrative because it keeps you on the outside. It keeps you alienated from other people and it keeps you feeling very deprived. (pause) Actually think with a different narrative and you will just feel better and you will feel more empowered and you will feel less alienated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: On that note, we need to stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: I will see you on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Alright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Have a good day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Thank you.
