(sighs) That I think I have $20 or $25 in my bank account. I\u2019m still struggling with that because I have to get the couch and my parents said they would help me with the couch and then when I asked them \u201cyou said you were going to help me so I could get the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">Juris prudence out of the way, too,\u201d because that was $188, they were like, \u201cSorry, we can\u2019t help you.\u201d I\u2019d like to go to the supermarket and get cereal and toilet paper and Mucinex, but I probably won\u2019t have enough money to.  I\u2019m sick of living this way. It\u2019s so annoying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re still stretched pretty tight, huh? Because you had to furnish your apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I got a $200 couch and my parents kept telling me \u201cwe\u2019ll help you.\u201d $200 isn\u2019t that much for most people, but it\u2019s a lot for me because the Juris prudence was $200, so I can\u2019t do a couch and Juris prudence. I kind of wish now that I would have just suffered and not gotten the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: So now you\u2019ve got to wait to take Juris prudence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I get paid on Friday. That\u2019s my priority. I haven\u2019t taken it. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s going to have to be another two paychecks until I can afford the actual license because that\u2019s $275. Whatever. I\u2019m not in a rush. Maybe I should do my taxes soon so I can get some money back. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">now I have a potential new relationship with this guy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: James, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I had to tell him in my last relationship, he would see me once a month or once every two weeks and we wouldn\u2019t go out. I\u2019m not used to spending money because he likes to go out and eat and have a beer, play pool. I feel bad but I have to tell him. He was like, \u201cNo, I picked up on that. Don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">worry. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He\u2019s being really nice about it, but it just feels annoying that I can\u2019t be a regular adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What has it meant with James?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t feel any judgment. I can\u2019t find anything wrong with the guy. I keep thinking to myself every box that I\u2019ve always wanted to have checked off, he\u2019s checking them off. It\u2019s unbelievable.  He, in front of me, already made plans for Valentine\u2019s Day for a reservation. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">going to tell you where it is, but it\u2019s a little bit fancy. Dress up.\u201d He got me flowers just for the hell of it. Saturday we were supposed to get together in Amherst for him to meet some of my friends, but we both gave each other the same cold. We didn\u2019t have a fever or anything, but we just felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">resting. He was like, \u201cLet\u2019s just rest together.\u201d So we did and I went over to his place. What did we do on Saturday night? We just hung out and watched a movie, played video games, slept and slept really good and deep, talked a lot, and the next day he was like, \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d He lives over <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">by Bunker Hill.  Supposedly during the summer it\u2019s a lot prettier. He thought the snow would be cleared, but then it wasn\u2019t and it became this big joke because I\u2019m really clumsy and he basically took me on this treacherous walk. We went on this three-mile walk with both of us having colds. But the whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">time \u2013 you know how some people can just be playful? He\u2019s playful. We were making dinner together Friday night. That\u2019s what we did. He was in the kitchen and I had music on in the background and then he\u2019d start dancing and pretending like Dirty Dancing like, \u201cCome, come run to me.\u201d (chuckles) Being <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200215\">silly and playing and doing things. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever wanted and looked for and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m kind of scared of it and what I wanted to talk to you about today is why am I still so drawn to Brian? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563365\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">I was talking to my mom last night. She\u2019s all excited about this relationship. It\u2019s so sad. She keeps saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be alone anymore.\u201d (sniggers) That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. She doesn\u2019t get it, but okay. She just keeps saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m just so happy because I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">that you\u2019re not alone now.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI was doing okay. I\u2019m fine.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Such interesting terms, right? Must be some of her fears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m just struggling because I can\u2019t get Brian out of my head. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, no. Are you serious?\u201d She sounded annoyed with me. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not used to easy relationships. I\u2019m used to complicated, difficult relationships.  When I\u2019m with James it seems so easy.\u201d No effort and smooth <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">and fun. Brian is so complicated and I think he\u2019s been sensing more and more that I\u2019ve been distance. Like Superbowl Sunday I was with James all day and I didn\u2019t text him all day. He got really offended and I told you a little bit about that at the end of the session. Again this past weekend, his wife <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">had to have almost a hysterectomy and blood transfusions and all this stuff. She\u2019s having major medical problems. I stayed home Friday because I was sick and thought I would just rest. I texted him at 5:00. Brian and I were texting back and forth. He never responded back and then I again texted him <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200273\">at 8:00 like \u201chello, how are things going?\u201d Nothing.  Then again at midnight \u201cokay I\u2019m going to sleep; goodnight.\u201d Nothing. I didn\u2019t hear from him until Sunday morning, and by then I was with James so I didn\u2019t answer. He just texted me with \u201chello, good morning?\u201d Two hours later \u201cokay, I get it.\u201d It <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200274\">was like insinuating like you\u2019re busy and I know you\u2019re probably on a date. I feel like saying, \u201cWhat do you expect me to do, just sit around and wait?\u201d I feel like that\u2019s what he wants me to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">I think he\u2019s getting desperate and just saying things to toy with my head to keep me around because the other day, James was coming over for the snowstorm. He wanted to get snowed in with me.  This was on Wednesday night when the storm was. He was going to come over late that night after work and Brian <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">texted me when I was at home, like 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening, and he was like, \u201cI have your snow shovel. Do you want it?\u201d I was like, \u201cThe snow shovel that I asked you for before Christmas, like two snowstorms ago? That snow shovel?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve had it in storage. I just didn\u2019t get a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">chance, but now you\u2019ll need it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, well I could have used it two months ago, but sure, bring it over.\u201d It wasn\u2019t even that easy. He kept texting me like, \u201cI\u2019m about to turn the corner to your house and go to Hamden.\u201d I asked him why he was going to Hamden and he made an insinuation like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">\u201cWell, you\u2019re busy tonight so I\u2019m making other arrangements,\u201d as in I\u2019m going to go sleep with someone else. That got me so desperate to keep him. When he was like, \u201cI\u2019m about to turn near your house. Do you want the shovel or not?\u201d  I was texting him \u201cYes, yes. Come over. He told me to come downstairs <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200294\">to his car and I got the shovel and I sat in the passenger seat and I thought that might lead to a conversation, like him telling me, \u201cHey, Melanie. I know you\u2019re dating someone and it seems to be getting serious. I sense some distance between us. I\u2019m hurting.\u201d Like communicate. He just sat there in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200295\">silence. We did not say very much. I kind of left it open-ended like, \u201cSo, are we going to talk? Are you going to say anything?\u201d Nothing. Then what was funny is he didn\u2019t come upstairs. He even said something to me like, \u201cI know that you want me to come upstairs right now, but I\u2019m not going to let you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200296\">so I\u2019m going to go home now.\u201d Like exerting his power. Like I know you want me right now, but I\u2019m not going to give myself to you.  He went home and that was that. The next day when somehow between me and Brian it came up that this guy might be in the picture, Brian said something to me like, \u201cI thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200297\">we talked yesterday and got an understanding of what was going on.\u201d (chuckles) I was just like \u201cWhat? You must think I\u2019m psychic or something that I\u2019m reading your mind because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going through your mind.\u201d He was saying some things like, \u201cMelanie, but I\u2019ve made arrangements; like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200298\">in the process of possibly getting a condo.\u201d \u201cWhat? You made arrangements? Who are you talking to?\u201d He was like, \u201cYou know this. I\u2019ve told you this and I\u2019ve have conversations already with her about this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563365\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s the first you\u2019ve heard about it, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m like where the hell is this coming from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re right \u2013 he knows something is going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t believe him. I think it would be very stupid of me to let go of James and be like \u201cokay I\u2019m all yours\u201d because he\u2019s still doing the same thing he always did, not calling me for 24 hours or disappearing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: While the tone is different, there is still . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Calling a lot more. The data I was going to find out on my biopsy \u2013 remember the colonoscopy \u2013 I\u2019m fine; everything is fine, but that morning he was like, \u201cI know your appointment is today. I\u2019m thinking of you. I\u2019ll be here if you need me. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhere is this coming from?\u201d this is the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">kind of guy I\u2019ve been wanting all along. And then after I told him the results were fine he was like, \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d And then I didn\u2019t hear from him for the rest of the day. I heard from him that night and he said something to me like, \u201cI have to talk to her now. I\u2019m talking to her about relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">stuff. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d  I didn\u2019t hear anything else from him for the rest of the night and then the next day when I asked him \u201chow did it go?\u201d, he just dodged. And he still draws me in somehow. I fear that I\u2019m going to ruin the potential for something really, really good. I don\u2019t know if <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200353\">I have something so good in front of me, why can\u2019t I just shut the door on Brian and move on? I\u2019m so drawn to that chaos.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563365\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: One thought I have is that I think you know with Brian \u2013 this might sound odd, but I was thinking about it in this way \u2013 with Brian it\u2019s kind of a known commodity, at least in the sense that you know you\u2019re going to find excitement there, that the erotic is going to be there.  Let\u2019s face <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">it, that has some real importance to you, as well as I think the dynamic is something that you\u2019ve gotten not happy about, but at least it\u2019s more or less predictable in some ways. What I was thinking about was I think with James I was imagining you not being sure where exactly and if it\u2019s going to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200372\">like it does with Brian; or there is something that\u2019s going to feel as charged and I would say not just charged, but as important as it does with Brian. Something as meaningful and as deep with Brian. Really. It\u2019s so much more an unknown. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: I fear that it\u2019s too soon. I\u2019ve known James a month or something, but I fear that that will never evolve. It will be nice and pleasant and check, check, check \u2013 like he meets the criteria, but that excitement or that passion won\u2019t be there. I have this connection with Brian that he can totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">\u2013 I\u2019m going to use the sexual terms, but it\u2019s more than that. He always talks about owning me, that he\u2019s my daddy. There is this dynamic that I can\u2019t replicate with anyone else that I\u2019m so drawn to with Brian. Like when I was with James before I left on Sunday, he was like \u201cjust hug me for a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">bit\u201d and we got all tangled up in the couch and just held each other; and it felt so good. But it just felt different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Tell me. What was it like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: More equal.  It\u2019s weird because with Brian, when we\u2019re all curled up like that, it either feels like I\u2019m totally his, like his little helpless little girl, like daddy is there to completely protect you and take care of you, or he\u2019s a wounded animal and I\u2019m taking care of him. With James it just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">felt equal. He\u2019s not wounded and I don\u2019t know what to do with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And I wonder, too, then if it makes you feel a little bit like can you go to that place like you do with Brian with a guy like James?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s face it, I think there is something very important in that \u2013 being daddy\u2019s little girl \u2013 that\u2019s in some way speaks to a pretty important part of who you\u2019ve been and how you feel about men and the world.  You can really get in touch with that with Brian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s all I have with him. He\u2019s promising me things because he doesn\u2019t even use his words. I have to put the words in there for him, like I\u2019m creating this whole storyline in my head that his plan is to finish school and leave his wife and get a condo and I guess have a life with me. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">was saying all these weird things the other day like, \u201cMelanie, what did you want me to do? Before you even got licensure, before you got a job at GWU, did you want me to leave my wife and move in with you and get you pregnant?

He must have an idea that you\u2019re trying to find somebody who meets that. I think what\u2019s tricky for you is, again, whether you\u2019re going to be able <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">to find that kind of connection with a guy like James?  It might be that it\u2019s harder for you to go there with a guy like James, not that you can\u2019t, by the way, but with Brian it was right there. He was looking for it from you; you were looking \u2013 it was so chemistry. Talk about chemistry. You guys were <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">sympatico. Complimentary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: With James, sometimes when we\u2019re just sitting across from each other just talking and he\u2019s looking at me with \u2013 remember that sweet face that I told you about?

He\u2019s just so open with his feelings and he\u2019s told me all the time \u201cI really like you.  I don\u2019t feel this that often with people and it just feels like we fit together.

He\u2019s going to find out that maybe I am really wounded, that it\u2019s all just an act and I have daddy issues and I\u2019m not who he thinks I am. There is that concern.  (pause) When he looks at me like that or he tells me those things, I guess I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">find it hard to believe that someone could care like that, which is really pathetic because I thought I had better self-esteem than that.

Another thing is I\u2019ve always wanted someone who wants to see me a lot. I want my own space, but I want us to have a life together. So here I am leaving his house on Sunday. He kisses me goodbye and says, \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you soon, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">maybe Wednesday?\u201d My initial reaction was, \u201cAre you serious?

This is becoming serious. The next thing you know he\u2019s going to move in and the next thing you know we\u2019re going to live together and the next thing you know it\u2019s going to be like Kevin and I used to be, like roommates and he\u2019s going to be annoyed with me and I\u2019m going to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F1\">annoyed with him. That whole thing. The other thing is I\u2019ve noticed in myself that I don\u2019t label things. Like with other guys I guess I\u2019ve been more curious about, \u201cSo, what am I to you? Where is this heading?\u201d With James, I don\u2019t talk about it \u2013 he does. So when I was going to introduce him to my friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F2\">on Saturday he started teasing me and was like, \u201cSo I know that we\u2019re not going to meet your friends just yet because we\u2019re sick, but if we were to meet them tonight, how would you introduce me to your friends?\u201d He went right there and he wouldn\u2019t quit until I said \u201cboyfriend.\u201d  So this is someone who <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F3\">is not playing around, who is ready for a commitment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it, yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: When we went for a walk he was showing me how pretty the houses were.

One day I want a yard like that.\u201d He was talking about future stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah, seeing how you react.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: It makes me happy but also there is this little piece of me inside my stomach that gets butterflies and gets nervous and wants to run away. I feel like it\u2019s moving too fast, even though I guess objectively it\u2019s not.

I hear it bringing up a lot of important things because you\u2019re saying here is this guy who is really very interested, getting to know you more, looking; and it is activating <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">something. It\u2019s opening something up in you, something that kind of makes you uncomfortable, makes you kid of skeptical at times, maybe is exciting in other ways. It definitely sounds like there is excitement, too.  Feeling good about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: (crying) But I can\u2019t just shake that feeling of \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d I\u2019ve only had two serious relationships in my life, Kevin and Brian, and they\u2019ve both been so complicated and so shrouded in secrecy. This is just such a weird, new experience. (sniffling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: I know it\u2019s early, but it sounds like he really wants to be in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: He\u2019s already talking about stuff to do in the summer.

I\u2019ve been waiting to find a guy like him.

What did you have in mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Even if I don\u2019t see Brian that often, I love that connection I have with him. I know he doesn\u2019t necessarily do anything for me.

It seems important, too, there is some way in which with James there is this feeling of a guy that is really the guy that brings over the shovel and is more reliable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: Brian is the one that brought over the shovel three months later, but James is the one who actually helped me shovel my care out of the snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re sort of saying there is something about that element of being with Brian that is nonetheless important to you. It\u2019s such a contrast between the hopefulness with Brian, being hopeful and wanting and being hurt and disappointed.  And then with James it\u2019s more like he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">delivering and you don\u2019t feel like you deserve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s no disappointment. There is beyond expectations. Like I show up and there are flowers. I don\u2019t want to scare him away because we\u2019re really open with one another. I think it was Saturday night that we were taking and he was asking me about how I\u2019m feeling about the relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">overall. I think I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m used to complex, dysfunctional relationships so this relationship is different.\u201d  He was like, \u201cYeah, doesn\u2019t it just feel easy?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good word because it\u2019s like effortless and it does feel different and easy.\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200972\">it can even be a little scary.\u201d He said it first, so he must be feeling similarly because he has shared with me that his past relationships were all wounded women. That\u2019s what he was attracted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: What was it like to hear that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: Immediately, because he told me that on the first date, I remember thinking to myself \u201cbut I\u2019m not wounded.\u201d Right away I took the stance that I\u2019m strong and I\u2019m patched up and there is nothing wrong with me. But then the more I\u2019m falling for him and becoming attached, the more wounded I\u2019m feeling. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">It\u2019s weird. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It is. It\u2019s bringing up that whole feeling of do I deserve this? I don\u2019t feel wounded. I think, too, this element of what gets evoked with the relationship with Brian, what if he knows about that? What if you open yourself up to him in that way? What will happen? Almost like a question that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">you might have about the relationship. How does that fit in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve shared with him some about my family and I\u2019m careful not to dive too deep.  He shared a lot about his family, too. I\u2019m careful, though, about what I choose to share. I haven\u2019t really shared how dysfunctional of parents my father and Billy were. I\u2019ve shared with him my dad, like how he wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">show up or just wasn\u2019t reliable, drank a lot. I haven\u2019t shared how my grandfather had a sex motel. Our families are just really different. His mom is a mental health counselor and his dad is a psychologist. They\u2019re divorced. They got a divorce ten years ago or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563365\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: How old is James?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: Thirty-five.  He had a great relationship with his parents growing up, especially with his dad. He doesn\u2019t talk to mom so much anymore because I think she was diagnosed with bi-polar ten years ago, right around the divorce, and just changed completely as a person. So he doesn\u2019t talk to her and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A31\">there is a nasty court thing, like alimony thing, happening between his parents. He talks about that. (pause) I just see so much more messiness in my family. What are you supposed to talk about all that stuff? Before or after he meets them? Should I tell him about my mom\u2019s trauma history before or after <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A32\">he meets her?  Should I tell him that my stepfather is a pervert before or after? (sniggers) It just feels a lot messier. Then is he going to start to see me as more wounded if I tell him about that stuff? I bet he\u2019d be fine. I mean, he\u2019s a psychologist. I just get the sense that he\u2019s a solid, good person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I think it does get into that area within yourself, not only sharing with him the facts, but the actual feeling of what that evokes in you.  Your family and what that all feels like to you, what you describe as how you feel being from that family. All the feeling about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">CLIENT: Talking to my mom last night, I said something to her like \u201cI\u2019m just so used to complicated, difficult relationships.\u201d She was like, \u201cWell you better get un-used to it.\u201d Just like it\u2019s that easy, like snap your fingers. This is a pattern that I\u2019ve been in. This is a pattern that I\u2019ve seen between <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A71\">her and Billy. He was never there for her emotionally. I don\u2019t have a good model for that. Then look at my dad. He\u2019s a mess. So of course this is going to feel weird. This is a healthy relationship so far. I get frustrated with myself that I\u2019m still so drawn to Brian. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">CLIENT: Like I should just be stronger and just be like screw you. You\u2019ve been dicking me around for over a year. Call me if you\u2019re ever single. I\u2019m going to go on with my life. I can\u2019t do that. It would hurt him too much. (pause) It feels kind of selfish, like now that you\u2019re set with James, now you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB1\">can let go of Brian. But I feel like I\u2019d be okay. I would probably be more okay than him. I would just feel bad for him. I could picture him going back to his ways of sneaking around, being in empty relationships. What\u2019s going to happen one day when his son has a life of his own and it\u2019s just him and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB2\">his wife?  He\u2019s going to realize how unhappy he is. I\u2019m making it my problem. That\u2019s not my life. That\u2019s not my job. I think I\u2019m making it my job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I admit what you\u2019re describing reminds me of the two different kinds of embraces that you have \u2013 one where you feel like I\u2019ve got this daddy in my arms and then the other times when you feel like I\u2019ve got this wounded bird; that other side being very powerful for you as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">CLIENT: So far I don\u2019t need to take care of James. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I was thinking, too, that I get the sense from you it can be very meaningful to have a man like Brian that looks to you for support and nurturance in that way, that opens himself up in certain ways, the woundedness, and that you would look for a man that would be vulnerable, looking for a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B11\">man that kind of can go there and is in contact with his pain \u2013 not that it doesn\u2019t have its complications, too, but that there is something about him being vulnerable towards you that, I\u2019m sure, is very powerful for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563365\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">CLIENT: There are some similarities there of how I used to see Kevin, like a hurt little boy. Even in his anger when he used to stub his toe and I used to say \u201cAre you okay?\u201d and he used to yell \u201cfuck you\u201d at me. I was like oh, my God, you\u2019re like a seven-year-old little boy with ADHD whose father called <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B31\">him stupid every time he hurt himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">THERAPIST: But, boy, you can really shrug off the personal attack and see it for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">CLIENT: I did that for years. It\u2019s such a shock for people to hear. I remember telling Brian that.

He was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B71\">\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d It was always my fault. I was telling Brian, \u201cYou didn\u2019t get mad. I was waiting for you to get mad.\u201d  Or when he helped me move. Something happened with James the other day that he tends to forget and so when we left the restaurant he left his doggy bag and we got into the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B72\">car and I was like, \u201cDid you bring your burrito?\u201d He was like, \u201cOh, crap. I always do that.\u201d I was like, \u201cDo you want me to run in? I\u2019ll run back in right now.\u201d I was doing everything to kind of deescalate a situation that wasn\u2019t even escalating. Then I remembered at that moment that if Kevin had done <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B73\">that, right away he would have said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get it?\u201d or \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d (pause) It\u2019s such a weird experience just to be with someone who\u2019s regulated and responsible; normal. (sniggers)  I don\u2019t know what will happen. Right now Brian is at home taking care of his wife because she had <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B74\">to have surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">THERAPIST: She was having a hysterectomy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">CLIENT: He said it turned out to be a minor procedure because she started getting bleeding, so he had to rush her to the emergency room. The doctor said she might have to have a hysterectomy, but instead they did something minor. But that is still a possibility if she starts bleeding again. She almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB1\">couldn\u2019t have their son because there were complications in there \u2013 like she almost died having him. He texted me today when I was at work. I was like, \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d He was like, \u201cI\u2019m just doing some schoolwork. The patient is napping.\u201d Patient. (sniggers) He has to help her walk around and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB2\">all that stuff now. I\u2019m not going to see him anytime soon.  He has a lot on his plate. I almost feel like he should be happy that I found someone to take me places. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I imagine in some ways there is an easing of the pressure on him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve stopped whining to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019ve stopped whining to him, so to speak; however wanting things from him is another way to say that. Wanting him to be a boyfriend. I would imagine there is the other side of that coin, which is am I going to lose her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But he doesn\u2019t express in words what he really wants from me. All he ever says when I say, \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you want to happen with us?\u201d \u201cI told you this, Melanie. You know.\u201d He just doesn\u2019t say it.  Then the other day I brought up that my friend has been with some <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C31\">divorced guy for three months now. She\u2019s hanging out with the kids this weekend. Do you know how stupid I feel that my friends know that you have a son and I\u2019ve never even met him? He\u2019s like, \u201cI can understand that would be hard for you,\u201d but there is no follow up.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563365\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Like \u201cone day; it\u2019s coming soon.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C7\">CLIENT: Even if that did happen, how complicated would that be. Can you imagine? He finishes school. He and his wife decide to separate. All of a sudden he\u2019s going to introduce his son to a new woman? He\u2019s going to hate me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C9\">THERAPIST: How old is his son now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB\">CLIENT: Four. I\u2019ve seen so many videos of him and pictures. He\u2019s so funny and has such a sense of humor.  He went to have his picture taken with Santa over Christmas and he asked Santa, \u201cDo you think that I could help you deliver gifts?\u201d Santa said something like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB1\">do that on my own.\u201d Instead of just letting it go, Logan looks at him and says, \u201cThat\u2019s not very nice, Santa. That\u2019s kind of rude, actually.\u201d (laughs) He tells me all these stories all the time so I feel like I know him. I wish I could share that with him. (crying) It just makes me so sad that I can\u2019t. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB2\">I\u2019ve cried to him so many times about how that\u2019s all that I want, but nothing changes. (sniffling) Now I\u2019m the one made to feel bad that I\u2019m with someone who\u2019s making me happy.  Now he\u2019s making me feel bad. He says things like, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that I promised you all these things and you can\u2019t be faithful <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB3\">to me.\u201d I was like, \u201cBrian, you\u2019re married. I can\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being unfaithful when I\u2019m cheating on my married boyfriend.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I think, though, that he\u2019s legitimately feeling hurt and rejected; even though, of course, the situation is set up for that to happen at some point or it\u2019s certainly the potential. In other words yeah, there is that reproach element, but I almost feel like it\u2019s a way to justify the legitimacy <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200CD1\">of his feelings that whatever the case, no matter who is at fault or responsible, it\u2019s that rejected wounded bird kind of feeling in him.  It must. When you get some distance it must elicit that kind of feeling. Even if you\u2019re exactly right about the situation that he isn\u2019t really able to go there with <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200CD2\">you right now, even though he says he was going to, I think it comes much more from that place of woundedness that he feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CF\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t believe that he would say \u201ccondo\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about our relationship\u201d I was like, \u201cTalking with who? Talking with your wife?\u201d When I ask him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever tell me about this stuff?\u201d he doesn\u2019t have an answer. That\u2019s why I\u2019m like is it a lie? Do I believe it? (pause)  <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200CF1\">I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know what will happen. I\u2019m just taking it day by day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I think there is a lot with James that is [abundant with things] (ph?) about yourself, about how you feel, about what you\u2019re looking for. And I think a lot of the risks that come. I was just thinking about how it sounds like you want both elements that are existent with both men. You don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D11\">want to have to lose that experience that you have with Brian, not only because you have feelings about Brian himself, but also because I think you just want a man to be able to know this about you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563365\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D3\">CLIENT: Like a repairman experience, in a way, because I never felt that with my dad or Billy. I get paid on Friday and I\u2019ll pay you again, but it will probably be another measly $50 check, just because I have to do the Juris prudence. So be patient with me.
