I requested VN (sp) at all times, because trying to get into a car \u2013 they put you in the backseat and I have to lay down in order to get into the car and lift the leg up, and it\u2019s hanging out like this, and then work myself in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Same way getting out.

Didn\u2019t they send a car for me come Monday, going to the doctor\u2019s? So I refused to get into the car.  It took 45 minutes for another van to come get me. I got to the doctor\u2019s office <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">just exactly almost 3:30, on time for my apartment, after I had to call and say I might be a few minutes late, and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Louise can come in whenever she wants.\u201d So I got there, had my feet done, waited downstairs. My pickup time \u2013 you have to give them an hour, even if your appointment <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">time is only 15 minutes. You have to give them an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh, between drop off and pickup?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I called them up.  They said they\u2019d send a van. Quarter past 5:00 I was still (inaudible). So I walked <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">across the street with my walker and got on the MBTA bus, got to the end of my street and I just had to walk down my street, the length from here to there, your end there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: How was it getting on the bus?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t bad because he goes \u2013 he lowers it down so you can get into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: One of those kneeling buses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: The only thing is I have this, and some lady got on with a baby carriage, and she\u2019s trying to get by me, and I\u2019m lifting this up. I wouldn\u2019t mind but those seats, the first three seats rise up so you can put a person on a wheelchair there.  You think the guy would do it so the lady could put <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">the carriage in that space? Oh no. She had the back door blocked. I had the front door blocked. I says, oh, he was real nice, this driver.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, what did they do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: The MBTA driver, he could have lifted up the seats so you could put a wheelchair there or she could put the baby carriage in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: But no. She blocked up the back doorway with the baby carriage, and of course I\u2019ve got this blocked up at the front because I\u2019m the first seat there. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t give a fuck.

We had gone to the store, and I put $10.00 worth of gas in his car, then we went to get a steak and cheese sub, but we wound up getting pizza. He took the whole pizza home with him. I had a clean slice of cheese pizza, he did too, and the other pizza he took home was a chicken and bacon <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">pizza, large, mind you, so that wound up costing me $25.00.

Keisha wasn\u2019t home. She was in Lizzy for the night. She was staying over at a friend\u2019s house. Deborah wasn\u2019t home either. So he went home with the pizza. I went back to my place. After about a half hour he calls me and tells me to meet him outside again. Like an idiot I did. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">We wound up going over to his friend Trevor\u2019s house, which I stayed in the car, he got out. Trevor and some girls were up on the porch, but we wound up taking his friend Trevor to Stop and Shop to get barbeque sauce, because Trevor was having a cookout. So that was all right. We left there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Did you go to the cookout? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: No. So we left Trevor\u2019s house, and that\u2019s when he went into the liquor store with the $10.00 I gave him, came out and says to me, \u201cI have to go to my mother\u2019s house. I have to put on the water for the outside of the house. So I said, all right. He dropped me off at home, an hour, still no Mark. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">So I called him up, and I could hear a big party in the background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: I said, where are you, over at Trevor\u2019s?

And I know also \u2013 I imagine in some way you must have wanted some normalcy, some way of getting out of that house and having something that felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED1\">kind of \u2013 boy, if you\u2019re really disturbed by something you see, you want something that brings you back down to earth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: Even Mark said he couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: He did see it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Wow.

So she gave one to Mary, and she ate it, then after that she made me a fried egg sandwich.  She left the (inaudible) with the fried eggs. Mary\u2019s standing over my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F71\">shoulder. \u201cAre you going to eat the yolk?\u201d I said, yeah, I save that for last. I eat all the white stuff first. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d So then I ate it. She says, \u201cThat really looked good.\u201d I had to make her a fucking egg sandwich. Before she came Deborah had already taken the cream over to the lady next <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F72\">door\u2019s house and put it away, because Mary takes the cream and puts it in tonic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Does she use a lot of it or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.

Mary just sees it, and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">THERAPIST: Boy, these hungry relatives of yours that want to eat everything you\u2019ve got.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">CLIENT: She don\u2019t eat.

Mark had come over that morning. He said to Deborah, \u201cWe\u2019re all set for Six Flags.\u201d He said, \u201cKeisha said she\u2019d go.\u201d So it\u2019s supposed to be me, Mark, Deborah, and Ivy, and Darla going to Six Flags. I said, looks like Six Flags ain\u2019t happening now, Deborah. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F1\">I can get Mary\u2019s car for the day if you want to go up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: Oh, because Mark has a car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Right. Well it\u2019s a long summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. Today\u2019s conversation with Darla was she wanted to commit suicide. She\u2019s just not a happy camper. She tries to talk to her father about it and he doesn\u2019t want to hear it.  He just misses her to death. He wants her to apologize to Pat for treating Pat the way she did or doing the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">she did. Darla says, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing to her. Why should I? She\u2019s nothing to me?\u201d So Darla\u2019s set on that, but we tried telling Darla that Pat did love her, and Pat\u2019s been in contact with us almost every other night, or day. She\u2019s completely moved out of her father\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s over at the grandparents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah, took the bed, everything. Everything that belongs to her is over at her grandmothers.  I said, why don\u2019t you talk to Nana Margie about this and let Nana Margie know how you feel about your father. Maybe Nana Margie can talk to him. Why don\u2019t you talk to Uncle Bobby, or Papa Joe? He loves <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B1\">my Deborah. Darla said to Papa Joe, and she\u2019d have that car right there the next day. That\u2019s how much Joe loves her. Of course now Deborah wants to call her brother and talk to her brother about Darla getting emancipated and coming here to live with her mother permanently.  I said, where you going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B2\">live, Deborah? It has been two years, almost three years, that you\u2019ve been here, Deborah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Is that right?

It was winter, Christmastime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: 2012.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: Which she called him up on the night of her birthday, and he lives in Gloucester now, and he came all the way from Gloucester\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: Bennett?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah, and picked her up and took her home with him so she could get laid for her birthday, which I knew, because I said, if that\u2019s what you want to do, go ahead and do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: How did you feel about it?

So I went to check on my \u2013 I had one of those cases where <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B1\">you do your pills, Monday, Tuesday, so forth.

I\u2019m saying to myself, shit, either her or her son took them.

You wanted to see him, spend the night with him, have a night to yourselves. Ivy\u2019s gone. Sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A51\">like Deborah was gone.

Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">CLIENT: She doesn\u2019t want Pat pretending she\u2019s her mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">THERAPIST: She wants the real deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been hard on her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. Evelyn and Mindy, they get to go to their father\u2019s every other weekend. I don\u2019t get to go to my mother\u2019s every weekend. Guess who paid for the plane tickets? Heath paid for the plane tickets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">THERAPIST: What did you think of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">CLIENT: I was in total shock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20203\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you said he paid for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20205\">CLIENT: When she comes here she wants to go shopping in thrift stores.

Deborah never went, you know? It was at the point that Darla was my sidekick.

So of course I got the blame for her having <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202111\">to give birth to Darla because I wouldn\u2019t get her an abortion. I said, not up to me to pay for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20213\">THERAPIST: I think it also speaks to her feeling \u2013 Deborah\u2019s feeling that she felt completely \u2013 I don\u2019t know how complete it is, but feeling she couldn\u2019t be a mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20215\">CLIENT: Well you know how some people definitely know they don\u2019t want kids?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20219\">CLIENT: Deborah was that way.
