I feel like this weather has left me with this stuffed-up nose which is for no reason. It didn\u2019t even feel like it was that much warmer this weekend until now when it\u2019s like, oh yeah, it was. [1:27] I went to Chicago and \u2013 Oh, yeah. I saw you in the morning on Friday. So that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">afternoon I got into a big argument with Stephanie. We\u2019ve been getting into stupid arguments lately. Like, misunderstandings and miscommunicatings and not \u2013 And basically, I was saying I\u2019m going to need her to be \u2013 I was saying (inaudible at 2:00) that morning and then I was like, I need you to be on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">your like, \u2018cause it was so gray and yucky, I was like, you know, entertainer mode for the ride to keep me awake and blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">And then I was like, I usually don\u2019t drive on Friday nights, but \u2018case I\u2019m too tired, but since you\u2019re coming with me I\u2019m taking advantage, or whatever. And then she\u2019s like, okay, I will, but just for the record I said originally I would be fine going Saturday morning, but then we planned for Friday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">night.[2:28] Then I wrote back \u2013 we\u2019re e-mailing \u2013 and I wrote back, Oh, I must have missed that or whatever. And she somehow interpreted it as like, no you didn\u2019t say that. So then she wrote back like, I did say that. And I was like, no I know, I wasn\u2019t \u2013 And it just turned into this, so then it went <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">from there. And we were both writing in caps and really annoyed for no reason about whether we\u2019re leaving Friday or Saturday and at this point she just would rather take a train and be calm. And that I\u2019m stressing her out, and it can\u2019t be \u2013 It was just stupid. And it was similar to the night before <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">when we had that stupid misunderstanding on the phone where I was like, well, can we just be done talking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Like, I don\u2019t understand. So then finally, I said that. I was like, can you just write back to this e-mail saying, have a great day, see you at 7:00 as planned. And so she did and it was fine. And then we didn\u2019t talk about it further and it was fine. So then that happened. We were fine on the car ride <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">there. On the way back yesterday, though, a couple of times that happened about the dumbest shit. Like, what they meant by the countdown from the top songs this week in 2006 on the XM station we had on. No, but they mean this. No, but I think they mean this. No, but what \u2013 and it was so stupid, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">we\u2019re like yelling at each other about it. And I\u2019m, what\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Right. It keeps happening. [3:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: So we didn\u2019t actually get to the bottom of why that\u2019s happening. We just settled that dispute and had a fine rest of the ride. I feel like she doesn\u2019t \u2013 like, if Lucas, the whole thing comes up or whatever, I feel like she avoids talking about it or changes the subject or just doesn\u2019t. But at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">one point during the car ride yesterday \u2013 I tend to feel a little sad sometimes driving at night or just on the way back from that visit. I just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I get emotional or something. And she was, you know, sensitive to that. And then I think, you know, and that was nice. She was what can I do? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">Do you want a snack? Do you want a cigarette? What do you want? You know, she just wanted me to feel better, but she didn\u2019t ask if I wanted to talk about it. She was just kind of like, how can I help with something to get your mind off it, I guess. So I don\u2019t know. It was uncomfortable. I haven\u2019t ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">talked to her about it, so it\u2019s not like something that I\u2019m missing. The visit was really good. I got to meet her sister\u2019s baby who is really cute and my cousin\u2019s baby is really cute.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, that was really nice. Nice visit. And then on the way out we stopped in to see my grandmother which was nice. And Stephanie came in and she remembered Stephanie, you know, a little bit. You know, because she hadn\u2019t seen her since was a fat 10-year-old, probably.[5:37] But she really doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">belong in that place, and, you know, my father and my uncle go back and forth about my father says he\u2019s going to look into Hebrew rehab. And my uncle says, so do it. And then he doesn\u2019t do it. And then they\u2019re talking about this doctor and my dad\u2019s still worrying about getting money back from his brother <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">from the move in the summer from moving my grandmother\u2019s house out. And, you know, they\u2019re just different about these dumb things. And their mother is in the facility where she doesn\u2019t belong, where people who are arthritic and can\u2019t function on their own who are senile and just screaming and drooling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200193\">or who have some other sort of actual physical ailment, not just like, I\u2019m old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">And I swear, the reason she\u2019s not walking is because she\u2019s in that place. Because if she were in a place that had less focus on people that needed the physical therapy to keep on living or something, that they would be able to \u2013 Something is wrong. I just \u2013 \u2018cause she can walk when she starts to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">a little bit of physical therapy. [6:48] It\u2019s not miles. I don\u2019t know. But I was up \u2013 she is so lucid and so there and with it and knows she\u2019s not supposed to be there. And it\u2019s not good and I don\u2019t think, you know, any place we could afford wouldn\u2019t be great. But I really would like to see what we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">could do. So I was trying to separate myself from the whole thing, but these two idiots aren\u2019t going to do anything and, quite frankly she\u2019ll be 95 in October, but her brain is there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">There\u2019s no \u2013 I mean, physically maybe she\u2019ll go soon. Who knows? I don\u2019t know. But I just feel not right having her there. It just feels wrong to me. And, you know, Stephanie was saying how, you know, that I\u2019m going to need to \u2013 if anything\u2019s going to happen, I\u2019m going to need to get involved. [7:51] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">And I was like, I know, but it\u2019s just hard and it\u2019s time-consuming and it\u2019s really difficult dealing with the two of them, because they just yell at each other and then yell at me. And then one blames the other for this and I have to pick sides. And she goes, yeah, no more letting them doing the commitments, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">so I\u2019ll take this out of your next charity work, which, you know, she has a point. I don\u2019t know how to approach it. [8:19] I mean, why is he worrying about a measly couple grand maybe or something that Harrison owes him for the move. I mean, all he\u2019s going to do is piss Harrison off. I mean, as far <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">as Harrison\u2019s concerned, he doesn\u2019t owe my father shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">It\u2019s my father\u2019s fault that it took so long, you know, according to my uncle, to get her moved out of there anyway, even though it\u2019s both of their faults. It\u2019s just, you know, really dysfunctional. And it\u2019s like, hard, because I don\u2019t have any money, so I can\u2019t just scoop her up and take care of it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">you know? And they \u2013 and since it\u2019s both of their money and her money, they need to \u2013 so I\u2019m not sure how to approach this, but I don\u2019t want her to be there any longer. It\u2019s not good. She sits in her chair all day, surrounded by crazy people, staring at the TV all day. It\u2019s terrible. She\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">turn into senile. She\u2019s gonna turn senile and arthritic and, you know, whatever. She remembers stuff. She remembered Stephanie\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t remember the name and then Stephanie came and she\u2019s like, oh yeah, you know. She knew. So I don\u2019t know. And Harrison doesn\u2019t want to be involved. {9:48] Harrison, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">you know, Christopher should do it and Christopher should take her, \u2018cause Christopher left and never came back. He moved to Providence and never came back and I\u2019ve been her all these years and taking care of her and visiting her and doing this and doing that, which is true. Like, let\u2019s be real. He\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F4\">been the one taking her to doctor\u2019s appointments.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">He\u2019s been the one going there every week to see her. You know, my father breezes in and out when he wants to. That part of what my uncle says is true. I don\u2019t know stuff about the financial stuff, actually. Like, I don\u2019t really know what goes on there. But my father makes all these empty promises of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">like, going to research this and get this paperwork and do this, and doesn\u2019t follow through. And then, you know, I mean, case in point. It\u2019s February and he\u2019s trying to get money from my uncle for something that happened \u2013 he\u2019s looking for the bill from the movers from August. Why didn\u2019t you fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200212\">do it then? It\u2019s been months now, and also \u2013 and now of course, my uncle is also pissed, because the present that they got for the baby was unacceptable in my uncle\u2019s eyes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: The present that your uncle got. [10:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes. So there was this whole drama surrounding the wedding, because okay, this is his niece, okay? His brother\u2019s oldest daughter, even though it\u2019s his step-daughter. Whatever. And apparently there\u2019s drama, because this is \u2013 I am on my uncle\u2019s side. Tracy and my dad got them some artsy-fartsy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">tea set. Nothing on the registry. No check to go with it. Artsy-fartsy tea set. Here you go. First of all, 25-year-olds who are getting married don\u2019t want a fucking tea set. Second of all, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019 know how to explain that you can\u2019t do that. Like, you can\u2019t just get somebody something because you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">think it would be a nice thing for them to have for a wedding. You get something that they would say hey look, I need this and I want this because it matches everything we\u2019re building our house around. Here\u2019s this random tea set that maybe looks similar to \u2013 whatever. [12:15] and they only got the tea <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200253\">set. And God knows how much it cost. Who cares? My dad\u2019s well, it\u2019s a very nice tea set. What do you mean? You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">So there\u2019s a whole drama. I don\u2019t know if the tea set got given back. Maybe it got kept. Either way, my father ended up writing them a check for $500, because my uncle basically was like, you didn\u2019t give her a gift. Give her a gift. Okay, so then the baby thing came around and I said to him, listen, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">have Tracy look at the registry. Choose a couple of things, maybe one small thing, one big thing. No. Oh, this is what happened. Because he had said, oh we got the baby something from Jordan. And I said, do me a favor. Get something off the registry. Also, that\u2019s very nice. Jordan. Great. Get something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">off the registry. So the thing he gets from Jordan are these tchotchke knitted stuffed animal things, crocheted, but not even like stuffed animals. They\u2019re hard, so it\u2019s like a decoration for a baby\u2019s room, or something. A pig. To which, my uncle\u2019s big thing about it, was who gets a pig from Jordan, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200273\">which is absurd. [13:30] Okay. And a little blue elephant with the tallest and then a kippah. But that\u2019s really not cute. Not nice. And of course Joseph, her husband is like, I like the elephant. You know, like, whatever. He\u2019s kind of funny. But as soon as I come in he\u2019s like, I\u2019ve got to show you what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200274\">your dad and Tracy got us. And it\u2019s like, on the bottom it\u2019s like, hand-made by Jewish artisans. And he was like, I can just picture your father \u2013 this my cousin\u2019s husband speaking. I can just picture Christopher picking it up and being like, oh \u2013 this, not even like, oh, it\u2019s a cute pig and an elephant <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200275\">for the nursery. Like, oh, this is hand-made by Jewish artisans. Like, they\u2019ll love this. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">And then in addition to that, she got them a couple outfits from the registry. Which, okay \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t satisfied. I think they should have gotten one of the bigger items. They should haven\u2019t gotten a floor thing. Like, something significant that the baby\u2019s going to fucking use. Not an outfit that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200291\">going to grow out of in two seconds that has fifty thousand outfits. This kid has so many clothes they\u2019re never going to be able to put him in. I mean, why outfits, Tracy. Like, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not the last thing that was left. It was like, oh, I just think it\u2019s so cute. It would be nice to give this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200292\">But give something significant. I don\u2019t know where their brains are. And they\u2019re treating it as if this is not family, when they\u2019re getting Tracy\u2019s brother\u2019s kids\u2019 stuff. They\u2019re getting them, you know, nice things all the time. (pause) And the fucking ugly \u2013they\u2019re ugly. They\u2019re not even cute things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200293\">for the nursery. Not tasteful. It doesn\u2019t match the d\u00e9cor. [15:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">It\u2019s not like they asked them, what colors are you using. I mean, the nursery\u2019s purple and grey. He\u2019s got a blue elephant, you know. And then Tracy sends an e-mail to Joseph and Sharon saying, hi, I wanted to check if you got the present. Like, she sent it through the baby registry. So that I can delete <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B1\">all of the e-mails correspondence regarding the purchase and the sending. Right. And like, A, you don\u2019t need to make up an excuse. Like, it\u2019s okay that you\u2019re fishing for a thank-you note right now. Like, you didn\u2019t get a thank-you, so you wanted to know. Okay. Just say, hey, just wanted to check, did <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B2\">you get the gift I sent? We don\u2019t need to know. You\u2019re just making yourself look even more insane. What are you \u2013 so I can delete the e-mails? And then what, so it can sit in the trash? Are you emptying your trash every time? What about your sent e-mails. Like, who gives a shit. Call the company if <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B3\">you lose the e-mail confirmation and they never got the fight. It was so strange that she sent that e-mail. And it just \u2013everything that they\u2019re doing lately is just like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2002D\">THERAPIST: My impression is that, you know, in a way you actually feel insulted by it. Like, angry with how they\u2019re being, embarrassed about how they\u2019re being and like, it\u2019s kind of an insult to you. It doesn\u2019t reflect well on you. [16:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2002F\">CLIENT: Granted, I\u2019m making such a big deal of this baby, and this is my family and I\u2019m trying to be close with my family, you know. I don\u2019t have a sister, you know, this whole thing. Right. And then they go and get this shitty fucking gift. And this is their only aunt or uncle on their father\u2019s side. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2002F1\">You know what I mean? \u2018Cause it\u2019s a big deal. He\u2019s their only uncle. He\u2019s \u2013 And I mean, Sharon\u2019s a little bit more like, who cares, because it\u2019s not \u2013 She\u2019s got her mother\u2019s side of the family. It\u2019s like not a, you know.

Cadence is my younger cousin, sorry, who is in college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20035\">THERAPIST: Sharon\u2019s sister.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20037\">CLIENT: Yes. Half-sister. Right. Because Jessica and Harrison \u2013 my uncle Harrison married Jessica who already had Sharon and then when me and Sharon were like, ten, Cadence was born and then a few years later Richard was born. So Cadence came \u2013 she\u2019s in school in Chicago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20039\">THERAPIST: And Richard\u2019s in high school<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">CLIENT: And Richard\u2019s in high school. He lives in Chicago with his parents. And so Cadence came for the same day that I was going to be there, so we could all have \u2013 meet Leo together and everything. And she always gets advice from me and Joseph and Sharon when we\u2019re all together and, you know, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B1\">she\u2019s in college, she\u2019s a sophomore and she\u2019s trying to figure her life out. And she\u2019s come from a very \u2013 she always went to temple, lived in a very religious neighborhood. Was kind of forced to be very religious and then got to college and got her belly button pierced and, you know, stopped eating <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B2\">kosher and the whole thing. Stopped going to temple, the whole thing. Stopped wearing skirts, everything. I mean, she wasn\u2019t really doing it in her free time anyway. She was only doing it for school reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">TEHRAPIST: But the () is a big change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a big change for her. Eating meat and milk. Very strange, but fine. [18:40] so she \u2013 and she\u2019s a very sensitive girl. So she was like, started to cry because she was talking about how she doesn\u2019t want to go home, because daddy is so mean, and daddy was yelling at her and daddy this and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">he was so mean and yelling at her and da, da, da. And me and Sharon were like, listen, you cannot take it personally with him. You\u2019re learning, because you\u2019re new to this, you\u2019re an adult speaking to him thing. You know like, we\u2019re a little bit more used to it and we have years more experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">Like, it\u2019s not about \u2013 and I was like, and honestly started to say most of his anger lately is directed towards my father, so do not take it personally. They\u2019re having big issues. Whatever. And that made her feel a little better, and of course she talked to her father and it was fine. He was okay, love <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">you. Whatever. He\u2019s just got a temper like me. You know, he\u2019s very reactive. But yeah. I am. It is, reflecting, it\u2019s just that behavior. And they\u2019re just making themselves \u2013 isolating themselves more and more. Jessica, my aunt, after the baby was born called my mother. I mean, at my little brother\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200412\">bar mitzvah is when they started to get close again, I think. My aunt \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20043\">THERAPIST: They being? [20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20045\">CLIENT: My aunt and my mom and my uncle. \u2018Cause my mom was at my brother\u2019s bar mitzvah. My younger brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20047\">THERAPIST: Your aunt and your mom. So you mean Jessica and Layla, your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20049\">CLIENT: Jessica and Diane, my mom. Yeah. \u2018Cause you know, she was in the family forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I get it. I just wanted to make sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. Right. And, you know, Jessica asks a lot of advice about Cadence, \u2018cause she\u2019s got problems and depression and, you know, Michael and \u2013 so she\u2019s been going to my mom for advice. So I think Jessica is kind of excited to have my mom back in the family. And so when the baby was born she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D1\">called my mom and they talked for an hour or more. And Jessica had said to me already three times, the next time you come, bring your mother. You\u2019ll stay at my house. We\u2019ll see the baby and we\u2019ll hang out. She\u2019s excited. And she would never \u2013 we would never catch her putting such invitations out to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D2\">Tracy. There\u2019s just no relationship there. And partially because she\u2019s deaf, you know. And she came into the family later. I mean, granted, she\u2019s been married to my father longer than my mother was married to my father. Still, my mother\u2019s been in the family obviously longer, because she had those years on her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s really because she\u2019d never be close to Tracy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not it. Right. And they feel like they can\u2019t relate to my dad and Tracy, and I can\u2019t either. So, you know. And Uncle Harrison was disappointed, because, you know, he loves me and Michael and was very excited when Jesse came along, but doesn\u2019t have a relationship with him and feels badly <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">about that.[21:42] But he also feels like he can\u2019t relate to \u2013 thinks he\u2019s a little strange. You know, he\u2019s \u2013 Tracy is all over him all the time. You know, it\u2019s just \u2013 I feel badly about it and I feel like \u2013 Then I feel bad and like I\u2019m betraying them if I feel more on my uncle\u2019s side or feel the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200512\">my uncle feels. I feel a little guilty. Oh, but it\u2019s my father and stepmother. I feel bad talking shit or whatever. Talking trash about them, but I have to agree, I think that those gifts sucked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">I think it\u2019s really weird that she specified, you know, that she wanted to delete the \u2013 just the whole interaction is very strange. It\u2019s weird that they chose outfits. I mean, and I\u2019m sure it was just Tracy. I don\u2019t know. And then my uncle, yesterday when called me to rant about the pig from Jordan <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">was like, I think it\u2019s all Tracy\u2019s influence.[22:58] So \u2013 \u2018Cause he listens to kind of whatever she says, and just kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It feels like an impossible situation. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do, so I\u2019m just going to try to help my grandmother. I don\u2019t know. You know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)[23:55] I\u2019m not quite sure what to say. You know, some things are clear that you I mean, both Stephanie visited with your grandmother, you know so your dad and the gift are trying to deal with somebody who you can tell is being impossible. And you\u2019re sort of angry and frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">and, I don\u2019t know. It kind of makes sense, but \u2013 and helpless.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20057\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20059\">THERAPIST: But I feel like there\u2019s something more there that I can\u2019t quite put my finger on to do with. Strange to say, but kind of how personal it seems to feel to you. I said that to you before about feeling kind of insulting to you the way your father does, as though you\u2019re responsible for him. [25:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s sort of like it\u2019s not just like he\u2019s doing something shitty and you\u2019re like, oh fuck, yeah, there goes my father doing something shitty or thoughtless. It\u2019s kind of like, oh, my God, he\u2019ll never learn, so it\u2019s on you that he does or something. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or something. And also, just like very directly, I didn\u2019t have enough money to get her one of the bigger items that I would have loved to have gotten her. And so the fact that it wasn\u2019t an automatic for them to do so felt like, I don\u2019t know. [26:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">THERAPIST: Is part of that where it\u2019s like you wanted your family to be getting her good stuff and you don\u2019t have a lot of money. That means your dad\u2019s got to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">CLIENT: Pick up the slack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right. Which he could, but he can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">CLIENT: And he doesn\u2019t. And I said like, I was very specific when I was like, look at the registry with Tracy and pick something like, one of the bigger items that she needs. One of the necessity items.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">THERAPIST: I mean that\u2019s why they have registries. It\u2019s not hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">CLIENT: I mean, and sure there\u2019s outfits on registries for people that like, need to spend a little bit of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Right. No, you\u2019re the uncle. You go on and you find something like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">CLIENT: The bottle sanitizer. The Diaper Genie. I don\u2019t know. Like, even crib sheets would have been better than outfits. [27:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. Or if they registered for some nice decoration for the baby\u2019s room, or something to go on the changing table or whatever. I know what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: I mean, even my mother knitted a hat for her. Knitted. And knitted it to make sure she had it in time for the shower even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">THERAPIST: That was very thoughtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m dreading \u2013 I mean, I know if I talk to my uncle and I say, you know, I want to help you guys figure out a better place for Grandma. Because my uncle feeling the last time I talked to him was, talk to your father, because he needs to find a better place for her and he said he was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200771\">to, and he hasn\u2019t. \u2018Cause my uncle\u2019s going to be like yeah, good. Go ahead. Do it. And then I\u2019m going to have to talk to my father. And he\u2019s going to like, well Harrison this and Harrison that. [28:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">And meanwhile, poor Harrison \u2013 Honestly, my grandmother for some reason hold my dad up here. You know. Well, I\u2019m using Christopher as the go-between for what\u2019s going on so I know what\u2019s going on. Or, you know, somebody was \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I told you this, but my Uncle Harrison was at the nursing home <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">\u2013 I think I told my mother this. That, one of the people that Harrison always sees when he goes to visit her was saying to \u2013 Oh, you\u2019re very lucky to have him. You\u2019re very lucky that he comes. My Grandmother can\u2019t hear unless you talk in her ear. And my uncle said \u2013 and she said, what is she saying? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200792\">And she\u2019s thinking always thinking everybody\u2019s talking trash by the way. What did she say? Cover your watch. [29:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: Like, close your purse, \u2018cause everybody\u2019s always out to get you. And he says to her, he repeats it. He says, oh, you\u2019re lucky that you have me. You\u2019re lucky to have me, that I come, your know, that I\u2019m able to come. She says, oh. You know, I have another son. Right. And Harrison\u2019s like, who\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D1\">here? As if she needed, you know, but I have this other son who\u2019s a doctor in Providence, you know. And so there\u2019s this whole \u2013 and Harrison feels resentful of my dad for that, for going to Providence and never coming back for not being a good big brother to him, he feels. He feels he was never really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D2\">a good \u2013 He never felt like he loved him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the age difference, roughly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: Six, seven or eight years. \u2018Cause my uncle\u2019s the youngest, then my Auntie Mattie who passed away, who committed suicide, and then my dad. And so I think it\u2019s like six years. So you know, but the time my uncle was born, my dad was doing \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s even eight years, you know. But anyway, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200811\">I haven\u2019t wanted to get in the middle, but now I just \u2013 this recent visit with Grandma just really made me feel that I can\u2019t stand to see her there anymore in that place.[31:15] She doesn\u2019t belong there. The people are senile. She\u2019s like, I\u2019m not in a nursing home, I\u2019m in a senility home, an insanity <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200812\">home. You know. On the bright side, I think it\u2019s made her a little less racist, because she has all these black nurses and, you know, some of them she doesn\u2019t like, but then some of her favorite nurses are the black ones. And I think it\u2019s just made her a little bit less racist, this whole experience, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200813\">which is great. I mean, not to say that I could bring in, you know, my half-black baby and she\u2019s be like, oh, it looks so cute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">But, it\u2019s made her more tolerant in her old \u2013 maybe it\u2019s also just old age and she\u2019s kind of, like, well, you\u2019re wiping my ass, what am I supposed to do, you know. Anyway. You know, and they lose her clothes. She\u2019s always wearing like, some schmatta sweatshirt that we don\u2019t know where it came from like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200831\">\u2013 So this is the thing I have to take on, but I just know it\u2019s going to be really stressful for me, and so it\u2019s why I\u2019ve been avoiding it. But I can\u2019t avoid it. And also, I\u2019ve been kind of hoping like, my father would actually stick to his word. You know, and this is his mother. And why are you chasing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200832\">Harrison down for the money. This is your mother. This is what you do. Shell out a little bit of money and you don\u2019t chase each other around for it. [32:42] You figure it out when she\u2019s dead, please.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">Like, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s so much money going around. Anyway, who cares, Dad? You know? I mean, my mom\u2019s even said to me, don\u2019t worry about any money you feel like you owe me or I give to you or whatever. Because I know eventually, you know, you\u2019ll pay it forward. Like, you\u2019re going to have to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200851\">care of me anyway. (pause) So I have to figure out how to approach this. And the thing is, you know, that whole oh, Tracy should be involved and e-mail with Tracy so that she, you know. I don\u2019t think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: Tracy should be involved with \u2013 [33:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: Everything. Always e-mail Tracy. because she\u2019s the one that keeps the schedule and keeps it, you know. But then that blew up in my face a number of times with these e-mail things to her. And I went through and whatever, and my father not knowing about \u2013 This happened a while ago. Like some stuff, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">and quite frankly, it seems like she doesn\u2019t give a shit what\u2019s going on with my grandmother. You know, and they come back and I say, how is she? [34:08] Oh, she\u2019s doing very good, very good. She\u2019s doing well. She\u2019s good. We had a nice visit. Every single time I see her, she talks about how much she <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200892\">hates it there. How it\u2019s a senility home. How these people are crazy and she hates being around them. How she doesn\u2019t belong here. How they don\u2019t give her enough attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B\">Every single time that I talk to her or visit with her. But somehow, well maybe because, you know, she has him up here on this pedestal that when they talk maybe she is just saying it\u2019s fine or whatever. But I kind of doubt it. I\u2019m pretty sure that she has to like, touch on it. I think he\u2019s so in his <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B1\">own world and Tracy can\u2019t hear, so she\u2019s just like, oh yeah, she\u2019s just like, oh yeah, she seems good, you know. She took a nap in her chair. So I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s involved at all. I don\u2019t think that she gives a shit, it seems like. \u2018Cause if she did, she\u2019d be on my father being like this, whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B2\">(pause) I feel like he helped out more on her grandparents died.[35:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I see \u2013 I\u2019m sort of trying to figure also like, kind of where I am in this. And my first thought was, yeah, maybe I\u2019m sort of like your mom a little when you\u2019re talking about your dad and you\u2019re frustrated and upset. Oh my God, that fucker. What the hell\u2019s he doing? Can you believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D1\">that shit? But then sometimes you\u2019re talking more about something a bit different which is if anything there\u2019s a strand of your feelings about sort of therapy and me that comes from him, which is, he doesn\u2019t really ever do anything for you. [36:28] I mean, there have been ways he\u2019s helped you out, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D2\">there are always so many strings attached that I imagine more of the time you\u2019d rather he hadn\u2019t done anything in the first place. And that\u2019s when he does do something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">CLIENT: Exactly. Which is few and far between.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">THERAPIST: So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s disappointment, but there\u2019s that. It\u2019s also like, you sort of get nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I don\u2019t feel that way about you. Is that what you\u2019re suggesting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">THERAPIST: What I\u2019m suggesting is that like, I don\u2019t think you feel that way in general about me. That\u2019s not my impression, nor about like, to therapy. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d still be here if you really felt that way.[37:19] I guess I do think there\u2019s sort of, in the way that you can want, even though <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200951\">you know that I won\u2019t, you want me to tell you well, try this. Here\u2019s some advice about that. Here\u2019s what I think I would do. I mean, because you\u2019re talking about all these impossible situations. And I think it seems reasonable to me that in a way you want me to have some suggestions. Like, all right. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200952\">Here\u2019s what to do. Try and help your grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">You don\u2019t have a lot of money to do it yourself. There\u2019s this whole blow-up between your dad and your uncle. You don\u2019t want to get in the middle of them too much, but you\u2019re going to kind of have to if you want to do something. Here\u2019s how to handle it. I get what you said about him. He sounds like this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200971\">Try that. And Harrison, do this. You know, I imagine you want help like that at times. And like I say, I know you know that I don\u2019t generally talk like that, and the reasons for that, I think. But it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want it and you\u2019re not feeling sort of stuck and stymied by a lot of these situations. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200972\">I think that \u2013 at that level I think you probably feel like you don\u2019t get anything from me. Not generally \u2013 I\u2019m not even saying I don\u2019t think you\u2019d actually rather have me work that way than the way that I work. But like I said, I think you might have a strand of how you feel relates to him.

I can\u2019t talk to my brother about it, because he\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019ll start using again or something. He\u2019s too busy \u2013 he can\u2019t \u2013 \u2018cause he\u2019s dealing with his own whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200991\">I can\u2019t talk to my mom about it, \u2018cause she\u2019s dealt with it for enough years she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with my father anymore and she has to field him enough with my brother and this right turn thing and getting him a job and getting him an apartment that she doesn\u2019t want to deal with him about other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009B\">So it does leave me feeling like \u2013 I mean, Sharon\u2019s not going to really be able to help me, \u2018cause she\u2019s got a baby and is kind of like, totally out of it anyway, \u2018cause it\u2019s not really her grandmother. She doesn\u2019t really have that relationship with her. Her dad is too young to do anything. So I am <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009B1\">kind of feeling like I\u2019m in this place where \u2013 so that\u2019s why I think you hear me kind of \u2013 exactly. Like, kind of trying to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Looking for some backup. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F\">CLIENT: Looking for something. Right. Because I know that if I want to help out with this, I have to say something, but I\u2019m just dreading it, because I know that I have to figure it out on my own and that, you know, I don\u2019t really have anybody to back me up. Like, I don\u2019t have my mom sitting down with <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F1\">my dad and me saying, listen, Christopher. We\u2019ve got to get this rolling. Or Michael being like, as the grandchildren, we want to help with this. And it\u2019s just really just me. And, you know, it\u2019s just \u2013 again, it just feels like more of the same. It\u2019s been so long in this whole thing, I feel like since <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F2\">(inaudible at 40:32) you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A1\">And I think that some of this also is, you know, he wasn\u2019t good for everything, but he was good for this kind of thing. He would sit there, you know, even if he had no suggestions or no way of being involved, he would sit there with me and help me figure out how to address this and help me research <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A11\">facilities and help me, you know, figure \u2013 exactly.[40:54] Just \u2013 it\u2019s just more feeling alone. Stephanie was getting out of my car last night and she\u2019s like, oh, I don\u2019t want to go in. I hate waking up alone. And I just want to fucking kick her out of the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A5\">CLIENT: I was like, tell me about it. You know. And then I had to go to my mom\u2019s house, because I had a coupon for this online pet supply Web site. And it\u2019s like, a huge bag of \u2013 and I didn\u2019t realize the bag of food I got was so big and I have nowhere to put it in the house with the cats and like, they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A51\">going to get into it and then this huge thing of litter. I was like, argh. I\u2019m sick of doing this all alone. I\u2019m sick of doing all this stuff alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562326\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A7\">THERAPIST: We have to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A9\">CLIENT: Okay.
