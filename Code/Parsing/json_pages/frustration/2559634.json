(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: (sigh) Whew! So, yeah. It\u2019s been a busy couple of weeks, to say the least. Soccer started, so that was good, good to get back to practice and get after it. Also, my old\u2026 actually going after this, I\u2019m going back to Google to talk to my old manager; she wants to hire me back in the role that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I should have been in before I left, so\u2026 That\u2019s actually really exciting for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Is that part of the reason that you left? You weren\u2019t happy with (blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, well the way that it worked was, I had run our team for like six months while she had some family stuff she had to deal with. So I just, you know, I took the reins and ran her team as the lead and was essentially the manager of this team. The expectation that I had from her boss was that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">when there was\u2026 the reason I was doing that was not just because I\u2019m a good guy, but so it would give, you know, give me the preparation necessary for when the next lead position opened and that would be mine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And then they didn\u2019t do that. They promoted somebody else. Then they had the nerve to ask me to work for that person. And I said, \u201cNo. That won\u2019t be happening at all.\u201d So that was one of the big reasons behind me leaving. Now after eight months, they\u2019ve come full circle and realized that maybe they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">did bet on the wrong horse and that, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So I started negotiations, and I don\u2019t want to get too excited, but I think that, she was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been fighting for this for eight months and\u2026\u201d her boss is like now finally asking, like \u201cOkay, when\u2019s he coming back?\u201d Like, so it\u2019s gotten, I guess, kind of serious, without me having to do anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">which was exciting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So, we\u2019ll obviously see what happens. Talk is cheap, when I have an offer letter in front of me, then I can kind of feel really good about it, but um\u2026 Yeah, so that\u2019s really exciting, because I think, in terms of my career goals, this has been a bit of a lateral step, the role I\u2019m in right now. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">their intent to tease me, you know, as long as they can to keep me doing my job, because I want to be doing something different from what I\u2019m doing, and they know this, and I\u2019ve said it, I mean I\u2019ve been very open with it. I said, \u201cLook, from Day One, this is how I view my trajectory at this company, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">right? I\u2019m going to come in and I\u2019ll learn about the product and I\u2019ll do this one job and then, when I\u2019m ready, you know, and I feel like (inaudible 00:02:50) I ought come over here and start doing this other stuff, you know? And help instead of working with cost numbers and getting them up and running, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">I\u2019d rather build product\u2026right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">It\u2019s a very, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an unnatural transition. It\u2019s not like going from being a chef to being an astrophysicist or something. There is a lot of similarity between the two roles, and what I\u2019ve come to realize is they are willing to say whatever it takes to keep me happy, but they\u2019re not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">willing to commit to doing anything that they say they want to do. I have acted in good faith and towards a number of projects, well, it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, we just need to see this project, just to make sure that you can, you know, that you can do it.\u201d And then it\u2019s like I do it, and I knock it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">out of the park, and it\u2019s stuff that customers are raving about, and they go, \u201cWell, you know, just do this other project.\u201d And like bits and pieces of the role that I want, but not the role that I want. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">I didn\u2019t think much of this at first, because there is some amount of vetting period, but then when I talked to my peers, who were all also promised, you know, this opportunity to grow into other roles, it\u2019s been the same story for them, too. Where it\u2019s been\u2026 one of the guys has been there for three <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">years, and it\u2019s always, \u201cWell, just do this one more thing, and we\u2019ll check to see if you\u2019re, you know, good enough to do that thing.\u201d And at some point, you kind of go, \u201cAll right, maybe this isn\u2019t just me, maybe this is a systemic thing,\u201d and, you know, maybe this is a company that\u2019s willing to just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">say whatever they have to do keep you, you know, to keep you happy enough not to leave, but not sort of doing that job that they want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">It came home to me, that they were probably going in a different direction when, in the initial conversations I had had, the whole idea was they would hire somebody, you know, with lots of experience to do that role, you know, 25-30 years, like a vice president or a president-level person to run, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">know, that sort of function. And I was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s great!\u201d You know, that\u2019s somebody that, in my mind, it made a lot of sense, like that\u2019s the right person, who can really shape this direction and at some point, I could transition over into that role and learn a lot from this person and I\u2019d grow <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">and I\u2019m mentored, and I was like, \u201cYes! Like, I agree with that!\u201d And then they hired someone with seven years of experience! When I have five, without even affording me the opportunity to interview for the role.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">You know, the company line on that was, \u201cWell, your work is so good, where you are right now, we don\u2019t want to move that, and it\u2019s much harder to hire people to do what you do versus what you want to do,\u201d and it felt to me like they were blowing a bunch of smoke over my a**, in all honesty. And that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">fine, and I\u2019ve dealt with that. But I see it now more and more, now that I\u2019ve sort of taken these tasks and just knocking them out of the park, while also totally doing a great job in my other job. So it\u2019s like, okay, at some point, there are got to be, you know, we have to do this. I\u2019ve acted in good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">faith, so let\u2019s see your end. And I realize that, that other piece of their deal is not going to be held up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">So, I think it\u2019s a good opportunity to at least explore. And I can even use it as leverage here to say, \u201cHey, Google wants to bring me back to do all of these things that I\u2019ve been telling you I\u2019ve wanted to do for eight months. And I\u2019ve been very honest with them, and I\u2019ve said, \u201cLook, I want to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">this job. It\u2019s my career. What I\u2019m doing right now is a job, the career is over here. And you need to help me build towards that, because that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m supposed to be able to have this flexibility as a small company to do lots of different things. And if that\u2019s happening, I\u2019m going to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">elsewhere to, kind of do my career. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">And they\u2019ll be, \u201cYeah, yeah, no we totally get that. You know, it\u2019s fine and you know, when you\u2019re ready, just keep the dialog open.\u201d So now maybe this is the opportunity to say, \u201cHey, this is what I have on offer. Certainly, I deal from all of these characteristics, can we make that happen here? If <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">not, then I\u2019m on my way out the door.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">The tricky part from their standpoint, they\u2019ve always tried to play the money angle with me. But, I mean, it\u2019s not about the money. Like, if it was about the money, I would 100% go back to Google, because my salary would, you know, increase by 60% plus at Google! So when they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re potentially <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">forfeiting this big lump sum,\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cThat\u2019s very, potentially very real money that I could forfeit if I walk away from equity; but it\u2019s never been about the equity. It\u2019s never been about the money, it\u2019s always been about the experience and the opportunity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">And I think that the type of person they are used to attracting is coming from another start-up where, \u201cOh yeah, of course, you know, I\u2019m only going to, you know, (use this software in an evening ph?), you know, maybe, I don\u2019t know, 80 grand, let\u2019s say. Whereas if you\u2019re at Google, you make a 180 grand. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">(inaudible at 00:07:28) less than that, I made less than that at Google, but it\u2019s never been about the money, you know? Because if it was, I would have just stayed at Google and been blessed happy, but made, you know, less significant salary versus what I make right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">So, that\u2019s been\u2026 it\u2019s nice to feel like I have got some cards to play. In the past, it\u2019s been like I don\u2019t really have any leverage, you know? I didn\u2019t have offers from other companies, or really great, you know, people who are ready to take me on into their new start-up or anything like they\u2019ll make <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">me co-founder and I certainly don\u2019t have anything like that going on (in my head ph?) right now, so\u2026 It\u2019s nice to feel like I have a little bit of leverage to maybe level the playing field, so it\u2019s not all just one-sided. So that\u2019s, that was nice. And then we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll obviously see what happens <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">with Google. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like now you feel like you have more power, negotiating power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s part of what it comes down to, it\u2019s a very, it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2019 know what happened. At some point, at Google, someone gave me the advice that you have to make your own career, like no one is going to help you do it. So no one is like looking out for your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">best interests unless you are. And I internalized it, and I\u2019ve always been sort of working towards fitting together pieces together that I think will help. I don\u2019t know where I am, Doctor. I don\u2019t know what the end looks like, and I\u2019m okay with that. But I\u2019m content at this point to pull together experiences <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">that will continue to grow me, you know, so I can move sort of higher up the organization, but also give me broader and broader perspective. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">And, you know, as part of that, you mentioned like power and leverage and negotiation, it\u2019s super true; and this company, you know, is no different than any other big company. It feels like, I feel like there are a lot people who\u2019ve tried to build these little empires, you know? At Google, it\u2019d be a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">30-person, but here it\u2019s 3. (inaudible at 00:09:24), you know, we\u2019re a small company that acts like a big company. I love it, it\u2019s just a lot of politics and processes and bureaucracy that are\u2026 not necessarily inhibit our ability to do the right thing, but certainly make it more work than it need be. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">That doesn\u2019t feel too too much like a small company, especially now that we\u2019ve gone over 50 people. It\u2019s very different. I started it with the 26th person, whereas we\u2019ve doubled since January.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">But even, you know, even in that world, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to play these games and leverage is a super helpful thing, you know? So, if I was like, \u201cHey, I have this offer from Facebook,\u201d I imagine that I\u2019d be able to do whatever job I wanted. Or I\u2019d have to go to Facebook, which would not be the worst <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">thing in the world. So, it\u2019s like, without that, there are no counter-balance, \u201cHey this is what I want to do.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice. Lots of people have career aspirations, good luck, (tell them then ph? 00:10:08). Here, if you\u2019re good, maybe you can hope to do this in the future.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">So it\u2019s nice to have that and it will be good because it will force them to show some more of their cards. Like, are you guys actually serious about this, or are you just, you know, just kind of jerking me around? And obviously they\u2019ll never be totally up front about that, but it will be good to at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">least have that to sort of check against the whole song and dance that I\u2019ve gotten so far. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">And then, I guess on, you know, in terms of like relationship stuff, like Melanie and I, it\u2019s been, I mean, I think it\u2019s been a little bumpy, which is to be expected. We\u2019ve had an incredible lot of drama in the past and certainly both have faults, sometimes she more than I and sometimes I am certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">am responsible for a lot of it and she\u2019s not. But I feel that, you know, I feel like we\u2019re moving in a direction where our communication is certainly more open and we can talk about, like, the bad things and it\u2019s kind of okay. Like, she\u2019s just\u2026 something, you know, she was feeling really uncomfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">about us and she\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know. You know, we\u2019ve done this so many times, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work this time.\u201d And like, it was just a really real conversation, whereas before, I don\u2019t know if we would have been able to have that. Like, I don\u2019t know if I would have been able <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B3\">to listen to that, or if she would have been able to say that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">So, it\u2019s um\u2026 that feels, it feels better to be able to have a discussion about something that\u2019s uncomfortable versus, you know, sort of trying to have it all be rosy and then it\u2019s not, at all. And like she even mentioned, she was like, her birthday was in the summer, at the beginning of the summer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">She was like, you know, for my birthday, (let\u2019s all ph? 00:11:54), that\u2019s like posting stuff on Facebook and it was like we\u2019re big and this really happy couple, and it\u2019s like, we weren\u2019t. It was like, yeah, I know! (chuckles) And she was like, well, I couldn\u2019t, like, she couldn\u2019t\u2026she couldn\u2019t not project <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">that, because it was like there is something on her, and that just didn\u2019t, wasn\u2019t, you know, she felt the need that if she just faked it, eventually we would get there. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">And I think now we\u2019re just able to be maybe a little bit more real with each other. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because time has passed or if because we\u2019ve both kind of had that realization, but it\u2019s nice to be a little bit more real about it. And it\u2019s sort of saying, \u201cYeah, there are going to be ups and downs <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">and false starts and\u2026\u201d You know, at some point, we\u2019ll step back and say, \u201cHey, is this actually working? You know, do you feel like this is a thing that\u2019s going in a good direction or is it something where it\u2019s not,\u201d you know? I guess we\u2019ve been through enough where it\u2019s kind of comfortable to say that; <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F2\">it\u2019s much more uncomfortable to say it with somebody, you know, you just met her, you\u2019ve only been dating for little while. But we\u2019ve been through this for, you know, a while, so\u2026 It feels, it\u2019s refreshing to be able to deal with that, that type of dialog. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">THERAPIST: What parts of it have been bumpy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">CLIENT: Well I think, I mean, I think just the fact that we\u2019ve gone through so much, right? We\u2019ve broken up a couple of times, I\u2019ve cheated on her, she\u2019s weaponized her past against me, kind of, all of that. It feels like we\u2019re a little past it now. I\u2019m not sure\u2026why. You know, maybe I\u2019m at the point <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200431\">now where I\u2019m just, I\u2019m comfortable with that, but I also told her, like, don\u2019t ever do that to me again, like don\u2019t try to use that against me, because I can use things against you. Like, I don\u2019t want to have to do that. I know that\u2019s where I would go, if it came to it, and I\u2019d rather not. And I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200432\">she\u2019s better about, she\u2019s more cognizant about it, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">I was in a nine-year relationship that I\u2019d been out of for six months when I met her. Prior to that, I was in high school. So that\u2019s very different from her, who had spent the years from, let\u2019s say, 18-31, longest relationship total, like relationship time combined, was 2 \u00bd years. So there are going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">to be some differences in experience there, and you know, her using that against me is not fair; but me also using, you know, me also feeling uncomfortable with that, I understand why she would feel strange, why it would be weird for her that I would be uncomfortable with that, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">You\u2019re casually been dating for ten years, I\u2019ve casually been dating for six months. I\u2019ve been in a relationship for nine years, you haven\u2019t. So there are sort of these two different worlds that are not necessarily colliding, but\u2026 And it takes a while to kind of figure out and see how it\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">fit. I think we\u2019re at the point now, where I feel more cognizant of it and I feel like she feels more cognizant of it. So we can kind of either avoid these things or, you know, at least talk through it with a little bit more of a level head instead of it being this, like, \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019ve never <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200472\">done this?\u201d Or, \u201cWell, oh, you\u2019ve had sex with that many guys? My God! Why did you tell me that?\u201d You know, like, stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">I think we\u2019re both a little bit more\u2026 and it\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re checking ourselves, but it\u2019s like, that respectful partnership that you want to have, you know, is not always about telling the brutal, honest truth all of the time. It\u2019s knowing when to say, what to say, how to deliver it. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">there is more of that going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like she used to tell you things to be hurtful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think she did it\u2026 I think that was the consequence of what she did. I don\u2019t think she did it deliberately. I do believe that she\u2019s not that type of person. But I think the way that it would be in some regards, I think it was her, you know, hurt defense mechanism almost against getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004D1\">into a relationship, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F\">Like, what do I know? I know how to do relationships. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, you know, nine years. You kind of get good at that. Dating? I don\u2019t know how to date! I wouldn\u2019t know how to date, I\u2019ll probably never know how to date. I missed a very formative period in my life, you\u2019re only in your 20s once! <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004F1\">And that\u2019s fine, right? I mean\u2026 Yeah, there\u2019s parts of it that were probably awesome for some people, but there are also probably a lot of shitty parts. I had a lot of awesome parts, a lot of shitty parts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">So the fact that she would, you know, she could never consider that, she never considered like, \u201cHey, I haven\u2019t had sex with a quarter of the people that you have, and like, no, I\u2019ve never had sex with somebody in like the bathroom of a club,\u201d you know? Like, stuff that she just assumes are sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">normal (inaudible 00:16:36, this is like, wasn\u2019t the cape tournament ph?). And I don\u2019t think she realized how hurtful those things would be, because it wasn\u2019t like it would be necessarily deliberately (organized ph?), but certainly felt like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">So I think we got to a better place in that regard. And that\u2019s not even, it\u2019s like a microcosm of other issues, right? Like, my interpretation of things, her intentions with things, we\u2019d go like this, and then we never really talk about it, so it would end up being like\u2026 At some point in the future, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">this disconnect would end up being big drama, you know? Instead, it\u2019s a little, yeah, it\u2019s painful, like the threesome thing I told you about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">I was like, you know, we were talking it about it today. She was like, \u201cIs it something that makes you uncomfortable?\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, yeah, it does make me feel uncomfortable because you, like you have no reason to tell me that. There was not, no conceivable thing in my mind, there are no scenario <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">I can walk through, if I try to empathize with you, where telling me that is anything other than a terrible, bitchy, like horrible thing to do.\u201d Like, I understand that you were excited, and I understand why you did it, and I certainly don\u2019t fault you for doing it, sounds like you had a good time, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200552\">safe, respectful, all that. But, like, what the fuck! Like, really? You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">So, and I think that she, after hearing me say that, she was like, \u201cWow, yeah!\u201d You know? And I just feel like it\u2019s\u2026 she gets that now more and now she\u2019ll mention it from time to time, it\u2019s like, look, just don\u2019t. Like, it\u2019s not, like I don\u2019t want to hear about that. Like I\u2019m not talking about what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">happened with me. Well we were a part of it, like you and I did that, you\u2019ll never know any of that because it\u2019s\u2026 what possible good could come of it? Like, there is nothing, there is nothing build on there. And maybe there is a point in time in the future where it\u2019s critical for you to know, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200572\">just, I don\u2019t ever see that. And I think that having, you know, having said that and considering what had happened before, you can understand why I wouldn\u2019t really be comfortable with hearing about your sexual escapades that happened while we were apart. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20059\">And she kind had like that\u2026 you know, you see when people kind of \u201cget\u201d things? I mean, you probably see this a lot, because it\u2019s what you do. You know when they have that \u201cAha!\u201d moment, you go like\u2026 like, she was kind of like looking at me and like kind of giving me a cross look, and then she\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200591\">\u201cOhhhh.\u201d Like, it really hit her, and she was like, \u201cI\u2019m really, really like\u2026\u201d It felt like a very authentic apology. So either she\u2019s like the greatest liar in the world that I\u2019ve happened to know for over a year or she\u2019s really actually sorry about that. So that felt, felt like a little bit of closure <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200592\">there, around that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B\">And then it felt, I mean, it felt good. Like, we didn\u2019t, we don\u2019t really\u2026 we\u2019re trying to kind of ease back into it, which is tricky because we\u2019re both like, when we\u2019re together, like we\u2019re, really, really together and when we\u2019re apart, there are always like this, \u201cI\u2019m lonely.\u201d We\u2019re really good friends, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B1\">which happened after we started dating. It was strange. So it\u2019s like tough, because it\u2019s like you\u2019re finding you want to talk to your friend, and she\u2019s like good friend, maybe my best friend. You want to spend time with them, and kind of do everything. We\u2019re sort of, we\u2019re really easing back into it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B2\">because we want to make sure\u2026 you know, look, there are a lot of people who have seen us get together and break up a bunch of times. And it kind of, you know, you deal with eye rolls and stuff, and it gets more difficult every time you try to\u2026 \u201cOkay, hey look, this is my girlfriend Melanie, you may <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B3\">remember her from my past girlfriend experiences two months ago, eight months ago, etc.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">So it\u2019s better, I feel it gets better for us to kind of go through this and see how we feel about each other for a couple of months before we go out and start being a thing for other people to see. Like, yeah, sure, if you want to have friends over or whatever, it\u2019s not a problem, but it\u2019s not like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D1\">I\u2019m going to go and be like, \u201cHey, Mom and Dad! I\u2019m like dating Melanie again! For the nth time!\u201d And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to start hanging out with her\u2026 her parents live in Concord, she lives in Falmouth, so we used to see them quite a bit. So like, we\u2019re able to do that. You know, we\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D2\">to ease back into things and kind of be a little bit more cognizant of like, hey where are we at? Like, let\u2019s check in on this, like let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re kind of doing okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">Which I think is different, because in the past, what would happen is we\u2019d get back together and it would be like, boom! We\u2019re back together, we\u2019re a thing. And it\u2019s like, kind on this rocket trajectory, and then there is one little thing that goes, and then the rocket crashes. There is no\u2026 you\u2019ll never <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F1\">get to that destination, because we never took the time up front to sort of step back and kind of walk through the \u201clet\u2019s make sure we\u2019re in a good spot,\u201d kind of check in with this before we start to bring more and more people in. Which actually, come to think of it\u2026 that whole, without ever really <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F2\">thinking and making sure we\u2019re on the same page and talking about it up front, puts her probably in a position where she feels the need to broadcast as it were, okay, because we\u2019ve brought all these people into it. So it\u2019s not like you want to bring all these people into it, and talk about how shitty <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F3\">your relationship is, you know? You want to bring these people in, they\u2019ll be like, \u201cYeah, this is awesome, like this is a really good thing.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20061\">THERAPIST: Is that something that you expect?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20065\">THERAPIST: Is that something she has expressed to you or to other people or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20067\">CLIENT: The what? That we\u2019re\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20069\">THERAPIST: Awesome!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, no that was an outward thing, right? She\u2019s, so she\u2019s like, I describe her as like 13-year old girl on Facebook, so she likes to do the whole, like, \u201cThis is how awesome, this is the awesome thing that I\u2019m doing on Facebook\u201d kind of thing. So I think that it\u2019s important for her, especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B1\">because she\u2019s like, she\u2019s older than a lot of her friends and she\u2019s super cognizant of her age and like how like how she\u2019s been single for like ever! And so she\u2019s like super cognizant of that, so she wants to show people, like, \u201cYeah, look, I can do it. I can pull it together, and like I\u2019ve been really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B2\">good. I\u2019ve been with somebody good, and it\u2019s really good.\u201d And I think it\u2019s tricky because that mental model breaks down when it breaks down between us. And the more people that you bring in and the more people that you put on this fa\u00e7ade for, the more pressure you\u2019re under to make it succeed. And when <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B3\">you\u2019re under a lot of pressure to do something, you know, you squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and then it actually it pops, it doesn\u2019t finally help it be any more successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D\">THERAPIST: So she feels insecure? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F\">CLIENT: A little\u2026 I think, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that she feels\u2026 maybe insecure, I don\u2019t know the way to put it. The way that she\u2019s put it to me is that she\u2019s always felt incredibly unlovable, and when she\u2019s with me, she feels like she\u2019s lovable, like she is, as an individual, capable of being loved. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F1\">know, and there is, I mean, obviously lots of things that you could go into about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20071\">I think that that\u2019s like part of the reason why we feel really good together, because like, when I\u2019m with her, I feel really good. Like, I feel really good about myself, I feel like, \u201cYeah, this is somebody who I could spend a lot of time with and have a lot of fun.\u201d I mean we talk like\u2026 I mean people <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200711\">come in here and just talk to you, well like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">I\u2019m pretty social and I\u2019m pretty chatty. The first, I mean, so the, I met her actually in a bar, in like\u2026 I met her like 10:00, and I think we talked until like 4:00 in the morning, like just about whatever! This has never happened to another person, and since then, we\u2019ve really never shut it up to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200731\">each other. Like, we can\u2019t\u2026 like, she\u2026 you know, she has like a Gmail address, I have a Gmail address, so we can, you know, Google Chat with each other. Like we\u2019ve both agreed that we can\u2019t do that, well, because we won\u2019t get anything done, you know? We\u2019re just shoot the shit about whatever! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">Which I think is, you know, in terms of like characteristics that are important, I\u2019m like, yes, being attractive and like, being smart, being funny and laughing at my jokes all really important things. If I can talk to you for hours on end? That\u2019s really, really helpful! Like that helps in a relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200751\">a lot, and my last serious girlfriend, you know the one (with the friend inaudible 00:23:55), it was like, that started to break down. Like it was just not\u2026 we couldn\u2019t connect on anything anymore. It\u2019s not even like we could talk through stuff, it was just kind of like, she was very quiet and reserved. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200752\">So it wasn\u2019t even like we could communicate through issues, it was just, \u201cEverything okay?\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cYou sure?\u201d \u201cYup, fine.\u201d \u201cYou sure?\u201d \u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Makes it tough, tough to get through stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20077\">So like, to me, that\u2019s super important, and I think that those pieces, when put together, is part of why it feels like really good. But I do think the risk is like what I was saying before, you know, you just get out there, and you get too far in too quickly, and you can\u2019t pull yourself out. And in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200771\">her mind, she\u2019s got, you know, she\u2019s dealing with probably like the dread \u201cought of.\u201d Well, I have to do this, I have to keep this up because I feel really loved, and he\u2019s a whole new person, I will, make me feel loved because I\u2019ve never felt like this before, and I\u2019m older, so this is like my last <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200772\">chance, and like\u2026 and that\u2019s, ehhhhh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t agree with all that, you know, I don\u2019t understand why she would feel that way. I don\u2019t feel that way, like, I\u2019m with her because I want to be with her, she makes me happy. It seems like there is a really good future there, but I\u2019m not with <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200773\">her because I, I\u2019m not with her\u2026 I\u2019m with her, because I want to be with her, not because I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t get anybody else, or because no one else will make me feel that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20079\">Like, I think that every person that you\u2019re with, like every relationship you\u2019re with probably feels a little bit different, there is like no \u201cone size fits all\u201d model for this is good and this is bad in terms of how you feel. It certainly, I\u2019ve had, you know, people that I\u2019ve gone out on dates with <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200791\">before, it\u2019s felt really good, but it\u2019s just, it\u2019s not the same, you know, it\u2019s very different. And I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s had enough of those types of experiences, you know, even though she dated casually for a while, it sounds like that was more on the physical side of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B\">I never did that, so it\u2019s not, I mean, until relatively recently, that was not a thing that I would even like think I\u2019d be able to do. But you know, it\u2019s something where I feel a little bit less pressure, (I guess ph? inaudible at 00:26:04). And that probably had something to do with both the fact that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B1\">she\u2019s a woman, so she\u2019s got a biological clock that\u2019s ticking, the fact that she\u2019s older and the fact that I\u2019m, you know, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m 4 years younger than her, so. And I think it\u2019s easier for men, it\u2019s easier for men to date younger women than the inverse, so I think for her, it\u2019s probably, there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B2\">something in the back of her mind that\u2019s like, \u201cI need to meet someone.\u201d You know, if she needs to meet somebody her age, it\u2019s going to be tricky because they\u2019re probably going to have kids or been divorced, like she can\u2019t, kind of go through that and do experience with them for the first time. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B3\">going to be, yeah, he\u2019s getting married again, you know, or he\u2019s having another kid. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007D\">I think that\u2019s one of the things that, for her, and for us both independently, I think that\u2019s important, like I\u2019d like to share new experiences with new people, you know? There is some stuff that I just like to do, but, you know, sharing these new experiences has been really fun and like continuing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2007D1\">to do that I think is important for the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007F\">So back to what you said, \u201cDoes she feel insecure about it?\u201d I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s insecure or unlovable or something like that, but it\u2019s something, you know, it\u2019s something in there, there are a spectrum of insecurity, there is certainly something. And I think, yeah, I think part of that probably goes <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2007F1\">back to\u2026 I had a good childhood, you know, it\u2019s just that my mother just kind went off the rails a little bit later on. You know, my mom\u2026 like I felt all love as a kid. Like I always felt like super supported, could do kind of anything, you know, had just an infinite well of support from whatever it <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2007F2\">was, you know, that I wanted to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20081\">And that kind of got me through trials, then I went into college, I think that\u2019s part of why I feel like really generally confident about, like, myself and, you know, even being cognizant of myself and self-awareness and I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I need therapy!\u201d That\u2019s okay. No fault of anyone, you know, something <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200811\">I have to do. I don\u2019t\u2019 know if she ever had that. Like, I don\u2019t think she looks at her parents as like this infinite well of support and people who have always sort of just been like, \u201cYeah, just go do it,\u201d or anything like that. And I think that that\u2019s part of where that like, unlovable feeling comes from. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20083\">(brief pause) Yeah, I think, um\u2026 I think the other part about it is, I don\u2019t think there was\u2026 you know, I think that I\u2019m pretty unique in where I am, you know, at this point in my life. Like, I think, within a little bubble of, like, people who end up working at jobs at start-ups and companies like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200831\">Google and all that, like, I\u2019m pretty, you know, average, right? Like, go to college, go work at Google, pay off your student loans, like do lots of crazy things, and you travel and do all those things. But I realized that, for like the normal 20-year old, I think I might have made this comment to you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200832\">at some point, like, at 24, you\u2019re supposed to be going to rehab and your parents are supposed to be paying for that, (or the inverse ph? 00:28:57), you know? Whereas, I was able to handle all of that because I was lucky, a good et cetera, to end up working at Google. So I\u2019ve done a bunch with my life, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200833\">and I think that that\u2026 is as awesome that I\u2019ve had that opportunity, but I think for her, you know, she sees that as not, \u201cI\u2019ve hit some peak somewhere,\u201d but that\u2019s as a sign of \u201cThere is even more to come.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20085\">And I think that that\u2019s something that, for her, may not having had that, is, that\u2019s also incredibly appealing to her, to have opportunity to be, like, a part of that, to be a partner in that and to help, you know, plan adventures and do things. I think that that\u2019s also appealing to her. You know, because, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200851\">I don\u2019t get the sense of\u2026 (pause) I actually don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know about that. (pause) It\u2019s funny, because her, like life and college was so different from mine. She was like, she called her parents, and she was like, \u201cI want to go on spring break, can I borrow like $1800?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200852\">sure, no problem.\u201d I don\u2019t think I ever borrowed $1800 from parents in my life, like ever! My parents couldn\u2019t like fork over $1800! You know, I think that she has a very different appreciation towards money than I do, yeah, she definitely has no appreciation\u2026 which is cool, because she doesn\u2019t make <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200853\">a lot of it, so it\u2019s not (chuckles) it\u2019s not a big deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20087\">THERAPIST: What does she do for work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20089\">CLIENT: She\u2019s a teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Oh, I think you mentioned that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, she\u2019s a teacher over at Cheshire. Yeah, but, you know, that, I mean it\u2019s not bad compensation for like, a teacher, but in the scheme of life software engineer, lawyer, anesthetician (corrects) anesthesiologist (chuckles)\u2026 I mean maybe, they\u2019re probably anestheticians to the stars that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2008D1\">are incredibly wealthy, too! And so it\u2019s like, I think that\u2019s also\u2026 I think ultimately, like as I\u2019m talking, because I realize that we\u2019re really good complements for each other. Like, we have enough stuff in the middle of the Venn diagram, you know, enough overlap that, like really important, like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2008D2\">compatibility, it\u2019s not like they want to talk (inaudible). But there is enough different, where we can still learn from each other. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2008F\">Like you can imagine, as a teacher, she\u2019s a little bit more empathic than I am, and she\u2019s a little bit like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say \u201cbetter with people,\u201d she\u2019s not better with people, but she\u2019s\u2026 like my default response with people, like women, is to be flirty. And if that doesn\u2019t work, I don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2008F1\">know what\u2019s, I don\u2019t have another mode operation, because it generally works. But like she\u2019s got like different strategies for talking to people and all that, so there are like, that\u2019s one part of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20091\">She\u2019s like, she\u2019s a good grounding force for me, because, like, you kind of nailed this a little bit when we were talking. You\u2019re like, \u201cThat seems like you\u2019re just kind of looking for something and you don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d and it\u2019s like, well that\u2019s, yeah, that\u2019s pretty accurate. She helps\u2026 she <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200911\">doesn\u2019t try to rein that in, you know, because she knows that that would be a lost cause. But more, you know, it\u2019s not about trying to find out, you know, where home is; you can kind of, with her, it feels like anywhere could be home. So it\u2019s like she can ground me a little bit in that regard, which\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200912\">I don\u2019t want to say it like, \u201ccurtails the wanderlust\u201d or whatever, but, it certainly makes me feel less\u2026 it makes staying in one place for a while feel less bad and more accepted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20093\">But, it\u2019s never like she\u2019d be the type that would try to not, you know, try to stop me from like, going on vacation or something like that. Or she\u2019d probably want to be part of it, you know? Oh, hey\u2026like of the guys I play soccer with, he\u2019s got to go back to Mali for three years in a couple of months <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200931\">and I was like, \u201cYeah? Mali?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, sure! Come visit! He was like, we\u2019ll go swim with sharks and go hunting and see lions and stuff.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYes, a thousand percent yes! I will be, love to do that!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20095\">She would never stop that; she would also kind of want to tag along. But I think for her, and this is what she rubs off on me, is that it\u2019s okay to do that, you know, but you kind of have to have somewhere to put your head that you call home. And I think that that, with her, feels a little bit more <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200951\">natural than it would maybe by myself. If it, when I\u2019m by myself, I\u2019m more prone to just be like, ehhh, a little more transient. Like, yeah, yeah, doesn\u2019t really matter if I stay in Boston. You know, I could go ply my wares in [], who knows? The possibilities are\u2026 like, with her, it\u2019s like, it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200952\">like a ground to me a little bit, but it\u2019s also (I get to Australia ph? 00:33:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20097\">Like, you know, (I don\u2019t ph?) actually think I\u2019d want to live in Europe. I mean I could, certainly. But not really going to do everything for me. You know, it would be fun for a little while, and I get bored, and then I need to move on somewhere else, and that\u2019s not\u2026 you know, for me, that doesn\u2019t help <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200971\">me kind of ground myself and really spend time thinking about what it is I\u2019m looking for because it\u2019s about\u2026 and that point the journey becomes a means, the journey becomes an end unto itself instead of a means to an end. Seems like there\u2019s a Led Zeppelin there somewhere in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20099\">You know, which is think what I would be prone to do unchecked, right? It would be adventuring for the sake of adventure, instead of trying to get something, trying to clear my head, trying to, whatever it would be. So I guess in that regard, when I say she\u2019s a grounding function, I guess that\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200991\">of what I mean, like it\u2026 helps me. That\u2019s probably the right words. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2009B\">THERAPIST: When I think of grounding, I think of an electrical charge. You ground an electrical charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2009F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not the only meaning of grounding, but that\u2019s a huge (inaudible) into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that could also be true, because it is\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I think, maybe, anchor is probably the right\u2026 You know, because I think about like a blimp, right? A blimp can kind of go wherever it wants to go and it will take a little time to get there, but it will get there. But like, eventually <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200A11\">you don\u2019t want the blimp to float away, right? You want to kind of have it\u2026 grounded, but yeah, anchored, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200A3\">Because that, and like, I think that there are some part of that that feels like really good, like\u2026 And I think now I\u2019m just, maybe I\u2019m more cognizant of it, but like I\u2019m seeing people that are my age, like in\u2026 and not just people who\u2019ve been dating for a long time or married and have kids, because\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200A31\">whatever; they\u2019ve been doing that for, you know, ten years. But seeing people my age who are like, Yeah, they live with their girlfriend and like, Yeah, they\u2019re engaged or Yeah, they have a house, they like\u2026 I think part of it is me\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say, this is going to sound weird when I say it, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200A32\">like, in somewhere in the back of my brain, there are like this (imprudent ph?) notion of like the family structure and like, you do this and then you do this and then you do this and this, and then it\u2019s like, you know what? It\u2019s actually okay if I own a place and she lives with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200A5\">It\u2019s not like the first place that we live in together needs to be a place we both bought or if it\u2019s a place that we both rent, like\u2026 that\u2019s okay. And I\u2019ve seen different variations on that, like it\u2019s, \u201cYes, it\u2019s okay to be engaged and not live together.\u201d Like, there are all these different, it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200A51\">like a \u201cone size fits all\u201d model. And I think for long time, that\u2019s just how it\u2019s been in my head. Right, like you date, and then eventually you move in, and eventually you get engaged, and then you get married, and then maybe buy a place together and then you have babies, and then like, kind of, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200A52\">(vocal ticking sound), but it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200A7\">Like you can be engaged, though apart. You can be engaged and live together in an apartment. You can be engaged and live in one of or the other\u2019s condos. Like it\u2019s not\u2026 and I think that seeing that and like\u2026 maybe if not, that it\u2026 it\u2019s probably always been there, but like being more cognizant of it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200A71\">it\u2019s kind of nice. Because it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not just, \u201cThis is the way things have to go in our relationship.\u201d Like there is a next step for us to take, you know? That first next step is probably for us to kind of start to re-integrate the friend group, and that happens in a couple of months. But then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200A72\">you know, after that, it\u2019s\u2026 what is it? You know, maybe I\u2019ll have a condo by then, like maybe she\u2019ll have a condo by then. Maybe it\u2019s another thing, like, maybe we just move in together and see if that works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200A9\">It\u2019s not like it has to be \u201cA to B to C to D to E to F,\u201d and we\u2019re done! It\u2019s kind of, there are different next steps that we could take, and I think as long as we\u2019re on the same page of a lot of it, it\u2019s okay to be maybe engaged and living apart, or living together in my condo, or living together in <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200A91\">her condo or, you know, just sharing places and (drafting ph?) it out, you know, sharing a place and like renting together. And that feels\u2026 good, feels nice to know that it\u2019s not like there is, \u201cThis is the way.\u201d It\u2019s not that way at this point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200AB\">(brief pause) Yeah, and I think\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say that ever felt like a big issue before, but it\u2019s good to know that there are different approaches to the whole thing. I think one of the other things is, too, like we\u2019ve got a lot of weird inside jokes about everything that\u2019s happened between us, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200AB1\">like\u2026 Like she, at one point, was having an affair, but there was a married man having an affair with her, you know, she knows I slept with that married woman when I was in Vegas, so it\u2019s like\u2026 it\u2019s just, it\u2019s funny because she\u2019ll call me a motherfucker and I\u2019ll be like, \u201cYeah.\u201d And she\u2019ll be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200AB2\">\u201cYeah, I know!\u201d And like, but like it\u2019s a joke, like\u2026 And there is a point, it\u2019s I\u2019m\u2026 we have jokes like that, like we would joke around about one of the girls that I cheated on her with. And then this always sounds really twisted, to explain this to other people, but she somehow it feels okay between <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200AB3\">the two of us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200AD\">And like, you make these jokes in front of other people, and they\u2019re just like, \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d You know, and, but we go, \u201cOh,\u201d like and don\u2019t even explain it, and then you just realize that it\u2019s kind of weird; but like that\u2019s, I think, okay, right? Like, it doesn\u2019t matter really <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200AD1\">what other people think, like, we\u2019re having fun, we\u2019re laughing at the joke, like, just because you don\u2019t get all the inside jokes of our relationship, like, that\u2019s okay. Like I\u2019m sure that every relationship has, you know, their inside jokes and their stories and their things, and that\u2019s, Hey cool, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200AD2\">right? Like, that\u2019s the common language that you begin to share, that taxonomy around experiences and all that. Like, yeah, it may not make sense to you on the outside, but it\u2019s funny for me, it\u2019s funny for her, no one gets hurt, we\u2019ve dealt with me cheating on her\u2026 Sorry it doesn\u2019t make sense to you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200AD3\">but like, that doesn\u2019t make our relationship bad, you know? You don\u2019t have to invalidate us! And then, maybe you do, in your world, and that\u2019s fine, but, it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about us. And I think that that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200AF\">THERAPIST: How would other people know of your inside jokes and kidding? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well, sometimes you make a joke in front of somebody or sometimes you\u2019re explaining it, you know, or you\u2019re explaining like what happened and then it comes up. And then they end up getting like, \u201cWhat do you mean? Like hold on, you joke around about that?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d And I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200B11\">that that\u2026 you know, that in the past probably bothered, I think that bothered both of us, but now it\u2019s like\u2026 You know, these people in our lives that are our friends, and if they can\u2019t handle the fact that we\u2019re, that we\u2019ve done some stupid stuff and now we laugh about it now. Maybe they\u2019re a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200B12\">bit too uptight to be our friends in the first place, so\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200B3\">(brief pause) So I guess otherwise, like, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because I\u2019m more cognizant of it now, but like I\u2019ve been able to drink socially again. Not that it was big problem before, but like, I think the most drinks I\u2019ve had on any given, like social drinking night, was probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200B31\">like two or three, which\u2026 I mean, we\u2019ll see obviously, we\u2019ll see, you know, if there are something bad that happens, we\u2019ll see how long, you know, if I can, kind of stay in control of it. But it feels just like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200B5\">I feel like\u2026 what I\u2019ve actually come to realize is that it\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s the same shit over and over again. Like with my friends, like my soccer friends. It\u2019s like, okay what are we going to do? We\u2019re going to do this, and we\u2019re going to do that, and we\u2019re going to end up at The Field every single <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200B51\">time. And like, either last week or the week before that, I don\u2019t remember which, every time I got asked to go to the bar, I said yes, and I went. And then, like one time, we had practice on Wednesday, and they were like, \u201cOh, you have to come to the bar.\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d And I came, and I had like two iced <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200B52\">teas and I ate dinner, just like a wash. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200B7\">And like I saw, I don\u2019t know, it was like, this is exactly how it would go. Like I was like, was it Jane Goodall, the one with the apes? Yeah, I\u2019m like, in here, I\u2019m like observing this, and I\u2019m like, this is exactly how it goes. You start out and you have like two or three beers, and they go, \u201cAll <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200B71\">right, now we have to go.\u201d And then you go to the bar, and you have like another two or three, and by that point, you\u2019re six beers in. You might as well just keep going. Well, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m watching this happen! And it\u2019s nice, because, it\u2019s like 11:00, I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right, bye guys, I have to get up <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200B72\">and go to the gym in the morning.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re a faggot, you\u2019re this or that.\u201d It\u2019s like, not mad at all, (inaudible at 00:41:35), it\u2019s only Thursday morning, I got to go to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N200B9\">But I get\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what it is about that, but it\u2019s like, that control feels very right. You know, and it feels like I have\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it just feels like it\u2019s not a big deal if I don\u2019t. And it\u2019s coming across as, like I feel like they\u2019re\u2026 they are immature, but it\u2019s not because <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200B91\">they\u2019re immature, it\u2019s because they\u2019re all like three to four years younger than me. (As final for my co-workers is done \/inaud\/ couple of friends 00:42:10 ph?) that 23, 24, it\u2019s the same way. Like, you can\u2019t go out with them, because they hit it hard like every single night they go out and like there <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200B92\">are no night off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N200BB\">That probably works when you\u2019re like a 24-year-old graduate student and you can just kind of work your own hours, but your normal job, like you can\u2019t do that. And it\u2019s also the recovery, it\u2019s just not the same. Like, I\u2019m not going to say I was ever like an epic or prolific drinker, but like, I certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200BB1\">can imagine when I was younger, I would recover from drinking more than I will at 28. You know, so it takes like, if I can go out, and Friday night\u2019s crazy, like, really tough for Saturday night to be crazy because Saturday is spent in recovery. You know, and there are Saturday, Friday and Saturday <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200BB2\">are crazy, Monday is a wash because Sunday is recovery, Monday to recover. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N200BD\">So I think that that\u2026 You know, having that transition, but also feeling okay about it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just moving on with my life and like, kind of getting, like I\u2019m, I feel like I\u2019m almost over it, in a weird way. Like I\u2019m just done with, like, going to the bar, you know\u2026 every Friday night, <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200BD1\">Saturday night, Thursday night after practice, Friday night, Saturday, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s done! You know? So it\u2019s sort of like I\u2019m\u2026 what I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m doing, that\u2019s how, almost like I\u2019m planning for my post-soccer life, I think, and like\u2026 thinking about what that world looks like in realizing <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200BD2\">that there is more to life than the bar and like thinking about other hobbies and stuff that I\u2019d rather do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N200BF\">Which is different because I think this time last year, I was all about it, you know? But I feel like\u2026 and I would say I was only going to play until I was 30, that was totally a lie, I\u2019m going to play until I wanted to stop playing. But now it\u2019s like, \u201cAnother year of this? I don\u2019t know if I can make <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200BF1\">it another year of this,\u201d because it\u2019s just like\u2026 I realize that they\u2019re good guys and they\u2019re good friends and all that, but like, a lot of drinking. And it\u2019s like, the thing. You know, this very little \u201cother\u201d activity going on and I don\u2019t need that. You know? I don\u2019t\u2026 when I think about who I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200BF2\">to be, and where I want to go, like, that\u2019s just, it\u2019s not helping anything, you know? It\u2019s fun every once in a while, and that\u2019s fine, but\u2026 It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s helping me become who, you know, that person who I want to be, that like, kind of has a little bit more shit in order and like, a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200BF3\">bit better handle on himself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Seems like you want to make a new transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N200C3\">CLIENT: Well, I think it\u2019s a gradual one, though. I certainly don\u2019t feel like this is abrupt as anything else. You know, I feel like part of it is, and I know that, you know, you kind of grow up (inaudible\/blocked by siren), part of it\u2019s just recognizing these people and realizing where they fit in <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200C31\">my life and what they do for me, and even what they don\u2019t do. And what they do is they give me a really strong sense of family and brotherhood and friendship. And yeah, they\u2019re fun guys to hang out with, and you know, on the rare occasion when it is, we go catch a movie, grab a pizza, or go grab breakfast <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N200C32\">after a good workout, like\u2026 all for that! You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559634\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N200C5\">But when it\u2019s like Thursday night drinking buddies\u2026 not really where I\u2019m at anymore, you know? We\u2019re not\u2026 I may be, you know, they think I don\u2019t need to be there. And then I think, where I\u2019d be in general, it\u2019s just like\u2026 like we had our first practice yesterday, and like, I could hardly walk this morning <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N200C51\">(chuckles). And part of that is, you know, getting back into shape, all of that, but it\u2019s also like\u2026 the big, big time commitment. And it\u2019s a regular practice, two or three times a week, plus games on Saturday. So it\u2019s kind of like your whole life revolves around it, you know? You\u2019re spending three <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N200C52\">out of seven days doing it and then (inaudible at 00:45:50) those days travelling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N200C7\">It\u2019s a big commitment for something I\u2019m not doing professionally, never going to make the Olympic team or anything like that for, so\u2026 You know, it\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s been fun and I think I stick with it and see where it goes, but\u2026 understanding that it\u2019s not the \u201conly\u201d thing, it\u2019s okay to miss practice <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N200C71\">and, like\u2026 that helps me better, probably, explore what\u2019s next, you now? One of my co-workers is big into rock climbing. He loves that. You know, before I was doing soccer, I was taking a (prof ph?) course, like I had a great time with that, I was studying, you know, because I didn\u2019t want to lose that <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N200C72\">from when I was in Japan. And like those sorts of things all sort of fell by the wayside and it became all about soccer and I think now it\u2019s a little bit of a\u2026 not neces\u2026 maybe a transition is probably the long-term, but in the interim, it\u2019s probably a recalibration of where things fit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Well, on that note, we\u2019re going to need to stop for today.
