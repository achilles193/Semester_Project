I\u2019d be okay if he\u2019s dropping me off. I can walk faster. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: We need to schedule for June as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Thank you for rescheduling. Things went rapidly way down hill this morning. That\u2019s why I had to take a taxi, because I spent about an hour Facebook talking to my sister. I woke up late. What happened really on Friday or Thursday night was as it wound up, Jeremy realized, or read a report, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">Memorial Day traffic would be 30 percent worse than it was in years past, making it out of Chicago, and they anticipated after 2:00 pm for it to take five hours to go from Chicago to the edge.  We had to take my sister up to a doctor\u2019s appointment, and Jeremy and I were going to go to Chicago at 1:00 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">pm on Friday for the appointment. Jeremy and I originally were going to go down, and after dropping her off, she said she\u2019d be fine waiting. We\u2019d have a nice lunch, nice extended lunch, but once he found out about the traffic, he realized he didn\u2019t want to do the lunch anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">I was at Guy\u2019s. They talked before and realized that depending on when the appointment got out, they were either going to try to beat the traffic home, or have to somehow wait it out in Chicago.  Bless you. When I got home I heard the situation and was like, oh, we can wheelchair you around, Tammy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">We can go to the park. Oh, it\u2019s going to be a rainy day. Jeremy\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a rainy day. We won\u2019t be able to do much.\u201d We\u2019re like, oh, what about a museum? So he was looking up museums, and at first my sister said she was fine with waiting in the car while we went to the museum, but after Jeremy <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">went to sleep, and we made a plan just to leave right after the appointment to beat the traffic, my sister came up and said she was going to be in a lot of pain because of her back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">She had surgery on her hip, but it\u2019s her back that is not really being treated in terms of \u2013 she gets back pain. She things it\u2019s an early onset of the degenerative disc disease that my mom had back when she started 31, 32. My sister\u2019s 29, so I can see this is around the age she would get it. So then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">she said she\u2019s not going to be okay with staying in the car for six hours while we go out and see Chicago. She\u2019s going to be in a lot of pain, and we need to stop in a hotel out of the city so she can lay down during the six hours. I said, well, that\u2019s not going to work. What are we going to do during <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">the six hours that we\u2019re waiting in this hotel?  Jeremy and I talked about it, if traffic got really bad, maybe we could stop off in Evanston and see a movie. He\u2019s like, no, that\u2019s not going to make sense, or not what I want to do. Then when my sister, after Jeremy had gone to sleep, and we talked about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">this, what are you supposed to do? You can lay down and look at Internet videos like I do. I was like, that doesn\u2019t sound like fun. That sounds boring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">That\u2019s when she blew up and said how dare I elevate her pain to boredom, and I don\u2019t understand her pain, and if you leave me in the car for six hours, you better bring some headphones because I\u2019m going to be crying the whole way. Then I called my mom and mom\u2019s like, you\u2019re going to tell Tammy she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">going to have to deal with it.  It\u2019s unreasonable for you to get a hotel out of the city. Then I go back and Tammy\u2019s like, \u201cHow about I get a hotel outside of Chicago, like Evanston?\u201d Then there was the ordeal of having to drive her there. I was like, okay, we\u2019ll drive you there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735418\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: What are you feeling as all of this discussion is happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard because now it\u2019s all been processed. In one sense I feel bad because Jeremy is the one doing the deciding, and in a sense we\u2019re doing her a favor by driving her to Chicago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: One whole trip is for her doctor\u2019s appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: I understand and I want to be there for her, within sort of the means, and the boundaries, and confines of what \u2013 then Tammy said, \u201cWhy does Jeremy have to take a day off of work? Why can\u2019t you just drive me?\u201d  I don\u2019t have a car. Driving Jeremy\u2019s car, I would not feel comfortable. Driving alone <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">and driving someone else\u2019s car through Chicago, this is really a lot to ask of me. None of this was set in stone before when the appointment would be, and originally she was going to have the appointment, then fly off to Chicago, and Jeremy didn\u2019t find out we needed to drive her back home that night <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">for a flight on Saturday until the day before. That\u2019s why he was frustrated, because there were no solid plans. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">I feel really bad because of these things that I said, like what are we supposed to do for six hours? It was a legitimate question in the sense that granted, if someone is just like \u2013 I said it on the basis that it felt like she was getting her way and being ungrateful for what we were doing, and now <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">she\u2019s \u2013 unfortunately I relayed that to my parents, because my mom just called up my sister yesterday, and they got in a huge fight. More on that later, which leads to today. In the morning, I said, we\u2019ll drop you off in Evanston I\u2019m sorry I said those things. Now I sound frustrated, and it feels that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">she\u2019s ungrateful because we\u2019re doing her a huge favor to drive her to Chicago.  So then we drive her to Chicago. Then we wake up \u2013 sorry \u2013 we wake up the next morning and tell Jeremy we have to drop her off in Evanston. She wants to stay in a hotel. Jeremy\u2019s like, \u201cWhat? Why didn\u2019t you wake me up? I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">thought we were going to go straight home. What are we going to do? I don\u2019t want to add another two hours to our drive already.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">Driving to Evanston\u2019s about an hour when there\u2019s bad traffic. She would stay at the bottom, the way bottom, because it\u2019s what she could afford. Then he\u2019s like, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she just get a place in town? It will be $120.00, $150.00.\u201d I told that to my sister, and she was very angry about it.  I told <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">her that Jeremy yelled at me this morning. He didn\u2019t really yell at me. He yelled at the situation, but I was there. Tammy\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t afford a hotel in town.\u201d I was like, I found a place for $150.00. She\u2019s like, \u201cBut that\u2019s going to be $200.00 with tip and gratuity.\u201d I was like, I\u2019ll pay the difference. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">Just pay what you would at the hotel and I\u2019ll just pay the difference for you to stay in town. I\u2019ve had enough people yell at me. She\u2019s like, \u201cI didn\u2019t yell at you.\u201d I mean, she didn\u2019t yell. In a sense she didn\u2019t yell at me, like a traditional yell, but she expressed some angry things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735418\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: When you say yelling, you don\u2019t mean the volume, but the tone, or the feeling behind it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s what I mean. Then we ended up driving to Chicago. She\u2019s sort of silent. We take her, and drive her, and get into the \u2013 everything seems like it\u2019s all in the past, and this is what we\u2019re going to do.  But then I go with her into the hospital room, while we\u2019re waiting, and this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">when she starts going off and telling me, how dare I make her feel like dirt? She already feels like dirt. How dare I not understand her pain, \u201cAnd tell me that Jeremy yells at you, because that puts me in a difficult position.\u201d She was saying, \u201cMy friends,\u201d because she has friends that she talks to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">on the Internet, and they\u2019re great, good friends, \u201cBut her friend says she doesn\u2019t like Jeremy.\u201d Tammy was saying I shouldn\u2019t marry him, and that what is he going to do when I have cancer? He\u2019s not going to be around. He\u2019s the type of person who would leave me for another woman. I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200273\">sorry. I\u2019m sorry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">It\u2019s like, why is this happening right now? She was upset that we weren\u2019t going to take her into Evanston. She\u2019s like, \u201cBut I said Evanston, and I thought we came up with a compromise.\u201d I don\u2019t understand why there was all of this, then she just kept on going, then I started screaming and hitting myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">in the hospital room, and she told me I better leave or else they\u2019re not going to give her pain pills if she\u2019s associated with me. I just left and I was sobbing. I realize that Jeremy is not the type of person that will be ultimately flexible and give his whole self. He\u2019s not Mother Theresa. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">I\u2019ve always been like, I have bits of Mother Theresa by wanting to take care of my sister, and taking time out of my life. I\u2019m trying to write a paper, and do our things, so eventually after the hotel, she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think it\u2019s just a stressful situation for us all.\u201d I was like, it\u2019s okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">I\u2019m trying to move on. I just don\u2019t want to continue the fight. In one sense it didn\u2019t help because Jeremy wanted to leave at 2:00, and because Tammy\u2019s appointment was taking really long, he thought she was staying in there to make us mad and drive through the traffic, and I thought about that, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B2\">I was like, no, I don\u2019t think she would do that. Her appointment was just long. Then we had to get her pain medicine.  Eventually we drove back, and it took us \u2013 it was four hours to go down, and we got home at 8:00, so six hours to drive back. So a 10 hour drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Then of course I was relaying to my parents what my sister was saying, and I was like, I don\u2019t want my sister to be my maid of honor if she\u2019s saying all these things about Jeremy, but of course I realize it was Facebook. They called me, but you can\u2019t talk about these things driving back in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">car. We got through it later in the day, and I think Jeremy and I agreed that this was a little bit too much. It would have been great if she had a hospital in Rhode Island or Providence. That\u2019s very doable. Things were fine. We had to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not really local to New York. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: No, we\u2019re not, and that\u2019s what \u2013 I said \u2013 she\u2019s like, \u201cWhat about all the things I\u2019ve done in the past? I took you in a week when mom wasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d She did, but then again, I didn\u2019t\u2019 ask for these things, these favors. Like, picking you up from the airport was a 20 minute drive, not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">a 10 hour drive. So yes, you\u2019ve done nice things for me in the past, but there\u2019s a continuum of how big a favor you\u2019re asking. She even got on my case that I tortured her by giving her the generic Crystal Light, and no diet soda, or juice, and first of all, I forgot that she liked juice. I was making <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">her blondies, and desserts, to make her more happy. I wasn\u2019t doing it just for her. I do like to make desserts, but I was really trying to cheer her up, and make her feel good, and talk to her about her surgery. I\u2019m listening to her, and at the same point, I have my own problems.  That\u2019s sort of why <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200333\">I blew up in the hospital room because all of these on top of my own problems, and being able to write a paper, it\u2019s just a lot. I mean, I vented to my mom, because I don\u2019t really vent to my friends. It would seem like out of nowhere. Finally I contacted Gina because my sister said she was not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200334\">to the wedding. (crying) She said that mom called her up, and I primed her to attack her. I didn\u2019t prime anyone. I just vented to mom because\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735418\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. Then she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you and mom hate me.\u201d I was like, I don\u2019t hate you. I thought things were fine. I thought we grew past. I apologized for it.  Then she started going back on everything, and I said, you really hurt me in the hospital room. I was like, you said I shouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">marry Jeremy. I don\u2019t want her opinion. I want support, not opinions. She was like, \u201cWell, it was an ethical dilemma, and I felt like I needed to say something. Then she brought up when she first got married, and she was living with me because of summer school. Her new husband, just married husband, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200372\">said, \u201cYou should work out more. You\u2019re looking big.\u201d That\u2019s when Tammy was emotional. I wrongly \u2013 I was 21 then. I wrongly stepped in and said, \u201cWhy did you say that? That wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d I didn\u2019t remember that, but she brought my attention to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">She said at first I cussed him out, and I realized, no, I didn\u2019t cuss him out. I don\u2019t cuss. I have a hard time saying the F word, or saying any word. Of course I didn\u2019t even try to say, I\u2019m sorry I did that. I was young back then, and had I known what I know now, I know not to step in. That\u2019s personal <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">things. So I mean, she said that she doesn\u2019t ever want to see mom again, and she\u2019s not coming to the wedding. I guess I got my wish. She doesn\u2019t want to be the maid of honor. But it\u2019s frustrating (crying). She hasn\u2019t been a part of any of this wedding, and if anything, she\u2019s said hurtful things about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">Jeremy. I realize he\u2019s not Mother Theresa, and he still has some growing up to do, but in a sense, I feel that he\u2019s been supportive, and helped me, along with going to therapy, and working through things myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">He\u2019s been there for me. I do love him, and except for the few things I\u2019m getting over, his sometimes being over opinionated about fashion, and clothes \u2013 he\u2019s growing up too. Then I wrote a message to my mom. What did you say last night to Tammy? Nonetheless, she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you $100.00 to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">my CPM machine to\u201d \u2013 she left her hip restorative therapy machine at our house and it needs to be mailed back by UPS.  I said, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll mail it back. I tried to take care of it myself because I didn\u2019t want any more issues. I called up for the hospital bed for them to take it away. Then they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">called up her, and she was like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to call me back if you want it out of your house.\u201d I thought, why are you saying it like that? I was like, I called them on Friday. I called them on Monday, then on Tuesday, and finally on Wednesday they were able to pick it up just barely. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B3\">said, it\u2019s not a life-enduring thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735418\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">I had my hairdresser over at 10:30. She got fired, so that\u2019s why she came to my house to do my hair, as part of \u2013 even though it did wind up making a mess, it was part of I need my hair done, and she doesn\u2019t have a place to do it.  So do it at my house. I said the guy couldn\u2019t just come right over, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D1\">because the last time the guy came over, my cats freaked out and mauled my arms and legs, because they freaked out so much. I was so worried. I was like, I can\u2019t handle him coming over during the hair appointment. Eventually I called him right up after the hair appointment. He was able to come pick <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D2\">it up. So in one sense I feel mad at myself for losing my cool. I know my sister\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of things. I know she\u2019s in a lot of pain, but I know she didn\u2019t make me feel very good. That was the thing today. She was like, \u201cI sure wasn\u2019t staying there to be happy.\u201d \u2013 at my place. I was like, I did <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D3\">my best to make you feel comfortable. It\u2019s frustrating because she says these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Really hurtful things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, I understand that she\u2019s really not a mom, but I\u2019m going through my wedding. (crying) She said she\u2019s not doing it to hurt me, but it is hurting me. (crying) Saying those things about Jeremy \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t take it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: Now I\u2019m starting to wonder, is Jeremy a jerk?

I know sometimes he complains about these things, or has a hard time dealing with stressful situations. I mean, ultimately he\u2019s there for me in case something is really wrong, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">in terms of \u2013 that\u2019s like the last time when we found out my parents were having that thing, he was really strong, and listened to me, and took it one step at a time. In a sense he\u2019s not as strong with someone staying in the house with a hospital bed, and with there being a toilet protector seat.  He <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200492\">wasn\u2019t as \u2013 I mean, he still made my sister dinner, and drove her to New York, which was a lot, because he took a day off to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: He made big sacrifices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: I just feel like my sister, because she wasn\u2019t getting absolutely what she wanted, she said some very vicious things, and very much thinking about what\u2019s right for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting how what was a fight about you and your sister somehow became about Jeremy.  It sounds like the question of whether or not Jeremy is a good partner for you is something you\u2019ve decided already, and the issue of is your sister really angry at you, or angry at the world right <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">now, is separate from that.

In the same sense, you\u2019re not lower than dirt if you say something mean or vicious. It\u2019s just very hurtful, and I have feelings too. There\u2019s no way <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">to convey that without her going overboard, and that\u2019s been our problem since we were young, is\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: That you\u2019re not allowed to express your feeling, because she\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">CLIENT: Intimately tied into \u2013 we\u2019re either happy with her, she\u2019s a great person, or any little thing she does wrong is multiplied and exaggerated. For me, I wanted to \u2013 I saw her message last night, because I couldn\u2019t go to sleep last night, because I was wondering about my bridal gown. I read some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">Yelp reviews about this place. Like in, 2014, when I went to the bridal store, they had no reviews like this, but there were three reviews that talked about, they never called when her dress was ready. They lost the order. The dress came a week before the wedding and miraculously showed up. Then I realized <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200552\">I hadn\u2019t gotten a call, then I called them, and I couldn\u2019t give them a straight answer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">They\u2019re like, \u201cLet\u2019s talk to the manager and see if she can locate your gown, see where it is.\u201d I\u2019m like, where\u2019s my gown? So right now I don\u2019t know where my gown is. Now my sister doesn\u2019t want to come to the wedding even. Oh shoot. Do I make someone else the maid of honor? I know my friend Gina has <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">been planning the whole bachelorette party, and been really supportive and positive, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: Give your sister some time to cool off so you can see where she really is, then decide what you really want, but I wonder if some of the things she\u2019s saying, she\u2019s saying out of hurt and anger. There\u2019s time before the wedding.  You don\u2019t necessarily need to have a maid of honor. They can <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">all be bridesmaids, if that makes it easier. Then you don\u2019t have to worry about terminology. I know you want your sister to be there, and be supportive, and be a part of it, and I hope she will, but I think taking the pressure off who you\u2019re naming who, so we can focus on this repair of the relationship, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200592\">giving her some time to cool off, giving your wound some time to heal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: (crying) Things seem to \u2013 they\u2019re on a better \u2013 after the end, I was fine. I was like, I need to leave and get to therapy. It was 10:30. That\u2019s when I should have been on the T. I didn\u2019t even have time to have breakfast, or coffee, or anything. I just woke up and saw \u2013 the night before I did <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B1\">see her saying, \u201cI\u2019m not coming to your wedding.\u201d  I was like, I just have to go to sleep. Then I woke up to about 20 long line statements about how it\u2019s okay if I hate her and never want to see her again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Dramatic, provocative statements there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019m having a hard time writing my paper. I just want it to be done. (crying) I have a hard time because it\u2019s my first paper, and I need 100 percent focus. Now my sister staying over, it\u2019s hard to have 100 percent focus. There\u2019s things I sacrificed in terms of coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">home early, talking to her, seeing if she\u2019s okay, rather than just focusing on my paper and locking myself in a Starbucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735418\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">THERAPIST: And now you\u2019re still distracted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. That was the first thing I was going to do, run some calculations, because I have to talk to my advisor at 2:00 before he leaves for the summer.  I\u2019m just really frustrated because part of me just wants to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to de-friend her. I just want to turn off my Facebook so that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t check your Facebook for a bit. Give yourself some time, because she is being really provocative, whether it\u2019s intentional or not, or how conscious she is of what she\u2019s saying, the intensity of what she\u2019s feeling is fueling her to say things that are really hurtful. She may not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200651\">mean all of the words that she\u2019s saying. So to protect yourself from having to hear all of it, and be wounded by all of it, it\u2019s perfectly okay for you to take your Facebook off your phone a little bit, and just not engage with it. Give her some time, then the two of you can engage with each other when <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200652\">some of this has subsided. It sounds like part of this is just really intensely dramatic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">CLIENT: I mean, it was really \u2013 I explained the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I don\u2019t know who was the scary one. I think it was Mr. Hyde. I don\u2019t realize, but the sort of transition from \u2013 they talked over at dinner, and came to an understanding. I talked to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">THERAPIST: The flipside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, just totally flipped when Jeremy went to bed. I was like, if I had known this earlier, maybe a few days ago, that you were going to stay in Chicago, we could have made plans. I think that was the frustrating thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">THERAPIST: That made you feel really stuck in the middle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">CLIENT: That was the frustrating thing. It\u2019s one thing if you have a guest who knows when they\u2019re leaving, instead of \u201cOh, we can\u2019t get a flight for Friday. It\u2019s too expensive. Can I stay until next Wednesday?\u201d  That\u2019s when Jeremy had a hard time dealing with that, because that\u2019s over two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s okay to have limits and boundaries. That doesn\u2019t make him a horrible person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: I get frustrated because she talks about how wonderful her friends are, and how supportive they\u2019ve been. Well, they\u2019re not having to put up with your shit. They\u2019re not having to deal with you, and feed you, and take care of you, and give you a bath. All these things I did with a smile on my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200731\">face, and she said thank you, but it was just\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">THERAPIST: Doesn\u2019t feel like a thank you at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">THERAPIST: Just very much erases that feeling of being acknowledged. So I think that\u2019s sort of where I am today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m so sorry that\u2019s how things ended on this visit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess the other thing is \u2013 then my mom compared it to when Julie was over, Tammy\u2019s \u2013 a long time ago, because her sister in law, Julie, was going to school in the States, and was going to go back home, but the way the situation turned out, she was going to have to stay at their <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D1\">house, and Tammy got really frustrated, and yelled at Taco (ph) for having Julie over, and things escalated, and she ended up throwing Julie\u2019s laptop across the room, and Julie ended up leaving the country a day early just to get out of that situation. My mom compared it to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735418\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: So your sister does blow up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: She does. Last time she was here, there was that situation where she was saying she wanted to die after she saw the hip surgeon, and got lost, and couldn\u2019t find a taxi, or couldn\u2019t call a taxi.  We ended up having a huge screaming fight in the mall, out of all places to get into a screaming <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200811\">fight over the phone. I should have known this would be too much, but you can\u2019t say no to someone who really feels like they\u2019re out of chances. I like to give people chances. The fact that she doesn\u2019t \u2013 that was what she said today, \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about staying there. I wasn\u2019t staying there to be happy.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200812\">I\u2019m like, I\u2019m sorry. It just felt sort of \u2013 I felt like we were kind of used, and emotionally used.  I think it\u2019s just \u2013 in all senses \u2013 I don\u2019t know why my mom said these things to her. It certainly didn\u2019t help the situation. Then I was like, I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: Like you got put in between your sister and Jeremy, your mom got put in between two daughters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. Then my sister was like, \u201cMom\u2019s on your side for now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want to make it about sides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: We do have to wrap up for today.
