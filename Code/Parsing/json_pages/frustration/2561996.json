(PAUSE) So we spent the day yesterday with my mother or I did (PAUSE) at... In the afternoon, we took Grayson (ph), my mother and I, in the carriage to meet the woman she\u2019ll be sharing an apartment with for about a week and a half near her house. It was a lovely woman, just a wonderful <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">She\u2019s a (inaudible at 00:01:07) a child development psychologist, clinical psychologist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Hmm. What her name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Marianne Wellington (ph), I think. Anyway... (PAUSE) So my mother and I went on this little expedition and, you know, the meeting with Marianne was very, very nice and my mother... The apartment was good for my mother. (inaudible at 00:01:41) too fancy but comfortable. And Grayson was very... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">You know, he\u2019s like he his. He\u2019s very mellow. He had one moment of discomfort that we had... I\u2019ll come back to that later. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(PAUSE) So a couple of things happened. I mean, one thing that was difficult and made the day fairly stressful for me, at least the afternoon, was (PAUSE) my mother kept forgetting to set the brake on the carriage. So... You know, she really wanted to push it. And we had come to a light. And in Westchester, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">particularly when there\u2019s relatively... This area of Westchester where there\u2019s fairly good, you know, adherence to the ADA, most of the sidewalks have these little ramps. But what that means is, if you have a carriage, you know, there\u2019s fairly easy potential for, you know, the carriage to actually be, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">go into the road, go into the street. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So, you know, I kept on saying, \u201cYou know, you\u2019ve got to set the brake anytime you\u2019re at the light.\u201d And she would forget. It was classic... It was like she\u2019d forget. She bent down to tie her shoes. She went over to push the button so the light would turn green. One time, she said, \u201cOh, I thought you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">were holding it.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: And she just... It was so upsetting and stressful and classic, you know, just sort of, you know, very characteristic. And I don\u2019t think this is any fault of hers necessarily but she had a, she\u2019s had a fairly hard time soothing Grayson which I\u2019m guess with infants is pretty common but I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">parents are so unfamiliar people. It takes them a little while to develop, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">You know, it takes him a little while to develop familiarity that\u2019s relaxing. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily because she vibrates very fast. Although she probably does and it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s actually true. And so I kept on having to kinda, figure out ways she could kind of be with him, both <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">for her own sake and usefully, that would not be upsetting to him. And, you know, in the end, at the end of the day, I kind of figured out that, you know, the thing to do was to put him to bed and to kind of set her up in the nursing chair near the crib just so that if he woke up she could kind of tend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">to him in the, as a way of sort of getting, an intermediary phase rather than saying, \u201cOkay. Can you put him to bed now?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">But, again, you know, A, it was getting to this point... It felt very stressful. (PAUSE) And I felt like a... I felt stressed out by the need to, you know, to make her experience a good one. You know? And, you know, kind of frustrated with the need to kind of serve this particular set of needs or the, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">you know, the compulsion or sense of responsibility to satisfy these sort of needs. Classic stuff, I assume, when the grandmother comes. This does not feel exceptional. And, you know, her... Her spaciness is something that is very characteristic and worrisome and, ultimately, I said, \u201cListen, anytime <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">you push the stroller, I want you to tether yourself to it with your purse or something and set the brake every time you\u2019re at a light.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561996\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">And she said, \u201cOkay. Basically I won\u2019t take him out in the stroller until we\u2019ve gone through an entire walk together and I\u2019ve remembered to do this in each case.\u201d And I think, in the end of the day, during the month, there are going to be very few times when she takes him out in the stroller as the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">kind of end result of this expedition. Which, on the one level, is sort of too bad and, on another level, we\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t mean that I would prevent her from doing so. She seemed very chastened and kind of nervous as I pointed these things out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: She took it in good grace. But, you know, this is... This is a very distinct characteristic of her just this intention, difficulty multitasking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">I also discovered that in her household right now... I said that my stepfather is much older. She\u2019s the one who deals with all the logistics. (LAUGHTER) Like her husband can\u2019t really deal with it anymore so it all falls on her. I have no idea how that works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: But... (PAUSE) Anyway, so... (PAUSE) This is kind of the background to a couple of very intense conversations that we had, kind of family conversations in which... I mean, like I think one of them she complimented the way that Jennie (ph) and I are sharing responsibility for Grayson and I said <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">(PAUSE) suspecting what the answer was likely to have been, \u201cDid Daddy do anything, you know, when I was an infant.\u201d And she basically said no and she was completely alone and the implication... I mean, he was always off doing something else and she added much, much more detail than I had previously <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">gotten about, you know, kind of what the scene was during the first, I don\u2019t know, two years, two, three years of my life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">And it sounded just like, just crazy. I mean, as crazy as you can get... This is not a revelation. I think we\u2019ve probably alluded to it or spoken to it directly a fair amount. But just like complete upheaval and I would say some megalomania and just basic disconnectedness from the reality of what you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">need with a, you know, with an infant and a toddler. And, you know, so the one time... So she had me with her every moment until I was climbing out of the playpen at fourteen months or whatever. And... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">At which point, I was sent to childcare which I basically knew. And there were all these kind of catastrophic breakdowns of supervisory authority and childcare after three months of which she quit the collective. It wasn\u2019t just that she said, \u201cOkay. Well I\u2019m not sending him to collective childcare.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">Apparently, the implication of not agreeing to send the baby to child care was that her association was over and she was no longer working in the collective enterprise. She got her own enterprise. Apparently, my father and her father in law, my grandfather who was, he had a (inaudible at 00:09:47) store <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">in the (inaudible) district in Chicago bought her a knitting machine so that she could go into business with a cottage industry in the market allowing her to take care of me which she couldn\u2019t do in any of these other enterprises.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561996\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: So it was like this big breach, you know, a much bigger breach than I had realized. And she spoke of it... (PAUSE) She spoke of it with, you know, a lot of intensity, you know, a lot of intensity. So, you know, there was this one conversation about all of this stuff and, you know, about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">first time she let me out of her sight when my father and a couple of other members of the collective took me hiking and they brought me back with mosquito bites over 90% of my body and kind of in, almost in anaphylactic shock at the age of eighteen months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Oh my.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: And, you know, it was the first weekend she had without me since she was born.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: You know, so just like massive breakdown of, you know, the appropriate level of supervision over a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Like real, you know, certifiable neglect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Certifiable neglect that she was kind of the only party willing to intervene and she wasn\u2019t always able to intervene because she had his conflict between, you know, sort of conflict of agency where she couldn\u2019t kind of say no. So there are all of these things that led to neglectful situations <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">that she just didn\u2019t feel empowered to say no to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: I see. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: So, you know, this was one thread of conversation. And, you know, on the one hand, I don\u2019t know, I went through this very intently and just sort of engaging with it and coming to terms with it and trying to understand it and having it be very, very present, you know, four or five years ago and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">now I can see how emotional she was about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">And she was... You know, it was heavy. But it wasn\u2019t like I was kind of reliving it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Personally... I didn\u2019t feel like I was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: You know, like Grayson is my son and Jennie is my wife and my household is my household and my life is my life and it felt like a story of some kind that touched on me and touched me. But the intensity that my mother was describing it with was what I think I was connecting with at that moment <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">anyway. And then later, after we got home and it turned out that, you know, in... I kind of lost a little bit of oversight capacity in dealing with my mother on this expedition which lasted a little too long and, you know, sort of coming straight home after meeting with Marianne, we went to get a bite <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">to eat because my mother was very hungry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">And it turned out Grayson had wet himself and it had soaked through. She had been that last one to do the diaper so it kind of soaked through his clothing. But... He was... You know, it was a little cool, I would say. So it wasn\u2019t great... It wasn\u2019t super cold out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: But, you know, he wasn\u2019t chilled. He wasn\u2019t shivering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Nothing super extreme like that. But he wasn\u2019t super comfortable. He didn\u2019t cry. He doesn\u2019t... He\u2019s a remarkably good self-soother. But I felt really bad. You know, I felt kind of like a failure. I felt as if I had experienced a failure. And, anyway, we got home. We got him to sleep. And he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">went to bed very early because he must have been sort of expending a lot of energy sort of keeping his (inaudible at 00:13:47), I guess, I imagine. And my mother and I sat down after we had put him down at the kitchen table while Jennie worked. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561996\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">And we had another conversation about her visit with Hilda (ph) who had Micah (ph) in August and it had been a very difficult pregnancy. So my mother came in June and was there three months. And it was apparently a completely disastrous visit...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: ...for a variety of reasons, one of which was that (PAUSE) you know, not unreasonably because it was so long, my stepfather Xavier (ph) came during the last month of it. And he was just completely nonfunctional. They think that he wasn\u2019t taking his blood pressure medication. There was some stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">that might have been going on medically. But he was just really needy and he kept on saying things like, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need to stay up with Micah. You know, why don\u2019t we go out to dinner in the city,\u201d and, you know, stuff that... It was just like a very inappropriate...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: ...thinly veiled attempt for my mother to pay attention to him and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: ...in competition with the newborn and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: You know, so one thread that my mother was very focused on was just this tendency to have difficulty rationalizing or balancing competing needs and to kind of assert what it was that she wanted to do which was to spend this really... She was very intense when she said this. To spend time with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">the, you know, her grandchildren in their infancy for, you know, a month or two at a time. And I was listening to her as she was saying this and she repeated and she said, you know, how much she just wanted to, has been wanting to spend this time with Grayson and with Micah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">And I turned to her and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a do over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I don\u2019t... I didn\u2019t say it quite that boldly maybe. But it was very clear this was what was going on. It was like she just felt like there was such chaos and she had no control and now she had the opportunity to rectify it and to balance <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">the needs and it was... This visit was so hard for her because she kind of wasn\u2019t able to do it. You know, she wasn\u2019t, she couldn\u2019t... She had a really hard time balancing Xavier\u2019s needs and this fairly inappropriate expression or assertion of them with Hilda\u2019s needs. You know, this was three days after...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Postpartum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: ...after she had given birth. (PAUSE) And so, you know, at one point, we had, I said, not having heard this backstory yet, that it was kind of a shame that Xavier hadn\u2019t, it would have been fine for Xavier to come and stay given the arrangement with Marianne and how well it\u2019s worked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: And she started to cry. And I\u2019m like, \u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you know, should I have done this? Should I... Was it right for me to tell him, you know, to stay away so I could be here because I had not wanted a replication of the situation this summer?\u201d And... (PAUSE) I just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">I realized how invested she was in this, you know, in these two visits, these two month long visits with these two infants, you know, in conditions that, where she could really assert, you know, to some degree, in this new role, this new relationship her, you know, her need to care, her need to give care. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561996\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">And that... You know, I thought about that and that\u2019s, on the one hand, I was, felt empathetic and was moved by it. On the other hand, like holy fuck. You know? Like I don\u2019t want... We need stuff from her. He need her to X. But I don\u2019t want her to be worried she\u2019s having, you know, once again, a good <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">experience, you know, given how strong her personal need to care effectively for the infant it. I don\u2019t want it to be freighted down with, you know, all of this, these forty years of trial and travail and family, you know, dynamics and complexity, psychic complexity. You know, we have needs. Grayson <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B2\">has needs and we need to serve them. Jennie and I have needs and we need to serve them. And hopefully, you know, it can be good for my mother as well. You know, so I guess I was left after this long day together, feeling on the one hand, really A, kind of moved by her experience, B, you know, thoughtful <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B3\">about my own experience, C, concerned about, you know, having to navigate between those two and how it\u2019s analogous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I have a question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

In fact...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: No. She was not neglectful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:20:19) and she was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: When I was out of her sight for the period of when...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Like the child care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: ...I was in collective childcare and then she...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Then she said, \u201cForget it,\u201d and left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: So, you know, I think that there...

I mean, I wonder. The way... She, in her very self-effacing and, you know, somewhat... Later, talking about it, Jennie called it degentified (ph) which is probably about right. In her way, she\u2019s said, \u201cOh, you know...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561996\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">It\u2019s like she\u2019s so anxious and... I mean, I think that, you know, she was in a state of acute anxiety this whole time and the only solution to the overarching state of neglect... Like one example that she gave me in passing was when the heat broke and the, one of the windows was broken in the nursing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">home squat (ph), she just had to keep me, at the age of, I don\u2019t know, Grayson\u2019s age right now, two and a half, maybe three months, at her breast the whole time to keep me warm. You know? So... (PAUSE) (SIGH) She was, I think, I would guess, in this setting, acutely anxious for my well-being...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: ...for her well-being, for, you know, and just not... I think of her with Grayson where she\u2019s having a difficult time settling him and I imagine, in my mind\u2019s eye, that it was probably some difficulty settling me if she was this nervous all the time and this upset all the time and this kind of... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And (inaudible at 00:23:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: ...thwarted all the time.

And be... Exactly. And be, have the opportunity...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:23:31) for a do over in how she was so much as a do over in the kind of setting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well maybe both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Maybe... I... You know, I can\u2019t speak for her. I\u2019m only trying to reflect back...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: ...my interpretation of her conversation. But I imagine that it\u2019s really nice for her when she can put him to sleep, you know, when she can preside at least over his going to sleep. It really makes her happy. And I imagine, right, where... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">(CROSSTALK)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: ...hard for her to soothe me and put me to sleep because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Probably because it was freezing and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Well, whatever. God knows. God knows. So anyway, I took her home at about ten and I said to her, you know... (PAUSE) I said something like, \u201cOh, it was really moving to hear you talking about this and this is kind of the way that I understand it. And she said, \u201cYeah. It kind of makes sense more <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">or less. I should probably go and see a therapist about this, et cetera.\u201d And I said, \u201cListen mom,\u201d and she was getting out, \u201cOur priorities for this trip are in this order, you know, Grayson\u2019s needs, Jennie\u2019s and my needs, and then your needs. And I really hope that, you know, that we can serve all of them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: I just felt the need to just be kind of clear and explicit about this and at the same time to be kind of welcoming about what sounds like a pretty, you know, profound process for her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">So it was very... It was very heavy and not, you know, only or principally because all this family history was so, you know, actual for me at that particular moment although probably some of it too, as you know, I tend in that direction. But in... So I came home from dropping her off. It\u2019s like two <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">minutes away. It\u2019s really a good...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a good situation. And I came home and Jennie was finishing one of her three syllabi. And so I said, \u201cThis was so intense. You know, we don\u2019t need to talk about it right now. But I\u2019d like to kind of just sit next to each other on the couch.\u201d And she... So it took her about half an hour to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">finish and we had a cup of tea and she\u2019s having a migraine and I think she was also just kind of in the state that one is when, in the last week before classes start. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561996\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">So she was, you know, amenable but not quite there. So we were not totally intercepting. But (PAUSE) somehow the way that I told it made her worry, rightly or wrongly, I can\u2019t speak to that, that, you know, I was kind of doing this thing that I do sometimes where, you know, I\u2019m just sort of back in, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">I\u2019m very invested in the impact of these, this period on all of my experience today. You know? I just kind of... I am very attuned to connections between, you know, how I am now and what\u2019s difficult for me now and these conditions and I think you know what I mean. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And this is sort of all fitting together in kind of a new...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: In kind of a new way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: ...kind of a new way, which is this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: That...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, no. Please.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking of (PAUSE) Jeffrey (ph) in a way as like, in a way, in terms of this combination of both your mom and dad in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I\u2019ve thought at times that I was describing it explicitly in those terms. I certainly think of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: The way I\u2019m thinking of it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: I think of it in those terms at times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: The way I\u2019m thinking of it is that... (PAUSE) And maybe this is the way you are as well. That... You know, so there are these competing needs that your mother had with you as a kid or you had today with her, you know, that you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Oh sorry. Yesterday, that you felt it important to sort of (PAUSE) be clear with her about it in terms of your priorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: But there\u2019s still this sort of pull on her side which is quite intense actually, which it always is like with Xavier and you dad. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s been like them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: But, you know, she\u2019s having this intense experience. Like you feel for what she needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: It really matters to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: And yet, it... (PAUSE) It\u2019s not the priority and it\u2019s easy to see how it could pull you away from... In principle... I don\u2019t mean it will. But like how it could pull you away from being focused in the way that you want to on Grayson. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">You know, for example... (PAUSE) Again, I don\u2019t think it... I\u2019m not saying it will. My point is just the tension...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a tension between, you know, what might be satisfying for her and what you think is best for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: And so... (PAUSE) Then when you\u2019re talking to Jennie, it seems like, you know, in that moment, she\u2019s worried about kind of a similar dilemma with you, that you\u2019re going to get pulled off into this emotional vortex and will kind of (PAUSE) sort of lose focus and then she\u2019ll kind of having <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">to be dealing with you, I think this is probably her worry, and whatever needs to be done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, we spoke about... We spoke about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: I think fairly explicitly. And she expressed that concern, you know, in fairly similar terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561996\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: So that... Anyway, my point is that that part, that kind of absorbed, preoccupied, distant from the circumstances sort of (PAUSE) demanding part seems like your dad. (PAUSE) And the (PAUSE) you know, maybe worried but more focused and in touch with what needs to be done but kind of anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">and feeling a pull from another set of demands seems like your mom taking care of you when you were little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Maybe.

And to exorcise this sort of conflict that\u2019s in you, you just need to write this story.\u201d And I guess that\u2019s, in theory, a good, a metaphor <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201492\">for psychotherapy in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s also the way that I\u2019ve thought about this novel a variety of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: You know, this novel that I\u2019ve been wanting to write for years and years.

(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">I don\u2019t know. It was just sort of imaginably maligned almost. Maybe not intentionally. But that was...

Just sort of emotions, at some emotional level, the figure, this sort of absent figure, absent now, you know, by death and absent then by, I don\u2019t know, alternative interest <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F1\">was, felt very maligned in everybody\u2019s life. And that was striking to me and uncomfortable to me. I think when I have that thought I feel, you know, on the one hand, I feel like it\u2019s unfair. You know, it\u2019s very convenient for somebody who\u2019s no longer around to, you know, to play this role as the bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F2\">guy.

And I don\u2019t know what to do with that quite because it doesn\u2019t... I mean, I guess write my novel. (LAUGHTER) It <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201811\">doesn\u2019t feel quite right.
