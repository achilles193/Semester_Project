People I know who have worked with him have felt pretty highly of him. His name is Martin Howard and he\u2019s in Waltham. He\u2019s a guy and he\u2019s sixty-something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: What\u2019s his practice like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s a long-time therapist\/ analyst, probably an [MDE] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay.  I\u2019m in a bad place about Jeremy\u2019s therapy, which I think is the same thing as being in a bad place in general. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that specific to Jeremy. I don\u2019t think he wants to see a woman. He\u2019s not making moves and he wants a little break.  He wants to see what it\u2019s like without <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">a therapist. He\u2019s talking with me more. Sometimes I\u2019ll ask for thoughts and feelings time from him or for me. It usually involves a foot rub. He\u2019s been giving it more spontaneously, which is great, but my reaction to it has been . . . These are great things to bring up, (inaudible at 00:02:48) excellent <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">therapist. I haven\u2019t said that in so many words to him, but I did ask him what was on his mind about it and he was not thrilled with all the various inconveniences of the people who seem more compatible with him.  He\u2019s not thrilled with the women and the non-available-ness of Gavin. That was one thing; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">and then the other thing was he\u2019s not really looking to be in therapy right now.  Sometimes for him, there is this false crutch, like I\u2019m in therapy; therefore I\u2019m working on myself. That actually hasn\u2019t been the case for most of the time when he is in therapy. He hasn\u2019t actually felt like he\u2019s made <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">any changes that are useful, so he doesn\u2019t want to enter back into that default \u201cI\u2019m doing something\u201d mode, which he thinks would be easier to do if he jumped right back into therapy. Somehow, I have a really hard time accepting that. I feel so differently already today, having shared some of my thoughts <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">about it with him last night. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I think I have more hope or trust in you than I do in him, and so if he were to see somebody who is like you, then that\u2019s way better, for complicated reasons. I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s better, but it feels better. It\u2019s like a better idea in my head, like Jeremy has his parallel thing. I\u2019ll feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">less alone in my feelings. I think the personal challenge is going to be great for him and it\u2019s going to be great for me, which also I have no idea.  I\u2019m thinking maybe it will be like I\u2019m married to somebody more like you if he sees somebody \u2013 or I\u2019ll be married to you; then the separation will be less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What a nice thing to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s what it is. Thanks. (pause) I couldn\u2019t say that, but what am I going to do? Let him know that it was really overwhelming. I shared with Jeremy these same things \u2013 not in so much detail, but pretty much like my therapy is hard and it\u2019s overwhelming me and I feel alone with it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\"> If you take a step that feels parallel, that\u2019s a very soothing idea for me (sniffling) and it\u2019s very hard to hear about how he doesn\u2019t want to do that. There is also the part that actually does have to do with him, which is I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that confident in his self-journey. I don\u2019t know what that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">would be. I don\u2019t know what it would look like. I\u2019m so steeped in my own journey.  I think I have such a specific idea of what real change looks like, at least in that moment, I\u2019m obviously not always allowing for another idea would not involve therapy or would not involve an insight kind of practice. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">(sniffling) I think Jeremy was not [so thrilled] (ph?) to be talking about it. (pause) Why can\u2019t I talk to you more about it, like why do I have to see a therapist. I don\u2019t know. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to see a therapist.\u201d I kind of thought about it for a little and I tried to come up with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">what I thought was happening. Then I felt this distance between us got even larger and he was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is ever going to be parity between me and you (inaudible at 00:09:36) because I\u2019m never going to see someone three times a week.\u201d It\u2019s like \u2013 pow \u2013 I felt like it was really hard to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562502\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll always be by yourself in your journey in terms of therapy.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Are you trying to convey that you understand how I feel or are you telling me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: No, no. I was imagining that\u2019s what it felt like. You said he said that, and it was like he stabbed you in the heart. It seemed to me like there is probably more that could be said about why his saying that felt that way, and that is what I imagined \u2013 that he was saying \u201cwe\u2019ll never be on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">the same page like that. You\u2019ll always be in that without me. \u201c That\u2019s what I meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: You\u2019ll always be in that without me is one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: And the other, I guess, is him saying \u201cI\u2019ll never be like that,\u201d which also means, I think for you, in that way, he won\u2019t be like me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes. I\u2019ll never be like Jay and I\u2019ll never change into somebody better for you.  Also, I was pretty calm and clear-minded about this today and suggested a different way to think about how hard it is for me that he\u2019s not rushing to find another therapist. I\u2019m pretty insecure about this. I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">this validation. It would be very meaningful to have this validation all the time. So for him to say something like \u201cI would never do that, but I value it\u201d or \u201cI see its value\u201d or \u201cI realize it\u2019s very important to you,\u201d that kind of left me feeling worse than when we started.  The same thing plays out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">with meditation. It\u2019s not as charged, but there is a similar dynamic about it. This asks a lot of me, too, and sometimes too much. Sometimes this asks too much of me.  Other times I feel like utterly wrong for the practice, like it\u2019s a bad fit, like I\u2019m not good enough for it. Then it\u2019s hard to persist <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">in it and it\u2019s hard to show up again. It\u2019s hard just to (inaudible at 00:14:29). I have, somehow or another, but in those times, it\u2019s really bad. It feels really bad to hear it from somebody so important, like \u201cI would never do that\u201d because it\u2019s kind of like \u2013 well why am I? If Jeremy would never do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200294\">it, why am I doing it?  But that comes and goes. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s kind of alienating from things that do mean so much to you.

I was feeling really down before this conversation with Jeremy when he told me that he is shelving the therapist thing for a little while on Monday. I was feeling really vulnerable and low energy, sort of losing a lot of steam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: I guess I didn\u2019t expect you to say \u201coh\u201d to that.

It\u2019s very, very \u2013 it\u2019s like festering. (pause) I guess I feel compelled to tell you or reassure you that there is not a crisis happening. There is really not too much I can do. My experiments are slow and I have a bunch of papers to write. I have a committee meeting in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">week and a half. I have to write stuff for that. I don\u2019t have too much energy or interest in any of it.  (pause) It\u2019s bothering me a lot. That\u2019s the worst part, how much it\u2019s bothering me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s bothering you \u2013 the disinterest in it? Okay. Not the work itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: The work doesn\u2019t feel out of my reach. It\u2019s very hard. Writing a paper seems very excruciating, like slow, iterative, lots of sitting with it, sitting on it, waiting for Kelly, not really knowing too much about how it\u2019s going to turn out.  That doesn\u2019t seem great at all, but it doesn\u2019t seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">out of my reach. It seems out of reach because I\u2019m disinterested. I\u2019m anxious, which I have been. My anxiety feels debilitating. It feels like there is just so much managing it, taking the time. For example, I could get to the lab an hour earlier if I didn\u2019t practice yoga and meditation. I could leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">a lot later if I didn\u2019t do those things at night or were here.  Also, in the lab I take lots of breaks. (pause) People just want so much from me, too. I can\u2019t turn them away because they\u2019re so important and (inaudible at 00:22:22). It\u2019s very tiring being there; but we\u2019re all learning and I\u2019m getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200393\">better at isolating myself (inaudible at 00:22:35) small chunks of time and coming back, like the 45-minute writing module time. That\u2019s helping our interactions.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It seems to me with some of the things today you sort of cry on my shoulder, which is not, I don\u2019t think, often how [things seem to be] (ph?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: I feel confident about that. I don\u2019t know. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I guess it feels like a bit of a risk. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: It used to. My defenses melted into a puddle. I don\u2019t have them anymore \u2013 or at least some of them. Maybe that\u2019s something I used to feel that you don\u2019t feel as if (inaudible at 00:25:50).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: I see.

I don\u2019t think I would have made it through two pages of this at any other time in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">life.
