It\u2019s been a fun week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Crazy. Yeah, talking to Google was an interesting experience. That was\u2026 it was good actually. They seem much more likely to negotiate than I thought, so I\u2019m optimistic. But I\u2019m still cautious, because I think there\u2019s a lot more negotiation that has to happen around what\u2026 the job I\u2019ll be doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">and what that looks like and what my future looks like there, because I told\u2026 I met with my boss. [0:01:04] And that went really well. She\u2019s a cool chick. We\u2019ve always gotten along really well on a bunch of different levels. But then I did that, and then I met with my boss\u2019s boss\u2014who I\u2019ve had issues <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">with in the past\u2014on Sunday. And it was different because I could tell, based on what she had said and based on what he had said, he was really doing his best not to come across as desperate. But in his own way he was like, please come back. Please come back and (inaudible at 0:01:33). So that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">a nice feeling to feel wanted like that, which is good because that\u2019s different than what I left with, right? When I left, I didn\u2019t feel like anyone gave a shit. And it\u2019s good to have that\u2026 the tables turned there and feel like, hey, you actually\u2026 what you did here was really important. And it took <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">us eight months, but we really do appreciate that a whole lot, and we want you back to do more of that. [0:01:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">So that was\u2026 it\u2019s nice to have that discussion and then be like, okay, well, we\u2019re passing your name along to the vice president of the division, and he\u2019s going to give you a call to talk through this. And I was like, okay, cool, finally. We\u2019re getting somewhere! Why couldn\u2019t you guys have just done <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">this while I was working there? So that\u2019ll be\u2026 that\u2019s next\u2026 I mean, he\u2019s the vice president, so he\u2019s probably pretty busy. But that\u2019ll be something that happens\u2026 this should happen this week. And then we\u2019ll start the fun stuff, which is negotiating salary and level and stock and cash and signing bonus <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">and all of those fringe peripheral things that will shape what the compensation looks like. So it\u2019s good, though. It\u2019ll be a good\u2026 it should be a good gig, meaty, challenging problems to solve, a lot of ambiguity on the engineering side. There\u2019s two different, completely divergent pieces of technology <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">that we have to bring together, which is always a fun challenge. [0:03:03] There\u2019s a lot to learn about how we do things, how different things build software, but then also about the software itself. There\u2019s another [track there] (ph), which is, just because we\u2019re bringing these two pieces of technology <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200234\">together doesn\u2019t mean we get to stop working on them for two years. So it\u2019s like we have to keep building on top of them, but, instead of sort of building on parallel tracks, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019ve got to build so that we can converge at one thing. That\u2019s a part of it, which is\u2026 that\u2019s always tricky, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200235\">because how do you add features that are building you in the right direction towards this? There\u2019s the stuff that you won\u2019t do, right, because each piece of software does its thing on its own. And there\u2019s some special stuff over here that only this one does, and there\u2019s some special stuff over there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200236\">that the other one does. How do you manage that with the customers who are paying seven, eight, nine figures to use the software, that they won\u2019t have access to that stuff? [0:04:00] So there\u2019s that angle.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">And then there\u2019s just the general, how do we actually make people understand what we\u2019ve done here? So the marketing side of it. So I get to have my finger in lots of pies, which is exciting. And then the people. There\u2019s two or three people who I\u2019ve mentioned to in confidence, like, hey, I\u2019m thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">about coming back. And they\u2019re like, yes, please, immediately, and how much do we have to give you to come back? So more of these would normally be people that I\u2019d be working with day to day or more people that were just\u2026 had worked as peers to me while I was there. So it\u2019s good. It\u2019s good to know that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">both you are wanted and still liked somewhat? So that was really cool. But work, like, regular\u2026 not Google work, but regular work has been just nuts these past\u2026 I think since we released the new version of the product at the beginning of the month, it\u2019s just been a blur. I can\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">figure out how much time I\u2019ve spent working, but it feels like it\u2019s done a lot. [0:04:58] It just seems like I wake up in the morning, and I hop (ph) on e-mail for a little bit, hope in the shower, and then pretty much that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about, which is not good (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: And I think that\u2019s more of\u2026 that\u2019s the nature of the business, though. Software is a little bit more cyclical than\u2026 it\u2019s not like steady state. It\u2019d be like being an accountant around tax time. There\u2019s seven, eight months out of the year where an accountant\u2019s not slammed. And then there\u2019s probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">two or three where they\u2019re totally slammed and then another however many, another two months or so where it\u2019s somewhere in between. Software\u2019s like this. And this being the first release of this size at this company I think is part of what\u2019s caused a lot of growing pains. For example, from the time <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">that we said\u2026 from the time that the CEO said, flip the switch\u2026 so the time that we flipped the switch was a matter of minutes. And in that span of time the engineering team changed three quarters of the code that powers the entire thing. [0:05:56] So lots of things got changed, and no one\u2019s exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">sure what got changed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">So there\u2019s lots of trickledown effect, which is\u2026 it\u2019s frustrating actually, because you end up getting pulled in all of these different directions. And you end up spending an inordinate amount of time doing customer support, which is fine when you don\u2019t have other responsibilities. And, when I say customer <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">support, it\u2019s not like helping a customer who\u2019s paying us a lot of money to solve some complicated issue. It\u2019s sort of the things that you would use when you pick up the phone and you call, I don\u2019t know, Dell. And you\u2019re talking to\u2026 that first person that you talk to? That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">just\u2026 it\u2019s been draining because it\u2019s a lot of the same sorts of things. And no one\u2019s happy. The customers aren\u2019t happy because stuff has changed and they don\u2019t understand it. You\u2019re not happy because you\u2019ve got other things to do. The boss isn\u2019t happy because you\u2019re not doing those other things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">you have to do. And it\u2019s sort of like this big, I don\u2019t know, mess of stress. So that will go. [0:06:55] And I know\u2026 I\u2019ve done software long enough to know that this is just something that will pass. And I\u2019ll bitch about it, and then in a couple weeks it\u2019ll be like, all right. Well, that phase is kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B4\">of done, which is\u2026 it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019ll eventually end. It\u2019s not like this forever. So that\u2019s been a challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">[We had our first contact where we practiced] (ph) last night, which was tiring, really tiring. Just I think I\u2019m really burnt out right now from work, so I think that that\u2019s starting to play into it, which is\u2026 I\u2019m going to Baltimore this weekend with Melanie. So that will hopefully be relaxing. At least <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">it\u2019ll get me away from work and all that for a little while. But it\u2019s\u2026 like, on Friday one of our\u2026 one of the guys on the team has got a new apartment and big housewarming party. And I got out of work at, I don\u2019t know, maybe 12:30 at night. And everybody\u2019s like, oh, come out. And I was like, yeah, no, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">I just got out of work. I\u2019m going to go home and go to bed because I\u2019m really tired. [0:07:57] I just worked a, what, 14, 18 hour day after doing all of\u2026 it\u2019s been like that. So they\u2019re like, no, come out. And then I get the cold shoulder at soccer practice, I didn\u2019t go to this housewarming party. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D3\">like, fuck. This isn\u2019t\u2026 really? I thought we were friends. And I don\u2019t go to a party, and there\u2019s a banquet this weekend. I\u2019m not going to that. I\u2019m going to Baltimore. And one of the guys was like, you know, it really bothers me when people are just blowing this stuff off. It\u2019s not optional. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D4\">was like, well, no, it is. It actually is optional. This whole soccer thing that we do is optional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">It\u2019d be one\u2026 it\u2019d be totally different if I hadn\u2019t seen these guys and we hadn\u2019t gone up to Stowe and had a soccer tournament, we hadn\u2019t had multiple different parties and get-togethers and things, if I never saw these guys? Yeah, a banquet would be important. I go out with these guys every weekend. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">I see some of them two or three times a week outside of soccer practice. I\u2019m not obligated to go the banquet, and, even if I was, fuck off. This is club soccer. I\u2019ve got a life. [0:08:55] And I think it\u2019s a little bit of what we had talked about last time, of just calibrating investment or planning <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">a transition. It\u2019s just like, no, there\u2019s a place in my life for soccer, and that\u2019s it. And I understand the\u2026 what I\u2019m willing to commit to it, and, if that\u2019s not good enough for some people, that\u2019s too damn bad. That\u2019s their\u2026 that\u2019s kind of their problem, because I realize that I can\u2019t be doing it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">I can\u2019t be at home from work at 12:00 at night and then go drinking until 5:00 in the morning and then try to have\u2026 try to do volunteering the next day. It just\u2026 it doesn\u2019t work (chuckling). So that felt\u2026 it felt good. I felt like a dick, and that was probably more because of how I delivered it. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F4\">it felt good, ownership. Like, this is mine. I\u2019m not going to do this thing that I don\u2019t want to do, and that\u2019s pretty much it. And I don\u2019t\u2026 and it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m sort of thinking about this. If you\u2019re going to be mad at me about that, I mean, that\u2019s fine, right? We can talk through it. [0:09:56] But, if you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F5\">going to give me the cold shoulder, I\u2019m like, what is this, fifth grade? Like, I didn\u2019t go to your birthday party, so now we\u2019re not friends anymore? So that was\u2026 that made it interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">And then of course when it\u2019s a day of\u2026 it\u2019s tackling for two and a half hours, eventually you just get too tired to be pissed at people, and it sort of dissipates. But still, at the beginning, it\u2019s like, okay, I see where you all stand on this now. So that was different. I haven\u2019t had a practice like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">that, where it felt like that, like, where it\u2019s just kind of like, I\u2019m doing it, but I\u2019m really just not thinking about everybody else there. It\u2019s like I\u2019m just doing what I need to do. So with Melanie it\u2019s weird. I\u2026 the best way I can describe it is it\u2019s just like, over the past couple weeks\u2026 like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200312\">it was really great when we got back tougher, and like, yay. Everything was really good, and I think that we\u2019re\u2026 maybe we\u2019re coming down off that emotional high or something? But I\u2019m just kind of, oh, I don\u2019t know, sort of blas\u00e9 about it? [0:11:01] Not blas\u00e9, that\u2019s not the right word. But I was trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200313\">to talk to her about it today, and I was like, I don\u2019t know. I just feel like, eh. Like, it\u2019s not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: About her (inaudible at 0:11:08)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: The\u2026 I mean, I think the relationship. It\u2019s just kind of, eeeeehhh (sp?). Like, yeah, we\u2019re going to Baltimore, that should be fun. But I\u2019m not\u2026I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like not\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2026 it\u2019s not even that I\u2019m not excited. It\u2019s like I\u2019m almost indifferent. You know, like, eeeeehhh (sp?), okay, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">is it. And it\u2026 and I think it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what causes it, but I think it\u2019s probably a couple of things. First, so she\u2019s unpacking her stuff at my apartment. She\u2019s like, well, let\u2019s make this the last time. It\u2019s like, okay, yeah, sure. I don\u2019t ever plan on it being\u2026 I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200352\">think about these things like, okay, you\u2019re going to unpack your stuff, and then in two weeks you\u2019re going to have to pack it back up. But then there\u2019s part of me that\u2019s like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Is she moving in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: No, she just put her toiletries and all that. [0:11:57] And it\u2019s like, well, hold on. That really just\u2026 that comment rubbed me the wrong way. And then\u2026 since then it\u2019s just been like, I don\u2019t know. Like, I don\u2019t about this (chuckling). And it\u2019s weird, because that comment\u2019s probably in and of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">itself not that big a deal. But then it\u2019s like, what\u2019s this coming from? I feel like I should be more excited about this person who I\u2019m with and who I think I love. And I\u2019m not. And it\u2019s just like, I don\u2019t know. I was really glad that I didn\u2019t\u2026 like, I got home, and I was like, yeah, I\u2019m going to bed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">I\u2019m tired. And she was out with her friends, and I was like, great, I don\u2019t have to talk to her. Like, I was excited about not having to talk to her. And I\u2019m going to Baltimore with her to meet\u2026 to visit some of her friends who just had a baby. And I know them, and they\u2019re cool people. But it\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200393\">I don\u2019t really want to do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">I\u2019m feeling almost like I\u2019m ready to be done with the relationship, which is weird but not actually abnormal, because now this would be, what, the nth time that I\u2019ve decided I didn\u2019t want to be in the relationship with her. [0:13:04] Which I think maybe in and of itself is telling, to the effect that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">we haven\u2019t gotten it to stick after so many attempts. So I think what I\u2019m going to do with this, though\u2026 because in the past I\u2019ve gotten out of it and then wanted to get back into it, I\u2019m going to let it ride for a little while longer and try to give it a month or two and see if this is just sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">part of the natural ebb and flow of things. And if it\u2019s still\u2026 if I\u2019m still feeling then, like, the middle of September, sometime around my birthday, [I\u2019m not going to] (ph)\u2026 why are we doing this? I\u2019m not enjoying this. Yeah, and she\u2019ll be pissed about that, but that\u2019s maybe okay if she was pissed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Well, what happens when you\u2019re in it, and what happens when you\u2019re not in it that makes you want to go back to it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t\u2026 well, when I\u2019m in it, it feels really good for a little while. And then it just\u2026 it feels like it burns out, and then we kind of just grate on each other? [0:14:03] So it becomes like this tension-filled thing? And then when I\u2019m out of it I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know quite what it is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">that I miss when I\u2019m not in it. I think it\u2019s more I\u2019m lonely than anything. I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s that I miss her or if it\u2019s that I just miss having a partner in crime on things (pause), which is probably\u2026 yeah, maybe that, because, I mean, it\u2019s shitty. It\u2019s shitty being alone. I\u2019ve been in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F2\">relationships pretty much my whole life. I was in a nine-year relationship, and then I was single for a while. And then I was with Melanie, and then on and off kind of for the past, I don\u2019t know, six months. And then it\u2019s like, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t like feeling lonely at times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">But then there\u2019s times when I really do enjoy just Friday night. I don\u2019t have to do a goddamn thing. [0:15:04] I can go home and read and eat dinner and go to bed and sleep for 12 hours if I want to, get up in the morning, go for a run. I like that. I like that a lot. And it may\u2026 you know, maybe that\u2019s\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">that could be part of it though, because if it\u2019s\u2026 (Pause) Well, if it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m in with her. She\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say she\u2019s clingy. (Pause) She\u2019s clingy. She\u2019s clingy. There, I\u2019ll say it. And it\u2019s like there\u2019s no amount of relationship that we can be in that feels like it\u2019s enough for her. And I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200412\">she\u2019ll never say it, so it\u2019s certainly my interpretation of how she\u2019s acting. But it\u2019s like\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t\u2026 if we lived together right now, I wouldn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know if that would feel like it was enough for relationships for her. [0:15:55] And if we were engaged she probably wouldn\u2019t be happy until she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200413\">had grandkids with\u2026 from our kids. You know, if our kids had grandkids, then maybe she\u2019d feel secure in that. And that\u2019s\u2026 I\u2026 that\u2019s probably partly my doing because I broke up with her so many times. But at the same point it\u2019s like, that doesn\u2019t\u2026 that\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s a weird feeling to feel that your partner <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200414\">is insecure in your relationship, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">But I think that that also factors into the\u2026 that kind of drives me away a little bit because it\u2019s like, you\u2019re needy, and I don\u2019t want lots of needs on me. I like that\u2026 I like feeling that independence a little bit more, which\u2026 so back to your question of\u2026 that\u2019s probably partly what drives me out. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200431\">And then when I\u2019m away it\u2019s like, hey, I can do whatever I want. That\u2019s really fun for a while. And then, hey, I\u2019m really lonely because I\u2019m doing whatever I want. Oh no, I miss her, and that\u2019s probably not the case, right? I probably need to be\u2026 I\u2019d probably be better situated with somebody who was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200432\">a little bit more of a balance of the two instead of kind of being clingy. I don\u2019t know. [0:17:02] I don\u2019t know. (Pause) But yeah, maybe that\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know how you bring that up with somebody either, because it seems like that\u2019s kind of how you\u2019re wired. Be like, hey, you\u2019re kind of clingy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20045\">Like, on Friday I didn\u2019t\u2026 I was working, so I\u2019m not super social, chatty, online or whatever when I\u2019m at work. And I just\u2026 I had\u2026 we had talked a little bit, and I was like, all right, hey. I\u2019ve got work. And her texts just got angrier and angrier and angrier, that she\u2019s like, well, obviously this isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200451\">a big deal because she should have gone out to the beach. And I had told her that my dad\u2026 my dad was supposed to come up on Saturday, and my dad wasn\u2019t coming up. [0:17:56] And I was like, okay, cool, I\u2019m going to chill out, and then maybe I\u2019ll come out and meet you at lunchtime. And she was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200452\">mad about that, like, I didn\u2019t immediately come out to the beach that evening, and\u2026 because my plans had cancelled, that means that I should have gone to spend time with her. I was like, I didn\u2019t really want to spend time with you. And that\u2026 it bothered her before I said that? Then I was like, look, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200453\">I need a little space because I\u2019ve been working a lot. I just need to decompress. And it didn\u2019t land at all, which\u2026 that\u2019s actually\u2026 that\u2019s probably where it starts because that\u2019s bullshit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20047\">I need to be able to say I need my space. And I think someone who would be good for me would respect that or at least get that at some level and wouldn\u2019t try to then foist themselves onto me, because that\u2019s the exact opposite thing that I want, right? I want you to just say, okay, yeah, take some room. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200471\">We\u2019ll just catch up. We\u2019ll grab lunch, and then we\u2019ll spend the day together. And it was like a fight about that. And it\u2019s a stupid thing to fight over. [0:18:56] But when that happens it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t want\u2026 stop. Don\u2019t make this more work than it has to be. It doesn\u2019t have to be work. And then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200472\">go out there on Saturday, and we have a great time. It\u2019s a killer time, we go home, it\u2019s a great time. We just have\u2026 it\u2019s fun, you know? And it\u2019s like, why did you have to make such a big deal about me coming here, whether I was here at 8:00 in the morning or noon or 3:00? Who cares? We\u2019re out here <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200473\">having a good time. So that was wild. That was just\u2026 I think that\u2019s probably what started to set this whole thing in motion. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20049\">I just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to deal with that. I\u2019ve got\u2026 I\u2019m trying to get myself situated? And, when I have that kind of nagging drama lingering, I don\u2019t need that. I don\u2019t want that. That\u2019s not who I want to be, and that\u2019s not who I want to be in relationship with. And when I think about\u2026 as I\u2026 as we work <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200491\">through this stuff, I don\u2019t want that to be something I have to deal with. [0:20:05] And I understand that people fight and all that. But it\u2019s like, pick your battles. And then don\u2019t try to guilt-trip me into coming out there, like, well, obviously you care more about yourself than you do\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200492\">like, well, you know what? Yeah, because if I\u2019m not in a good spot I\u2019m not going to be in a good spot to be partner to you, kind of thing. So yeah. (Pause) I don\u2019t know, but I think ultimately giving it a little bit more time\u2026 because obviously this could just be, we\u2019re up here and then maybe we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200493\">done here and whatever. But I think a month or two\u2019s probably enough to see if this is really worth doing or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004B\">THERAPIST: What would you need to have change for you to want to be\u2026 stay in it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

It\u2019d be nice to be excited to see my girlfriend instead of like, yeah, it\u2019s my girlfriend. [0:21:03] I\u2019d like that, you know? I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D1\">feel like I have that right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like soccer.

And practice, sure, no problem. I mean, when you think about\u2026 during the summer\u2026 so this is when there\u2019s no soccer, I would play touch soccer twice a week and work out with the team once a week. That\u2019s three nights a week during <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200551\">the summer when we don\u2019t have soccer. That\u2019s fine, totally happy to make that happen, do that all summer. Come to practice, practice twice a week. Leave work early to go to practice. Miss meetings, reschedule my life around being able to get to these two practices. And then you\u2019re going to lecture me <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200552\">about how I can\u2019t make it to a banquet when essentially my entire summer, summer tournaments, the whole shebang\u2026? You\u2019re going to give me shit? [0:22:01] Well, what about the guys who weren\u2019t at any of that? Oh, they can make the\u2026 so they\u2019re a better soccer buy because they did that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20057\">So I think that it is a little different than soccer because it\u2019s not\u2026 I don\u2019t have a problem committing to soccer. I enjoy the game, and I\u2019ll play it for probably another year or two. What I have a problem with is when there\u2019s sort of this defined thing, and then there\u2019s this optional thing that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200571\">can do, and it turns out it\u2019s actually not that optional. I have one free weekend between now and Thanksgiving. That is this weekend. And I\u2019m using that to go away. I don\u2019t have another weekend like this because of soccer. There\u2019s sometimes when I\u2019m going to leave work early on a Friday to drive four <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200572\">hours to play soccer on Saturday, to drive four hours back to Boston. So I feel like my commitment is where it needs to be for soccer? It bothers me when there\u2019s that whole double standard. Well, if you didn\u2019t come out drinking with us (inaudible at 0:22:54). You know what? I didn\u2019t. [0:22:56] That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200573\">because I practice with you guys for three nights over the course of the week. And I\u2019ll see you guys working out on Saturday morning, and then we\u2019ll go to the Friendly Toast. It\u2019s like\u2026 it\u2019s almost like in that regard the expectation is, there\u2019s never enough, and I do that enough to myself. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200574\">need other people to do that for me?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s how you described Melanie\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

There\u2019s no effective way to say no. And then it\u2019s like, well, they want me to be the fundraising chair. It\u2019s like, I guess? I mean, no, I don\u2019t really want to do that, but it\u2019s like, at some point you have to draw <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200631\">the line. And the bitch of it is that I really do enjoy playing soccer. I do, but at some point I need to have a life outside of soccer. [0:23:57] And that\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s a thing that I do. It\u2019s not who I am. And it\u2019s at the point now where it\u2019s like I\u2019m scheduling my life around Tuesday, Thursday practice, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200632\">which is fine. But give me my fucking weekend. My one\u2026 (Chuckling) this is my one weekend. But yeah, I think\u2026 and maybe I bring that on myself because of who I am?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20065\">But with Melanie it feels like\u2026 I guess it does, it feels like the same thing. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no amount of boyfriend that I could be that feels like it would satisfy the need. There\u2019s no amount of fianc\u00e9 or husband. There\u2019s nothing\u2026 there\u2019s no relationship level that we could get to where it would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200651\">be enough. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want to feel like that from a girlfriend, because it feels like a burden. And that\u2019s not the point of a relationship. I think a relationship\u2019s like a partnership. And somebody can pick you up when you\u2019re down and make you feel good if you\u2019re not. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200652\">you do the same for them, and you want to spend time with them. And you kind of get each other, and you like the same kinds of things. [0:24:59] That to me is what a relationship is, not this thing you just tolerate, or it\u2019s a burden. That\u2019s what married people do if they\u2019re married for twenty years. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200653\">And I bet there\u2019s even married people who are still happy. I know there\u2019s some point in the future where you can be a burden to each other, but that\u2019s not a year into a relationship maybe. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20067\">I think the other thing is, too\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I could ever really get over it with Melanie. There\u2019s still some part of me where there\u2019s a lot of resentment towards everything that happened between us. And I think that that probably also is where this comes from because it\u2019s\u2026 I know who she <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200671\">really is, and I know who she tries to be. And that\u2019s great. [0:25:57] But (inaudible at 0:25:58) your past against me. I\u2019m not really quite ready to let that go. And you\u2026 whether or not you did it intentionally, you did some pretty bad shit. Everything that I did that you don\u2019t know about, it will <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200672\">stay that way. I never used anything I did against you or tried to make you feel guilty or bad. But you\u2026 she did. And I think that says a lot about somebody. All\u2019s fair in love and war. And it\u2019s like, well, you want to make sure you\u2019re playing by the same rules. And I felt like (chuckling) we were civil. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200673\">And I didn\u2019t hear about anything that she did, and she never heard about anything I did. But I worked really hard to make sure that that happened. [If I tried] (ph) to date her friends or anything like that\u2026 but still it was\u2026 this is what I\u2019m doing, and that\u2019s none of her business, and let\u2019s keep it <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200674\">that way. And she totally shattered that with an explicit, direct, hey, this is what I did last night, and it was awesome. It\u2019s like, go fuck yourself, like, really. So maybe that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s probably more where it comes from, because that came up when we were fighting.

I wanted to have a threesome with you, and you went off and did that. And it was\u2026 and in my mind at <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006B2\">that moment they were completely equitable things, going up to Vermont and making wine, her having a threesome. And that was the absolute correct response at the time because\u2026 in my mind, right? I want to do this, you want to do that. I\u2019ve never done this before. I\u2019ve never done that before. You\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006B3\">never done either of these things. Things to do together, now we\u2019re going to do them apart. [Fuck off] (ph), you know? And that\u2026 I think that that\u2026 (Pause) That\u2026 I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s fair. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s bad, but it felt really\u2026 it felt good to say that and to just let it out. [0:28:04] <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006B4\">It was like\u2026 I won\u2019t say cathartic because [if it were cathartic] (ph) there\u2019s like that release that comes with it? I don\u2019t know if it was that, but (pause) it felt\u2026 it was just, like, yeah. In my mind these things are equitable, and you fucked that one up, not me. And now\u2026 it\u2019s very petty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2006D\">Maybe that\u2019s actually why I wanted to go make wine. I ended up not doing it, but it was still like, yeah, yeah, yeah. That\u2019s [when I\u2019m 100%] (ph), hey, hold on this works. Yeah, (inaudible at 0:28:38). But I don\u2019t know, maybe it was just in the heat of the moment. But it was just\u2026 it still\u2026 I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006D1\">it still does bother me. What the\u2026? Why would you do that? Who on earth thinks that that\u2019s a good idea? And I was like, am I dumb for trying to date somebody like this? Who knows what else the future holds here? [0:29:01] I don\u2019t know. But certainly all of this, all of that factors into feeling just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006D2\">kind of, hmm (sp?), nonplussed about the relationship to, like, ah, take it or leave it. If she was like, I want to break up, [okay, fine] (ph). I don\u2019t even know if I would care at this point, which is worse than\u2026 because if you\u2019re angry at least you care. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m apathetic at this point. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006D3\">It\u2019s like, eh. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Didn\u2019t take long this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20071\">CLIENT: No, no, it didn\u2019t. I think\u2026 I mean, I feel like it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m going to give it some time just to see. But to your question, what changes? I don\u2019t know if anything changes. It\u2019s more just for myself to say that I gave it time. Just because I know doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m 100% certain. Could go to Baltimore, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200711\">have a great weekend, and then we kind of come out of that, way up here, and we\u2019re running high. And maybe we can kind of carry that.

You guys are all on the same wavelength. Well, she was like\u2026 I mean, she just\u2026 she made the same point. She was like\u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to going to Baltimore, she\u2019s looking forward to going to Baltimore. It\u2019s going\u2026 it\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200791\">be\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a great vacation. But then it\u2019s like\u2026 but then what? Nothing has changed, right, between us. It\u2019s still the same thing. So what then? Do we just try to muscle through it? I don\u2019t know. I can even\u2026 I wish I could at least quantify the issues that\u2026 so you could talk through them, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200792\">like, okay, great. She\u2019s clingy. I definitely need more space than she does. She\u2019s probably more social than I am. She thinks I\u2019m immature. I think she\u2019s kind of a stiff. I\u2019m certainly\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I know I can be a pain in the ass sometimes and, yeah, immature in some regards? [0:31:04] Yeah, absolutely. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007B\">THERAPIST: How does\u2026? Do you know what she means by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007D\">CLIENT: Well, just the whole drinking thing. She thinks that\u2019s really immature. She thinks that my friends are immature. I don\u2019t\u2026 in her mind adult life is having a dinner party. And I totally love to do that. I live in a studio. My apartment\u2019s smaller than this room. I could fit four people in there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2007D1\">maybe, comfortably, and certainly not for dinner. So it\u2019s like, I can\u2019t do those sorts of things. Having a fast car, I\u2019ve always had fast cars. I\u2019m never not going to have fast cars. That to her is immature. It\u2019s like, well, why don\u2019t you just get something boring and adult-like, like a Toyota Camry <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2007D2\">because it\u2019s reliable? And it\u2019s like, well, because I don\u2019t want a Toyota Camry, and I can buy whatever car I want because it\u2019s my money. [0:31:55] So don\u2019t try to weigh in on those things? You know, like that. I\u2019m trying to think of what else. Like, I like to play video games sometimes. And it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2007D3\">like I play video games addictively, but sometimes a new video game\u2019ll come out, I\u2019ll play it for a while. Maybe the new Grand Theft Auto when that comes out I\u2019ll get it and play it. Well, that\u2019s immature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007F\">THERAPIST: So you don\u2019t feel she\u2019s accepting of you. She can be judgmental?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20081\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve told her before\u2026 the way that I say that is, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t get me. Like, I like\u2026 and this is another thing. And I\u2019ve never really known how much weight to put on it, and I don\u2019t know if I ever will. I suppose I\u2019ll know when I know. But her interests and my interests are very\u2026 there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200811\">very little overlap in the Venn diagram, right? She likes to read People magazine and watch sort of mindless TV. I like\u2026 or doesn\u2019t care\u2026 she doesn\u2019t care about science fiction, or she has trouble\u2026 she falls asleep all the time at movies. [That was always something] (ph), like, I love to watch movies, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200812\">all different kinds, not only science fiction. [0:32:56] I love Star Wars, Game of Thrones, all of that. I read like a\u2026 I mean, I make it through Jared Diamond. So that\u2019s not exactly an easy task for everyone. And it\u2019s like\u2026 that\u2019s like\u2026 I love that, and I feel like that\u2019s part of how\u2026 I mean, we talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200813\">a little bit about wanderlust. That\u2019s part of how I satiate that, right? You just\u2026 you could read a book and go somewhere else. You can do something else, you can learn about something else. And you don\u2019t actually have to leave anywhere. And that\u2019s why I love books. I\u2019m just a voracious reader. Her, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200814\">not so much. I bought her a couple books, never anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20083\">So it\u2019s like, back to the immature point. It\u2019s like, getting me, not really accepting me, not internalizing it, it\u2019s probably all of those. Or some combination of those things manifests itself from her mouth as immaturity towards me. But there\u2019s just not a lot of overlap there, even in the interests <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200831\">outside. I\u2019m athletic, the soccer thing. I work out a bunch. It\u2019s a thing I do, it\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve been doing for more than half my life. [0:34:00] It\u2019s certainly not going to change now, but it\u2019s also important to me. So, when she spends the night, she\u2019ll grumble because I wake up at 6:10 in the morning, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200832\">and I\u2019m out the door quarter after 6:00, and then she drops the keys off. That makes her feel not good. And I understand that makes her feel not good, but I have to work out. My dad had triple bypass surgery at 47. I don\u2019t want that to happen to me. And the way that that doesn\u2019t happen to me is you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200833\">eat better, and you exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20085\">And certainly exercise\u2026 whether you\u2019re going to exercise for 20 minutes or 45 minutes, it\u2019s a huge investment because it\u2019s going to pay for itself. That\u2019s adding years to your life. Why would I not want to do that? And yes, snuggling in the morning is a lovely thing, and there\u2019s a time and a place for <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200851\">it. But on Tuesday morning I\u2019m up, and I\u2019m going to the gym. And I don\u2019t think that she likes that. Well, no, I know she doesn\u2019t like that. It makes her feel unwanted. But it\u2019s sort of always been like that. That\u2019s who I am. [0:35:01] That\u2019s part of what I do, and that\u2019s not something that will probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200852\">change in my lifetime. I work out, and I work out in the morning because I\u2019ve never been asked to come into work early. I\u2019ve never been asked by a customer to have breakfast or anything. I\u2019ve never been called up randomly by one of my friends who just woke up and said, oh my God, I\u2019m so hungry, let\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200853\">go get breakfast. But all of those things happen at the end of the day. Let\u2019s go grab a beer. Let\u2019s go get dinner. Oh, this customer\u2019s in town. Let\u2019s go get dinner. Customer called, runs late. Customer on the west coast needs to talk with you. All those things happen, totally ruins the ability to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200854\">any type of routine. In the morning, I want [my routine] (ph). And that\u2019s why I do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20087\">And I\u2019ve explained this to her, and it\u2019s just\u2026 it doesn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s like, psssh (sp?), over her head. She gets it, but she thinks it\u2019s like a, this thing is more important to you than me, because you\u2019re willing to spend\u2026 you\u2019re not willing to do this snuggling thing. Not opposed to snuggling. Love snuggling. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200871\">I\u2019m a snuggler. But in my mind it\u2019s like, yeah, I\u2019ll do that. But I have a schedule. [0:35:59] There\u2019s only so much time I can work out, and I have to get that in. So that I think probably ties into what you were saying before as another manifestation of just not understanding where I\u2019m coming from <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200872\">and who I am. (Pause) Yeah. It feels shitty though. It feels shitty to kind of go through this again. But I suppose, when nothing\u2019s changed and you keep coming back to that thing and you\u2019re expecting it to be different\u2026 I guess it\u2019s better to optimistic than otherwise, but I don\u2019t know why I would have <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200873\">thought this time would have been any different because nothing had changed, which still feels shitty. So\u2026 (Pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20089\">The\u2026 it will still be fun to go to Baltimore though. And I think that\u2019s the thing that\u2026 I know\u2026 we always travel really well together. [0:36:58] I don\u2019t even know if we travel really well together (chuckling). That\u2019s bad, but\u2026 no, because it\u2019s like, we\u2019re going to Baltimore, right? So Baltimore\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200891\">Africa. It\u2019s not a 17 hour journey where we\u2019re going to parts unknown. It\u2019s Baltimore. Definitely\u2026 she is definitely checking a bag. Not in and of itself a big issue, but the principle of checking the bag\u2026 to Baltimore? We\u2019re there for 48 hours. How much stuff do you really need? Something about that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200892\">there\u2019s an alarm in the back of my brain going off, going, hey (ph), what you packing in there? What you got? And it\u2019s just\u2026 so this is the type of stuff where I get back to tolerating, begrudgingly having somebody in your life, feeling, tolerating, yeah. It\u2019s like, that\u2019s\u2026 it probably shouldn\u2019t be like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like it\u2019s sort of a theme, you think she needs too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, no, that\u2019s a good\u2026 but, now, I\u2019m wondering, am I putting that on myself? [0:38:00] Or is that coming from her? Or is it a combination thereof? Because I could see\u2026 I can see where\u2026 from\u2026 for her, I\u2019m the anomalous thing in her life, right? If you look at relationship history in men, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008D1\">it\u2019s been bad relationships across the board. And I\u2019ve been fortunate. All my girlfriends, it\u2019s been good until it wasn\u2019t good any more, but then we kind of went our separate ways, and that was that. With\u2026 but with her, she\u2019s never had a guy that treated her really well or\u2026 whatever I\u2019ve done I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008D2\">I treat her well. But she\u2019s never had a guy like this before, and I think she\u2019s simultaneously afraid to lose it, but at the same point she wants to lock it down quickly because she\u2019s older. So biological clock is ticking. But that also could be me projecting that onto her because that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008D3\">what I want to see. [0:38:56] But she certainly isn\u2019t\u2026 one of my buddies, he\u2019s 25. He dates a 37-year-old. And she\u2019s just totally chill, super mellow every time she\u2019s out with us. It\u2019s no big deal if we\u2019re drinking out of\u2026 whatever we\u2019re drinking out of, it\u2019s not an issue. There\u2019s no snide comments <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008D4\">or anything like that. And I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t bitch at her, or she doesn\u2019t bitch at him once they\u2019re away from everybody else about how that was\u2026 she seems like she legitimately has a good time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2008F\">Melanie has a good time for a little while and then just gets a big pouty puss on her face. It\u2019s like she\u2019s not\u2026 high-strung, maybe? Uptight? I don\u2019t know what it is, but maybe she\u2019s past that phase of her life. And that\u2019s still where I\u2019m at at times. And\u2026 (Pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t even remember what we <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008F1\">were\u2026 [help me] (ph) on that. (inaudible at 0:39:47) how did we get there? Right, yeah. She needs a lot. Yeah, and I guess that\u2019s the thing. She\u2019s always told me\u2026 and one of the things, when we were going together and it was going really well, she was like, I love the way you treat me in front of your <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008F2\">friends. [0:40:00] You make me feel so needed. So yeah. Yeah, that could be it. Maybe that\u2019s just something that I need in my life, I need someone who\u2019s a little bit more independent, someone who\u2019s not (pause) clingy, super clingy, who can kind of get on in life. It feels like\u2026 or at least feels like <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008F3\">they can get on in life without constantly checking in four, five, seven, ten times a day, just constant communication. It\u2019s okay for there to be some silence in there. (Pause) That would probably be nice. (Pause) Yeah, that would be nice. Maybe somebody a little bit more athletic, too. [0:40:55] Start <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2008F4\">scoping out what the dream girl looks like right now (chuckling). (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20091\">Yeah, it just sucks though because it\u2019s like\u2026 you want these things to work out. And I don\u2019t like hurting people because that\u2019s not\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think anybody wants to hurt anybody else. But it just\u2026 it feels bad to know that this is the road that I\u2019m on again, to do this to her again. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200911\">is the nth time now. And I\u2019d love to have a way to make it stick, just be like, this is really\u2026 I mean, I know this one is actually it. She won\u2019t\u2026 she probably won\u2019t be around anymore, which is probably okay. It\u2019s probably actually for the better because, if we try to stay social, it doesn\u2019t work out <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200912\">because we always end up sort of drifting back together. (Pause) Yeah. But I still think\u2026 I have to stick it out just for a little while longer just to see if this is kind of one of those phases. [0:42:03] Because while I know the issues haven\u2019t necessarily changed, maybe my outlook on things will change <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200913\">over the course of a couple weeks. I\u2019m saying that to make myself feel better. Yeah. I would honestly\u2026 I would probably do it now if we weren\u2019t going to Baltimore. But might as well just go to Baltimore. We\u2019re scheduled. I need the break and have fun and then come back. And we can kind of figure it <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200914\">out.

I mean, it\u2019s shitty no matter what. But doing\u2026 I\u2019ve done this to her\u2026 like, last time we broke up was on her birthday. And that was\u2026 we were supposed to go to San Diego the following week. We were supposed to actually go to San Diego. Her birthday was the beginning of June, and the next <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200951\">week in June\u2026 or we\u2019d had dinner for her birthday the third or second week of June? And her birthday was on a Wednesday, and the following Tuesday we were supposed to go to San Diego. [0:43:00] It was like, you\u2019re not going to San Diego. Get the hell out of my apartment, kind of thing. And that\u2026 I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200952\">that pissed her off a lot because she\u2019s like, what the\u2026? Really? I was like, yeah, really. Go (chuckling). (Pause) But I would feel really shitty doing that again. I mean, I feel shitty enough having to do this, but doing it before we go on a trip again is probably\u2026 that\u2019s a new level of dickishness. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200953\">I can tolerate a trip to Baltimore. I have fun in Baltimore. And we\u2019ll have\u2026 like I said, we\u2019ll have a good time while we\u2019re there. And then coming back we can see how it is, and it will feel the same, and then I\u2019ll know. I\u2019ll know then that it\u2019s okay, time to call it and just go from there. (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200954\">But yeah, just doing it before would just be\u2026 that would be bad. I would not feel good about myself. I would feel really bad about myself and what I did. [0:44:01] Because I know that that would\u2026 it\u2019s just not\u2026 to do that once to somebody\u2019s pretty low. But to do it again is pretty fucking bad, I think. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200955\">She\u2019s booked this trip to Baltimore. Her friends are excited to see us. Let\u2019s just go through with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559646\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20097\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you\u2019re talking yourself into (ph) something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, probably. I mean, it\u2019s\u2026 I just\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 (Pause) I\u2019m not heartless enough to do it before we leave, you know? That just doesn\u2019t\u2026 and I need the vacation. There\u2019s that, too. That\u2019s probably a big chunk of it. (Pause) Yeah. I should have known better this time. I should have. It\u2019s actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200991\">absurd to think about this, because I think about other people who\u2026 you know, you\u2019re on the outside of this, and you\u2019re looking at it. [0:45:00] And you go, what the hell are they doing? Any\u2026 I look at my friends who\u2019ve broken up and got back together, and you\u2019re like, why are you doing that? You have <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200992\">so many other\u2026 (Yawning) excuse me\u2026 so many other people out there. What are you doing? And they kind of keep doing this, and then eventually there\u2019s something that finally pssssshhh (sp?). And I feel like I\u2019m not one of those people for the first time. It\u2019s [not like] (ph), coming back, coming back <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N200993\">(inaudible at 0:45:24).
