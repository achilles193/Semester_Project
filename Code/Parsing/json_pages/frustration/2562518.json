Monday, I spoke to Helen when I got home and so I smoothed things over. She is apparently she s going to not drink for a while, because she tends to make decisions that she later regrets. So we ll see how that goes, I guess. Yesterday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">was so busy, I just didn t really have a lot of time to think about anything else, so it made the day go quickly. Also, I ended up hanging out with Sergio for a little while on Monday. He had called me. [1:00] I hadSorry, I m on high alert, because of people doing this conference and sorryJust let <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">meOkay. So I had written him messages that, you know, like, what are you talking about? What do you mean you couldn t check your Facebook? All this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">And then so later, a little while after I got off the phone with you, it was an hour later, maybe. He called and said, you know, I got your message on Facebook and everything and I wanted to call you rather than message back, just cause I ve been running around trying to deal with this phone. [2:00] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">Da, da, da, and I really didn t mean anything when I said, nice seeing you besides it was nice to see you. I m glad that I caught you in the morning, and I didn t come on Sunday, because Sunday was a bad day for me. The phone broke. I was dealing with tenants doing this, tenants doing that. Whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">So and that, you know, he wanted to see me if I d like to have a drink or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">So I did, and it was really nice, and he was really nice. And we really get along well and have a connection, but he sends mixed signals. He acts very like, couply or that he cares about me a lot. But then, he doesn t commit. So I don t know what I m supposed to read from that or how I m supposed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">feel. It s left me today then after yesterday I was not really thinking about stuff. I was too busy or whatever. But it s left me today kind of feeling sad about the whole everything again. [3:07] And I don t think it s how I want it to be. And it s cold. And whatever. And so now I m feeling like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">really want this thing to be over, so I can go home. I don t know. But once I get back into the diet, eating better this week and exercising and whatever. But then the last couple of days and today I m just feeling like I should go home, lie around and they go to bed early or something. Not do anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">[4:13] And, yeah. (pause) [5:05] [6:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I guess I m thinking about intrigue and deception. And I don t know what to make of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Like, in regards to what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I m going to lay it out. I just haven t gotten there yet. Well, I m thinking about what happened to you and also what happened and like, what you do to me. I m thinking of Yeah. I m thinking of like, Sergio s whole story seems totally fishy. Right? You get together. It s clear you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">to be dating. He s very nice and charming when you re together, but doesn t want to tell anybody. He sometimes mysteriously disappears or is inconsistent in how he communicates and then like, kind of pops up and is charming again. [8:22] It s sketchy. And it s not the same thing, but it s a bit reminiscent <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">of Franklin. (ph) And I mean, you know all that. And then like, but there s a parallel thing that happens or that you sort of do to me where like, with , Sergio or last week or with Lucas, you keep me in the dark. Like, you don t tell me what s going on. I appreciate it and I m sure that it s part of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">what you said, that you feel ashamed or you felt that it was going to be a waste of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562518\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Or, I know it s a bad decision, so-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What s the point in talking about it. I already know it s a bad decision. [9:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: It s just going to make you know that I m consciously making idiotic decisions that make me unhappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I see. But the fact of it is that you re actually keeping me in the dark about what s going on with you. Like yeah, what s going on in your life. What s going on with these guys? There s a similar kind of deceptive thing or a vaguely parallel deceptive thing to what they re doing to you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">[10:30] And then yesterday. So we had agreed on Monday that you would let me know sort of middle of the day both how you were doing and what you thought about today, and you didn t. And I thought, it was like, hmm. You know, like I know you had a busy week. I know you have three conferences. (inaudible at 11:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: No, I forgot to or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right. So it s interesting. It also seems to fit this parallel, I think. And I also think it s like, some way you re doing to me what they re doing to you. I don t know what to make of it yet, but it seems relevant and there. That is something to think about. Here are some things I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">imagine. [12:14] I don t know. There are a bunch of things I could imagine, but I d rather actually not imagine them right now. I d rather figure out what s actually going on. I don t know. What are your thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I don t know. [13:12] I mean, that I don t tell you stuff because I don t want you to tell me to stop or something? I don t know. I don t know. I guess I don t have any thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I think the things that occur to me are like, are you doing this to sort of see how I deal with it? Like, because it s something that you have a really hard time knowing how to handle? Is it that you re mad at these guys for how they re treating you and you re taking it out on me? Is it that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">you re kind of offloading some of the kind of helplessness or frustration that you feel onto me by keeping me in the dark when things are going on with you? I don t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I don t know. [14:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I guess one thing that s clear is that in your version of things, I at some level in your mind, though I won t come out and say it, must think you re doing idiotic things. And that you actually know better, but you do them anyway. And I m going to be, I don t know, critical and maybe sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">of stuck or I m ready to throw my hands up if you keep doing those things. Certainly, wouldn t be able to see the reasons why you would keep seeing Sergio, for example?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. [15:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That was clear. I m not saying that s where I m coming from, but it seems you re pretty you have a strong impression that that s really what I m going to think. Which we know. It s also probably what you think. But still, I think you see it as my reaction to-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Which actually isn t. Like, I don t know for example, why you have continued to see Sergio. I could imagine 100 reasons again.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562518\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Because he s nice, and I have nobody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: That s one. [16:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: It s the main one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I mean, another one could be that there is some reason that you are drawn to guys who do stuff like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: And I would have no idea how to figure out why I m drawn to guys who do stuff like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right. And I m not saying I know that that s it. I don t. But I m really not sure, not only because he s charming and when you re together, it sounds like it s pretty fun. Maybe fun s not the right word. But like, he s attractive, he s charming. You have a good time together. [17:26] I don t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">know. It seems to me I have the impression that you are someone sitting there feeling like she s giving a lecture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Kind of. I don t really question. I don t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe you feel like I m calling you out the way you called Franklin out. Like, some small echo of that. You re not telling me what s going on and all these things, and you were supposed to call me yesterday, and you didn t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don t know. [18:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Okay. Maybe it feels really shaming for me to make this parallel with what s going on in your life and what s going on here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: [19:24] I think you would feel, if you were taking some of this out on me in this way that that was probably the main thing you were doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: If you think back, it happens all the time in therapy that maybe it still feels like what the fuck am I doing once again. Here s another situation where I m doing something stupid or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Right. Or maybe it s just that like, I don t know. That nice guys don t want choose me or like, want me. So I get just like, the assholes. Or like, the selfish ones or whatever. [20:33] (pause) [21:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: I guess that s something you re really worried about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: And that I don t deserve a guy that s really going to be good to me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: For a good reason, or there s something inherent in your or you don t deserve that the way other people do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: I guess. I don t know. [22:37] (pause) [24:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Well, here s another possibility. Maybe you ve sort of this thing where you feel like in a relationship one person kind of has to not be treating the other person well. I m thinking of we know examples where you ve been on that side of it. But then I get to also thinking about guys that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">you ve been out with that you ve been really critical of. And I m not saying you actually treated them badly, but in a way you could say in your mind you did. You know, if not externally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">And I think that s also a little bit sort of the thing with me. I mean, you are in a way although I know you are not at all thinking about it like this doing the things to me that it has really bothered you for guys to do to you. To keep you in the dark about what s going on about relationships <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">or whatever, things like that. [26:25] And the whole point of all of that, I think, would be I mean, I have a few thoughts on why that might be. The first one is in your history. I mean, obviously in kind of a different way, like you and your dad. You feel often really badly treated by him and in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">a similar kind of way. I mean, not about other relationships, but about like, you know, being selfish. Not caring about what matters to you. Not paying attention to it. All that kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562518\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: It seems in some ways, similar to me. It feels very disrespectful. It feels very kind of self-absorbed on his part. [27:28] Is this holding any water at all for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: I don t know. I mean, I feel I don t tell you things, because I don t want you to point out that I shouldn t be doing them. And maybe that s contributing to why I might be feeling unhappy about all this stuff I come in here talking about being unhappy about. I mean, maybe it s more complicated than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: You don t tell me things because you don t want me to point out how you re doing things that are hurting you, which, okay. And maybe that has some relationship to the other things that are happening. [28:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Right. And so it s like, yeah, of course you feel like shit. Why were you doing things to make yourself feel like shit? Like, we re dealing with people that don t treat you the way that you should be treated or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: I mean, that is certainly what you get from a lot of the people in your life when you tell them. My point being, that would -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Be in keeping? Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Your expectations. I don; know. Maybe there are times it does feel like you get that from me. [29:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I m not aware of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, I think inherently. Some of the things that we talk about just end up proving to me that or something. Or that I m creating my own issues or something like that. I mean, why am I still seeing Sergio if he, you know, has maybe a whole other secret life and family? Because he s nice to me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">and he gives me compliments and we have fun and we like watching the same TV shows and can chat and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Well, and it s there s a backup there which is you haven t found someone else that makes you happier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: That s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: And you often aren t optimistic about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Right. [30:49] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I mean, there are those two things. You haven t and aren t that hopeful about finding what you may want. And there are some good things about seeing Sergio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) [32:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: But I think you only half believe that and you also imagine I only half believe that. And the other thing that you re feel so strongly is that both you and I feel it s a completely stupid thing for you to be doing. It means that you must be in denial about what s really going on with him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">[33:14] So maybe that s sort of a split. Maybe by not telling me, you think because I m off somewhere thinking about that side of it, then you can enjoy the other side of it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don t know. I just feel really down on myself and the choices I make and that I ve made. And just feel like everything s a mistake and I just don t really care about anything. [34:16] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. Okay. So I think this has been clear to me. You re not telling me not really I don t think mostly because you anticipate I m going to be critical of you. Maybe there are some things that I ve said that have felt that way. But I don t think that s mostly it. I think it s more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">like it frees you up from having to think about it. Because on one side, you feel really bad. [35:19] And that s so painful in itself. You feel so awful after feeling down. And there really are, and I actually that makes sense to me like, there really are some good things about like seeing Sergio. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">When you re together you do enjoy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562518\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it s always, you know, on either end of it, it s always well, when am I going to hear from him again or when am I going to see him or what does he actually do all week. But then whenever I hang out with him, I never end up really wanting to talk about any of that stuff or ask him, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">because then I don t want to start a thing. And I just want to be able to enjoy our time and hang out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: But it s stupid, because it s this pretend girlfriend for a day thing. [36:24] Like, whenever it s convenient for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It does seem more like it s sort of a fantasy that you want or like, a vacation is more accurate. A vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: You know, and he s doing things like we re watching HDTV House Hunters and he starts asking what kind of house I would get, and that if we were house shopping he would just let me choose and then he would fix the inside. And then ask me what kind of engagement ring I d want in some conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">in the context of me saying I was helping my friend s boyfriend get a Like, what are you talking about, you know? [37:07] And so I don t know if he s doing that because he actually has thoughts of being with me seriously or if it s just like, this fun game for him that he can be flirtatious and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F2\">not follow through on anything. Or not be serious at all. So yeah, the whole thing is like, completely imaginary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: And it really sucks to be vulnerable to that. It s not necessarily so bad to play it, but to be sort of like, vulnerable to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because then he leaves, and I m like, wow, I m catching feelings. And, you know. I m like, Stephanie, she always says that. She s like, I worry whenever you see him, because then you like, get your hopes up that he s somehow going to be different this time. [38:05] And it s like, the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">thing I did with Franklin for three years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 38:25) crashing down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: All right like, remind me that it s definitely going to go nowhere. (pause) [39:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: I see. I think there probably is also an anger piece. I think there is you re pretty pissed at him. And like, and then here with you being controlling me being in the dark and not knowing, that you kind of flipped that around. And I don t know that it feels all that great for you. But I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">that s one aspect of it, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think it is, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: [40:19] And of course, you felt pissed off and helpless I imagine to him. And of course, I have to like, stay underground because otherwise it would kill hanging out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Then we would get in a fight. And we ve had the conversation and argument on and off and back and forth. And then I get confused, because he keeps wanting to see me. You know, and we have had this fight and then I ll disappear for a few months or when I was Lucas and he didn t know about it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">so then I wound up seeing him, because I was seeing Lucas. And he still was calling and trying to see me and whatever. [41:31] So then I like, it gets blurry for me, because then I m, he still wants to see me, so maybe there s something there, you know.
