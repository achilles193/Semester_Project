It is not in your hands anymore. [Chuckles] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">You didn\u2019t know you were supposed to do anything differently, and then he comes along and acts in a way that, I think, makes \u2013 yeah, it makes you feel like you\u2019re doing something wrong or you\u2019re too slow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">And I guess \u2013 sorry, go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I think that, [pauses for five seconds] uh, [pauses for five seconds] there are [clears throat] reasons to think that [clears throat] some of that may be a kind of susceptibility on your part, to feeling like things are your fault. [Pauses for five seconds] I guess what I have in mind is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">that, as you said, you describe it to me, it doesn\u2019t sound as though he is particularly blaming you. Clearly, he is frustrated \u2013 no question about that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: \u2026And he wants things to be different, but I\u2019m not hearing him say anything specifically directed at you, or explicit about finding fault with you. And you say he does kind of do this to everybody, which I guess makes me think a little bit that he is not sort of singling you out in some way <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">or necessarily imagining this is a pattern of yours. So [pauses] I get that you very much feel like he is saying it is your fault, that you\u2019re kind of screwing up, and then, in light of how unfair that is, you get really mad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">[Silence from 00:08:07 to 00:08:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know.
