No, it really wasn\u2019t. Anyway. I hate being late. Really hate it. (Chuckles) Sort of a long week. Yeah. Ended up having to go in on Wednesday. Not until like 11:00 or so, but I went in and then yesterday I was there for 12 hours. Like 7:30 in the morning, there until <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">7:30 (ph). Yeah. And I\u2019m sick again. (Laughs) Fucking kids. So I\u2019m feeling pretty sorry for myself right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">But I got a new tutoring job last night. Like a kid who got an incomplete into his high school diploma and needed 30 hours in World Religion so, \u201cSure.\u201d (Laughs) (inaudible at 00:01:51) Yeah. I\u2019m going to actually like work hard to keep the prep time at a manageable amount. I think it\u2019s going to set <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">aside a couple free hours a week and be like, \u201cThis is the time I have to prepare and if I don\u2019t get it done in this time, I\u2019ll just wing it.\u201d See what happens. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Somebody asked me to be on a committee at the church. Yeah. For Christian Formation, which is like religious education for all ages. So something that I care a lot about. I think [it\u2019ll be good] (ph). (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(inaudible at 00:03:37) So far I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve totally missed anything, but I have sort of more meetings or kind of one off (ph) things recently coming up. And I\u2019ve already done the thing where I say that, \u201cYeah. I can meet at this time.\u201d And then reminds me that, \u201cWell actually, we have a dinner <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">engagement then.\u201d So then I have to reschedule. Then it\u2019s another date to not remember. (Pause) That\u2019s never (ph) really been one of my strengths. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: A little tired today. I once again had big plans for what I wanted to do to prepare for the Greek class [that I\u2019m in] (ph)\u2014just didn\u2019t get to it before. Didn\u2019t get to it last weekend, which meant that I could either stay up late last night or get up early this morning, and so I got up early <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and did that and did some of it. Not as much as I wanted to. I\u2019m not very satisfied with myself.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">But I also feel like I\u2019m being more deliberate about saying, \u201cNo. You need this evening to watch silly television.\u201d Yeah. It makes a big difference when I get rest. That is surprising to me and I don\u2019t know why. (Laughs) (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So the tutoring gig is a 10 week commitment and the thing at the church is about 8 weeks. (Pause) I don\u2019t know how realistic it is for me to be\u2014I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be in 8 weeks or 10 weeks. Sort of increasingly seeming like we\u2019ll probably just still be in the same place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Is it just like not hearing back about [places he\u2019s applied?] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I honestly don\u2019t know when I would apply (ph) to anywhere. I know he\u2019s been looking at places for the last week or week and a half. I haven\u2019t seen him working on applications. I\u2019ve seen him working on the stuff for Greg (ph). I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s done a lot of scabbing (ph) out things, but I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">think of any actual applications that he\u2019s actually sent out. (Pause)Which is a little (inaudible at 00:09:15) for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">He had a paper accepted for that. Yeah. It\u2019s been accepted pending revisions and then before he got to the (inaudible at 00:09:37), so that was great.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562268\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">I think it\u2019s one that he wrote the bulk of and that he\u2019s fairly proud of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Is it like a journal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a crappy journal, because I don\u2019t he would be proud of having a paper on a crappy journal. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. He apparently sort of went to the matt (ph) with Greg over\u2014one of the main things that he sort of added to the paper was he did a lot of the stuff on like, \u201cWhat do we think is actually going on here? How do we explain the results that we have, which don\u2019t really lend themselves well to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">explanation?\u201d So a lot of that ended up being sort of necessarily speculative and Greg objected to that, and James, \u201cIt\u2019s fine to have speculative stuff as long as we say that it is.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">That seems to have been looked favorably upon by the reviewer, so was happy about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Good. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: That\u2019s very James. (Laughs) (Pause) We\u2019re going to dinner with one of his collaborators, who\u2019s sort of\u2014the guy who\u2019s living in Denver, retired from University of Denver, has lab space at Brown, calls James every couple of days and talks for 45 minutes to get across like five minutes of information. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">I think he\u2019s a little crazy. He really likes James though, which most people do. Or people like him really like James. I think people sort of want to be James\u2019s mentor because he gives them hope for the future of the world in some ways. He\u2019s just like very upstanding person, very sensible, and good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">at listening and also has his own ideas, but is good at not being an ass hole about them. I don\u2019t know.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">It\u2019s just funny. (inaudible at 00:13:23) I can\u2019t be but so frustrated with him. (Laughs) Yeah, [it\u2019s just been ten years to] (ph) (inaudible at 00:14:10).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Sorry. This\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: This waiting for him to make any kind of a move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Feel like he\u2019s, in a way, really leaving you hanging. I also (inaudible at 00:14:31) why you, one reason you probably don\u2019t like being late. Because you feel like you\u2019re doing that to another person or other people? They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t know where you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I guess so. I don\u2019t mind when other people are late with me most of the time, but I don\u2019t know. I just used to catch so much crap for it. I was just constantly in trouble for it, for being late. See, I don\u2019t know. It feels like just an instinctive thing of like, I\u2019m just afraid people will be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">mad at me if I\u2019m late. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I see. You hate it more because of like (inaudible at 00:15:35) that goes along with it? And because of guilt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it doesn\u2019t reflect that well on me, but I feel like it\u2019s definitely about me and not about the other person. Like, I\u2019m not that worried about the other person. I\u2019m worried about like\u2026 Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">It\u2019s like James applying to jobs. I feel like it\u2019s not about me but it really affects me. And so, trying to like be upfront that it affects me but also, not try to make it about me. It\u2019s just a line that I don\u2019t really know how to walk and I tend to air towards just don\u2019t say anything at all and wait <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">for it to resolve itself. Figure out the best time (ph).  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">[Afraid James] (ph) will be mad at me if I push him off (ph). (Pause) Much again I feel like, doesn\u2019t reflect that well on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562268\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: You mean because it doesn\u2019t involve a lot of faith in him in a way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, or faith that it\u2019s not the end of the world if James is angry. It\u2019s okay. (Pause) Yeah. I wish I were better at not walking on egg shells with everybody.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">Or maybe it\u2019s more accurate to say that I feel like I am better at that with most people and particularly with James and particularly in this situation. For whatever reason, I just don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s coming from James. I feel like it\u2019s coming from me. (Pause) Sorry. I just really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">don\u2019t like myself very much today.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You know, you\u2019re being unreasonable, unnecessarily making trouble for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so. I feel like that\u2019s sort of an approximation, but I can\u2019t figure out the closer thing to say (ph). (Pause) Being late (ph) doesn\u2019t really help that, but I always sort of don\u2019t like myself after this Greek class. I like the class. I like it when I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">it. Don\u2019t ever really feel like I am proud after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:33) I think that it\u2019s from probably not feeling the charge of your own life the way you want to be. I don\u2019t mean like that you resent moving somewhere because (ph) James gets a job there. I\u2019m thinking more of like, part of that\u2019s because you don\u2019t know what you want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">do next or where you\u2019d ideally want to be next. And whether the Greek class also maybe is the closest thing in your life right now to the academic stuff you do. I know it\u2019s not the same, but it\u2019s sort of have (inaudible at 00:23:24) you didn\u2019t do well at that and this is just a damn Greek class and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">you can\u2019t get that really right either or not as good as it should be or something like that. And another reflection of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. That makes sense. (Pause) Sorry, it feels really fuzzy for me, like I can\u2019t get a hand on it.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">Yeah, I\u2019m having a hard time with thinking clearly and focusing. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: There are some (inaudible at 00:25:47) get more upsetting and more confusing as we talk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It sort of feels like my thoughts are just kind of like, \u201cNope. We\u2019re not going there.\u201d And just sliding away and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo. I want to be in charge of this process.\u201d And I can\u2019t do it. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">So, with moving\u2014I don\u2019t really know whether I would rather be living here or living somewhere else. But I sort of\u2014I have a general sense of what I\u2019m going to do next if we stay here and I have a general sense of what I\u2019m going to do next if we move. Not so much a plan. The first step of what will then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">become a plan. But I can\u2019t do either of those things until we figure out where we\u2019re going. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">Yeah. And so that\u2019s something that I really don\u2019t feel in charge of my own life. (Pause) (inaudible at 00:28:24) I don\u2019t really know. So when I was still living at home\u2014actually pretty much anytime when I go visit, my family were late as like a group effort. (Laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">I feel like the pattern for me is, I get in trouble being late for being late when I\u2019m late because I was getting a ride from my father, who is always late, or like I had to go with my siblings. We couldn\u2019t get all of us out the door at the same time. And I feel like I\u2019m responsible for all of these <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">things that I can\u2019t control. So then when it\u2019s just me, I feel like there\u2019s no excuse. Like, I should just be able to get it done and I can\u2019t really do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562268\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: We need to actually stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Oh.
