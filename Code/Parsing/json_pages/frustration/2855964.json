So what are you doing? What\u2019s the plan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: She went up to Vermont, and she\u2019ll miss a year of school, but then she\u2019ll come back and go to the 12th grade when she\u2019s 18, or else when she turns 17, if she can come back and do it that way \u2013 even the lady over at the club said she should be able to speak for herself when she\u2019s 16. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">they just kind of shuffled Deborah off to the wrong area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Deborah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. Deborah went over with her to file for these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I guess they filed a 51A, and that was to go down to the Georgia Police Department. Apparently they haven\u2019t done anything about that yet. 51A is verbal abuse, mental abuse, any type of abuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh, towards Darla?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes. This kid\u2019s been sick since Tuesday, or Monday, was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what ended up happening? When did we talk, Monday or Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s happened since then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Well as I said, she was so bad on the phone, we just took up the phone, took the phone from her hand and just hung up. He hasn\u2019t bothered to try back calling her, and they put her phone back on. He says, \u201cThat won\u2019t last long.\u201d He says when he goes to the airport \u2013 we said, we know you were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">going to send him into the airport.  I\u2019ll just say she\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know where the hell she is, Mitch. She\u2019s gone. What can I say, you know? I mean, she did make friends up in Vermont, that they live right up the street from us in Cheshire. I could just say she was going over to her friend\u2019s house, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">Rose\u2019s, and she hasn\u2019t come back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well that will get the police over, unless he decides to just let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I mean, I think when she\u2019s 17 they\u2019re not going to bother to look at \u2013 they\u2019re not going to consider her a runaway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: When does she turn 17? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: August 12th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So when she\u2019s 17 she\u2019s legally okay to move, to be back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I believe so. Deborah\u2019s got all that information down. The less I know, the better off I am, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Okay, and where\u2019s Deborah? Is she not with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, she\u2019s with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Darla\u2019s gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Do you know what the plan is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. Right now she\u2019s at my cousin Mary\u2019s, and then from my cousin Mary\u2019s, she\u2019ll be picked up tomorrow and go up to New Hampshire again, and stay up there. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m never going to see her, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Okay.  (inaudible). What do you think of all this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s beautiful, you know? I mean the kid has not had one anxiety attack the whole time she\u2019s been up at my house until she talked to her father on the phone. That\u2019s what pushed it, and all I could hear from him \u2013 she was talking to him on the phone, so I picked up the other phone and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">listened in. All I could hear him say was, \u201cI paid $1,400.00 for you to go in that place. I paid for this. I paid for this. I paid for your education all these years. I paid for your clothing, and all this stuff.\u201d  I felt like saying, how many fucking times she came up here she had a fucking empty suitcase, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200452\">and I filled it and sent her back with it, you know? I kept my mouth shut. \u201cYou\u2019re going to abandon your family down here. You\u2019re abandoning your father, your stepmother,\u201d \u2013 he called her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855964\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">She goes, \u201cOne moment. You got that wrong. She\u2019s not my stepmother. She\u2019s your girlfriend.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat about your half-brother Luke?\u201d She says, \u201cI can write to him. I can talk to him. When I come down to visit I\u2019ll see him, but I\u2019m not coming home to live.\u201d \u201cWell I think you should face up to all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">your things you\u2019ve done wrong. You brought this all on by yourself.\u201d  Darla says, \u201cDaddy, haven\u2019t you been listening? I have been asking you for help for two years and you never fucking lent me the help.\u201d She was saying fuck this and fuck that. Oh, my kind of kid. Right back to her father. So she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">shaking like a leaf. She was crying. She went through a box of Kleenex. I was rubbing her back. It was like, this kid, evidently he doesn\u2019t show any affection to her, doesn\u2019t do anything alone with her anymore, because he doesn\u2019t have time, all because it\u2019s work, work, work, and all Eileen does is work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200473\">work, work, so those kids are left home alone to fend for themselves, and Eileen\u2019s two daughters go with their real father, every weekend, the holidays, all that stuff. He\u2019s got to watch (inaudible) Darla and James. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Those are his two responsibilities. The other two aren\u2019t his responsibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Wow. So yeah, this is so much to get my head around here. I\u2019m also remembering back to our conversation before my vacation about Deborah and your concerns. What kind of went on after that when she\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: She\u2019s very good with Darla and she\u2019s more or less very protective right now. When Darla\u2019s crying on the phone, Deborah starts crying, because she gets all upset that Darla\u2019s upset. Even Neal was there and he was crying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a very upsetting thing between her and her father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Deborah has been up to Vermont with Darla. The first time they went, it was four days they went up, then maybe four days the last time, and Darla stayed a week the last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I remember you being sort of really worried about what was going on between the two of them and the Percosets and all that. How did all that \u2013 when they came home, what happened? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: They were home before it even happened. It happened before, that Deborah had stolen the pills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: She was away and you were thinking about saying you were going to kick her out. What happened there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well I cannot kick her out with Darla there. It\u2019s kind of hard. She\u2019s been really doting on Darla, so I\u2019ll have to give her credit for that. Maybe she couldn\u2019t deal with Darla when she was an infant, but she can deal with her now that she\u2019s a grownup. Darla says to her father, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">not a child anymore, dad. I\u2019m grownup. I can think on my own. I\u2019m pretty smart, if you haven\u2019t realized that,\u201d she says, \u201cwith all my As I get and how I\u2019m in so many advanced college classes.  She says, \u201cAll I have to take in high school is four courses. So she says, \u201cI can talk (inaudible).\u201d She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B2\">very intelligent, knows what she wants out of life, she does want to go back to school, she wants to go to college. She wants to go to Lesley College, where if you\u2019re a Cheshire resident, you get a $10,000.00, because they like to keep it going with the children in Cheshire, rather than seeing you go <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B3\">to New Mexico, or Amherst, anywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855964\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: So what do you think? If she stays up here, is that something you\u2019re going to let Deborah figure out between the two of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Deborah will have to get a two room apartment. Deborah\u2019s going to have to get a job. She realizes that. There\u2019s a lot going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Of course you know Naomi doesn\u2019t mind having her around. Naomi loves it when Darla\u2019s around, but we\u2019re not going to keep her at Naomi\u2019s. We\u2019re keeping her somewhere else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Why, because you think they\u2019ll come looking for her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. They can go through my computer, whatever, my phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re going to find her, Louise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: If they don\u2019t find her, you guys are going to get in some trouble here, really. This is going to not be good. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be good for Darla to do it. Something\u2019s cooking between her and her dad and that is really clear, when she\u2019s saying \u201cI want to kill myself if I have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">go back.\u201d That\u2019s a sign something is really going wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Of course Heath will never say he\u2019s at fault. I don\u2019t think I should have to force her, literally drag her onto that plane, have her tied in, have the stewardess sit next to her so she doesn\u2019t disappear, so she gets on that plane and into Georgia with him there picking her up. No. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s something that does not sound like the best way to go about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for Heath to say she has to come back home and face her problems that she started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right. That\u2019s not going to be the answer, the way to handle this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I mean, you know, he can\u2019t do anything until what, 24 hours, 48 hours? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: When is she due back? Tomorrow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Darla?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: She\u2019s not coming back to my house at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: When is she due back to Georgia?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Tonight, 9:30 tonight her plane is supposed to be leaving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: He plane\u2019s going to be leaving tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: At the airport. So I have between now and 9:30 to think of something to tell Heath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well I can tell you the way I think this might very well shake out is that they will start pulling people into the police station and asking questions. They\u2019re good at what they do. They figure out -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well nobody in the building knows where she\u2019s going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I tell you, that\u2019s one way to go about it, and maybe you can hold up under intense questioning.  This is all they do for a living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re good at it, and they\u2019re good at finding out where people are. Maybe that\u2019s a good thing for them to kind of you guys are doing this out of some place of real concern for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: I shouldn\u2019t have to talk to (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: The problem with it is, Louise, the person that ends up on the side of doing something like this ends up being the bad guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Heath looks like the good guy. He\u2019s got the daughter taken away from him. They tend not to look at the people who did the quote unquote \u201ccriminal act.\u201d That\u2019s the key problem here with the plan.

Let\u2019s get the kid\u2019s welfare in mind. Also it\u2019s going to protect you, and Deborah, and Darla, and you are taking steps to make sure you look like you\u2019re doing the right thing, which you\u2019re wanting to do. You\u2019re wanting to get her \u2013 at the end of the day, she needs help, and I totally understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201112\">the impulse to just keep her from Heath and this being one way, but I don\u2019t think Heath \u2013 I mean, who knows? I don\u2019t know anything about these situations, but it seems to me that you\u2019re trying to act \u2013 he gave permission for you to see her. He trusts you with her. You\u2019re saying you\u2019re concerned about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201113\">her welfare if she comes back. She\u2019s told you that much. We need to figure out something else.

I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but it sure as heck would seem like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201211\">something that you\u2019re trying to figure out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: I mean I could go to the Cheshire Police Station and ask them what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: Of course.
