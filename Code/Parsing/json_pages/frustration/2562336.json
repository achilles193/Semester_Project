(pause) So I\u2019m sort of like dramatically up and down. I\u2019m just like so happy that Candace is here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: And at the same time, it\u2019s just been an awful week. (chuckles) So it\u2019s like just like exhausting. I worked on Monday afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: And both on Wednesday and Thursday. Like Kim [ph] and Frank are both really, really overworked so they were both at least an hour late coming back, coming home, for Wednesday and Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So I\u2019m just dead tired and, you know, sad and all of that.

That\u2019s really wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like Candace is having a tough time. (pause) She\u2019s not really sure where her life is and where her life is going, and she has been really sad. So we\u2019ve been talking about that some. It\u2019s just good to see her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: We just met Noel Sanders [ph] who is a friend who went to William &amp; Mary with us, who has been living in Denver for the last two years, but I haven\u2019t seen him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">I don\u2019t remember the last time I saw him. I think I saw him like I think I saw him the last time Candace visited Denver, like almost a year ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And I might have seen him once since then, but like that is one of the things that got erased, like gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. But he is just delightful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I sort of my emotions about him sort of swing violently back and forth. Like we have a catchphrase for him which is \u201cNoel Sanders [ph] ruins everything.\u201d (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t remember much about him, but I vaguely remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: I guess that\u2019s probably the problem with catchphrases. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: So like we came up with that because first, like Candace was completely in love with him for her first year at William &amp; Mary, and he didn\u2019t like handle it very well or like he didn\u2019t reciprocate her affections but wasn\u2019t very clear about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">So it was there was sort of awkwardness there. And then he broke her foot playing basketball, and I think there were other things too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. Seeing him again after not seeing him for a long time was like \u201cWow, you\u2019re a really smart and passionate and compassionate person. Like it\u2019s really nice to talk to you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to try to be in touch with him more. (pause) Candace came to my Greek class today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT: It was a good one. We finally talked about verbs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure that that is going to last beyond the next couple of weeks. I think we might do I think it might be time to sort of wrap it up until the fall. Partly because I would need to like finding a time that we can all meet has become after the next couple of weeks is going to be difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">CLIENT: And partly I think I think they sort of like the idea of breaking for the summer, at least I think so. We might give it a rest and see if we want to come back to it or not. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562336\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">I don\u2019t know.

There are other things that I\u2019m good at and other things I can do that aren\u2019t part of my life right now, and I would really like them to be. (pause) James, I think, was also really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">glad to see her. You know, he was sort of like \u201cWell, yeah, I\u2019m happy to have Candace come\u201d blah blah blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: And then apparently he and Candace just talked all day on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, that was really nice to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s great.

Like one of them is this 70-year-old woman and this other is this guy who works downtown. Both of them are very smart. And to me it\u2019s sort of the most natural thing in the world that like they would want to learn Greek and like do this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N202331\">with their days. But, you know, it\u2019s a big church and there are two people who are doing it. It\u2019s hard to do. I don\u2019t know.
