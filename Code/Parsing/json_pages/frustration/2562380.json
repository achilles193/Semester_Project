Other than there\u2019s no money coming in. I\u2019m making it. I\u2019m getting clients every day, you know. Or at least, I think there\u2019s just going to be the kind of people that come in. I send them the engagement letter like, for an estate plan. And some are going to do it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">and some aren\u2019t, you know. And I\u2019m finding that tenants aren\u2019t very reliable as far as making appointments and teleconferences. So the way I look at it, is I\u2019m too busy to chase these people down. [1:00] You know, one of it is \u2013 one that I\u2019m \u2013 she\u2019s got a great case, and I\u2019m doing it pro bono. And the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">first time, you know, she sends me this panicky e-mail, you know, 45 minutes before the meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s worth coming without the papers before the health department. I was like, that sounds a bit pretextual. I said, you can come without it, Well, by the time I got her e-mail, you know, oh, it\u2019s too late. So we rescheduled for yesterday morning. I don\u2019t care, \u2018cause you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">I\u2019ve got so much to do. It was a situation where I went out of my way to be somewhere and someone didn\u2019t show up. I went to the Somerville office and that happened. [1:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Do lawyers generally not charge if people are a no show?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Well, not a free consultation. And I think that\u2019s the rub there is that it\u2019s a free consultation. I think even if I charged for the consultation, people would still not show. And at least at this point. Even when I went to the Plymouth office and the woman didn\u2019t show up, I was working later <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">than I probably would have, but I was working later than I probably would have. You know. So I really \u2013 like yesterday, you know, the client was supposed to come in today. As you can see, I got gussied up for him. [2:36] You know, he calls me. You know, he\u2019s one of these people who calls multiple times. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">Like, just keeps hanging up and calling. Or leaves a message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I think what\u2019s happening is that people are \u2013 they don\u2019t know that the office number, the cell phone number \u2013 that everything rings to the cell phone number. So they\u2019re calling all my numbers, and not figuring out that they\u2019re getting the same voice-mail message. Whatever. So, I\u2019ll have to get an app <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to control that. So he didn\u2019t come in. This wife, he calls her, is sick. He didn\u2019t have a car, or something like that, which actually was good, because the presale for Soundgarden was at noon. And when I first logged on, it didn\u2019t seem like there was any tickets available. [3:35] Too high a activity <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">level. Try again later, you know. But since he wasn\u2019t there, you know, I was doing a little work and hitting refresh and boom, two tickets pop up. I didn\u2019t see Soundgarden. I actually had tickets, but I didn\u2019t go see them when they got sort of on their reunion tour. They\u2019ve always been a favorite of mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Is yourDo you have music on your phone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. You\u2019ve got eagle-like hearing. Sorry about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: But anyways, things are going okay other than just the rate at which money\u2019s coming in. I\u2019m at a closing tomorrow and the seller\u2019s attorney\u2019s a schlub and fucked everything up and just, you know, is looking for every excuse not to do things and push things through. [4:37] And you know, git \u2018er <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">done. You know, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019ll close. I know the people will be upset, but you know. I think we\u2019ll close tomorrow. I\u2019m kind of interjecting. But it\u2019s like \u2013 There was a slight delay because of me. He sent me the documents, and basically, probably five business days before I actually looked at them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">And when I looked at them I noticed that, number one, all of a sudden there\u2019s a power of attorney in the picture. And part of the property\u2019s in an IRA and stuff, and so you\u2019ve got to get the custodian to sign off. And they give someone \u2013 They\u2019re an LLC, so they give this woman power of attorney. [5:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: The custodian?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: The custodian does. And I\u2019m noticing on their certificate from the secretary of state in Delaware that the names, while similar, don\u2019t exactly match. There was a shortening in the last deed filed. They\u2019ve already gone and gotten the deed signed. And, you know, someone who does a lot of real <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">estate and prepares deeds is you do all the information you need on the first page, signatures on the second. So if you need to make a major change, you just change the first page. A very common practice. Well of course, this guy doesn\u2019t do that. And I notice that \u2013 So it\u2019s an LLC. I\u2019ve got to run and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">make some checks on the NH Web site and that they\u2019re not registered in NH. [6:28] As far as the laws and the title standards I know, you can\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s doing business in New Hampshire, and we\u2019ve got some sort of problem here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">So I sent it off to the title company. He comes back with a laundry list of stuff. And probably the one thing I didn\u2019t pick up was the notary, was the corporations of the person that said we notarize the LLC. You can\u2019t notarize the \u2013 It has to be a person, you know. The woman signing on behalf of. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">you\u2019ve got to put \u2013 You know it\u2019s comma, self-directed IRA, LLC, also known as comma, that\u2019s C-A-M-A, S-D-I-R-A, LLC. You know, and you\u2019ve got to put that on signature lines, you know. And there\u2019s an affidavit that the power of attorney, the attorney in fact, needs to sign. [7:33] And when I told this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">attorney that, he asked me what it was, which made very clear \u2013 Now, the weird thing is that I Googled -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: He asked what the affidavit was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Right. And I Googled him. And years ago, he\u2019s in East Manchester. Years ago, I\u2019m talking a long time ago, he got in trouble for screwing up some closings and not paying people\u2019s taxes and kept screwing it up, you know. So I thought this guy did a good amount of real estate. But he doesn\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">what this affidavit is, which is very common. But no one\u2019s told him about it. Because we\u2019ve got to record the power of attorney. And we\u2019ve got to record the affidavit from the attorney in fact, saying that to the best of their knowledge, it hasn\u2019t been revoked, and that the principle\u2019s not dead, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">it\u2019s an LLC or whatever. [8:25] So, you know, normally, I\u2019d just be freaking out. I think it will ultimately come through. If it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s very clear \u2013 I\u2019ve kept good contact with my mortgage guy, you know. Saw his attorney. He\u2019s in court all day and then, you know, we were originally <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200273\">supposed to close on the 13th. On the 12th, I\u2019m like, where\u2019s the final water, you know, which he said he was going to send me several days earlier. I\u2019m working on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">We finally get the final water on Friday, you know, the day after the original closing. Had to move it back, because there was some work they didn\u2019t finish. And my clients are freaking out. They\u2019re just \u2013 this is never going to happen. You know, they set things up and they take work off. [9:30] And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">they make a bigger deal of it than it really is. But people panic. And I\u2019ve got another closing Friday. I think ultimately, you know, I\u2019ve got some cases rolling in that, you know, will start having some money. I am taking some cases where people are paying me small amounts, you know, which I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">getting them to even pay the small amounts. That\u2019s a little frustrating, because I think \u2013 people say oh, I\u2019m going to send a $150 check, and then you send them an e-mail and they won\u2019t respond, because they feel like either they\u2019ll be billed for it, or that because they haven\u2019t paid the money, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200293\">know. And it\u2019s like, we\u2019re on a schedule here for the litigation. I need you guys to cooperate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">I need you guys coming up with the meat, you know. I need you to sign this waiver of \u2013 or the disclosed joint representation. I can\u2019t get them to do it. Now I know why you\u2019re getting divorced. [10:34] You know, why they didn\u2019t renew your lease. But once again, I\u2019m not, you know. Ian was driving me a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">little crazy, but I think I handled it okay. He spilled large glasses of lemonade. First, he spilled it at S&amp;S. And he\u2019s been on the glass for a couple of years. He\u2019s just not paying attention. Like, you pay attention. Two hands. So then he\u2019s holding it on the table. And of course, who knows what the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B2\">other waitress is thinking. You know, thank God we already got our food. And Ian is now in that spitball kind of thing. He didn\u2019t\u2019 have a spitball, but he was blowing air on Lucille who, in her attempt to avoid the air, did a one-and-a-half rear somersault pike position, land flat on her back off the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B3\">booster seat into the middle of the restaurant. And I\u2019m like, dude. At first it didn\u2019t set in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">I was so kind of \u2013 some of that hadn\u2019t happened in a long time where I was upset to the point that several seconds later I could not remember \u2013 I felt first that he pushed her. I\u2019m like, you pushed her. He said, I didn\u2019t push her. I just blew. [12:18] I was going to let him get a Boston cream pie and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">we\u2019ll split it, you know. And so we had a good time. They had a bath and a little bit of \u2013 I get upset with both kids when \u2013 just normal playing stuff. I wasn\u2019t anxious or overwhelmed or anything like that. Then we went skating and Ian comes out. He wants a donut. I said, but you had Boston cream pie <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">last night. He\u2019s like, no I didn\u2019t. I said, well you were supposed to, right? He\u2019s like, yeah. I said, you were punished. He said, yeah. I should be able to get a donut. I\u2019m like, no. If you had not been punished \u2013 Well, he didn\u2019t follow and Jess didn\u2019t follow. And I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s no big deal. [13:20] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D3\">But the feeling I\u2019ve been noticing lately that I don\u2019t think \u2013 For instance, I didn\u2019t see the kids yesterday. But I\u2019m feeling like I want to see the kids. I miss them, and things like that, which is kind of new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: And when Jess did it the right way and drove the kids and Lucille gets out of the car, I don\u2019t want to stay, I don\u2019t want to stay. Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy. Take her upstairs. Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy. Put her on the couch. Tell her to take off her coat. She takes off her coat. Boom. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">fine. And Jess dropped her off like the parenting coordinator had said to do the last time, the same thing would have probably happened. There\u2019s usually one either in the evening or the morning where she\u2019s momma, momma. Do you want a bubby (ph)? Okay. It\u2019s getting much better. [14:26] You know, there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">a separation anxiety specialist. But after this weekend, I think it\u2019s just normal behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: It sounds logical. She spends more time with her mom and, you know, it\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: And Jess, you know, over \u2013 not over protected her, but she over-nurtures, you know, if that\u2019s possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Separation anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: So yeah. Separation anxiety. And Ian has it. He gets it from Lucille who has it from him. They\u2019re stuck together all the time. But I\u2019ve got Marcia -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: She settles down after Jess leaves, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And we have fun. But she\u2019s always like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: There are kids who like, keep screaming and crying for hours when one parent leaves. [15:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Well, that was why the first time was so frustrating, \u2018cause you know, the tantrums. And Jess\u2019 blaming it on the screens and the TVs and the phones. And, you know, she\u2019s got to find a cause and effect for everything. It just can\u2019t \u2013 Things don\u2019t happen naturally in her world. Anything that rocks <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">the boat is not normal and can be solved. Her mom\u2019s the same way. Everything\u2019s got to be solved, which is fine, because I don\u2019t want them to use my phone, because they fuck it up. And I like to have it. Which on a Friday night, I\u2019m still doing business until 6:00, 6:30, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">But they will respond. And I tell them they can play in the morning and let them play in the morning. [16:16] And they do watch a lot of TV. You know, I\u2019ve got this rule that it\u2019s their toys and if they want to take it home, they can take it home. They can bring it over. Stella brings some stuffed animals <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">back and forth. I bought her this cool little dress-up Hello Kitty game and she took it home. The games that I get her she kind of takes home, not that she plays them for very long. But I think now I\u2019ve just got to go out and get toys and say okay, these are the house toys. You know, these aren\u2019t a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">gift for you. These are my toys. If you want to play my Candy Land, you can, but you can\u2019t take my Candy Land home. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: And that fits in with letting them take their toys wherever? I just want there to be stuff for us to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s like, these are mine. But letting them know there are some toys that are going to stay at daddy\u2019s house, so they\u2019re here every time you come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: I mean, they\u2019re good with the books. She likes the (inaudible due to simultaneous dialogue at 17:30).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Some toys you can bring back and forth, but there are some toys that I always want to make sure are here when you\u2019re here. [17:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: I had to leave them short at hockey, because I had my G license course for youth soccer. That\u2019s the lowest level license for coaching. And you get an hour and a half of classroom time, which really sucked, because you\u2019ve got an egotistical soccer God. He kept saying he was. And then you\u2019ve got <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">all these other people, the European, the this, that, the other, and everybody\u2019s got to put their say in. And he\u2019s like listen, you can do what I say or not do what I say. But this is what I\u2019m saying to do. The thing is for youth six, passing\u2019s useless. Well, thanks for wiping it up. Youth 7, my guys <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F2\">are great passers now. [18:30] But the thing is that, even at \u2013 the reason my guys are great passers is that we had a practice at 4:00. And we did a couple of drills and this other scrimmage, so we got two on two. All four are at different levels. I said okay, you guys have to pass the ball three times <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F3\">before you can score.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a great idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve had coaches come up to me \u2013 and so now we\u2019ve started doing that every scrimmage. And I have coaches coming up to me saying, you know, your team passes really well. You know, of course, their team crushed. One of the things about passing is that passing is a lesser skill to some degree. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">There are players yes, who specialize in passing. But their ball skills \u2013 they\u2019re trying to develop their ball skills at this age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">THERAPIST: You mean like, dribbling something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes. Exactly. Because even to get to the position to make the pass, they\u2019ve got to be able to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">THERAPIST: Right. They\u2019ve got be able to get ball and run with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right. And I believe in this and I understand it, but these other people who are like, old school soccer and from Spain or wherever the fuck they\u2019re from. You know, they can\u2019t accept it. [19:42] But this is what they\u2019re doing. You know, and then they quote the clubs like Arsenal and, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">they got the kids in there this young. They hand choose the good ones. But we\u2019re following their practices. So these people are arguing for the European way and it\u2019s like, this kind of is the European way. So we did the hour and a half, which I felt was very helpful. And then we go and, they run you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B2\">though drills like you\u2019re the kids. And I\u2019ve done this in very short, you know, the short sessions or whatever. But we basically played variations of tag with and without a soccer ball. You know, grown men and women for like, 45-50 minutes. And everybody had a fucking ball. I mean, the smiles on everyone\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B3\">faces. The little, you know, red light\/green light. And you throw in like, a purple light. And on purple light, you stop the ball. [20:44] You know, blue light. I always liked the one where they just fall to the ground. This one, you had to like, sit on the ball. You know, we\u2019re doing stuff like that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B4\">and you\u2019ve got to tag someone on the shoulder, tag them on the back. You know, and it\u2019s really kind of showing how to get them to use the skills and sort of discover how to use the skills and not realize that they\u2019re actually playing an activity. They don\u2019t call us coaches, they call us activity leaders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">So that was fun, but man, I got my ass kicked. I was so out of shape. But I decided to just keep going, keep going. But literally like, an hour afterwards, my quads were killing me. I was very slow through the evening. I was quiet. And Marcia seemed understanding, I think because I was able to explain <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">it, because I wore myself out. But, you know, we went and saw a friend of ours play guitar. [21:52] You know, we hung out and she even said to some people, he\u2019s not feeling good or whatever. When we were trying to leave I got a little upset, because she still had a drink and she\u2019s just a chatterbox.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">It\u2019s like, Brockton is this crazy little \u2013 just everyone knows everybody, and oh, my God. And her really good friend \u2013 in fact, this is kind of the connection sort of indirectly, how I know her is this guy Carlton is friends with Karl. Uncle Mosby (ph). That\u2019s how Uncle Mosby knows Marcia and how Marcia <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">went to work for Amy and Mosby. And Booty invites me to a show. [22:42] So this guy Carlton, who is the nicest guy, really nice guy. But he\u2019s got some bad habits. And I guess \u2013 he said he was just really drunk. He gets pulled over by the cops and he\u2019s got all this stuff in the car. So he gets out and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F2\">starts going to the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">THERAPIST: Stuff like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: Drugs, you know. So he starts going towards the cop which, of course, they immediately cuff him. You know, he\u2019s leaving the car. There\u2019s something going on. And it was nothing. You know, he had \u2013 It\u2019s funny, because you read the police report and you release the very embarrassing article in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">the Brockton Times. And these people, everybody knows everybody. Fathers were calling daughters. You know, your friend Steve, you know. [23:34] You know, it\u2019s Class A, Class C, Class D, Class A with intent. He had two ounces of marijuana, which, that\u2019s over the ounce. He had a scale and baggies and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200632\">$500 cash. And he says that he can prove that he pulled the cash out of the ATM that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">He\u2019s moving, so he\u2019s got all this shit in his car. His mom has a prescription for \u2013 there was morphine and Viagra which, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s got the prescription for that, you know. He was like yeah, just thank God they didn\u2019t say Viagra in the newspaper. So this was a very embarrassing article. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">he ends up showing last \u2013 you know, we went to this bar for a little bit for St. Paddy\u2019s Day. And he ends up showing up, you know. [24:33] It\u2019s the right thing, you know. Get it out in the open and don\u2019t hide. He walked in there just like, you know, it was like a victory lap almost. Big smile on his <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">face. Hero come home. Everybody\u2019s shaking his hands and whatever. And I go up to him and I go, Carlton, you know \u2013 He goes, did you see the article. I said, everyone did. He said, yeah it was embarrassing. I go, I can understand how embarrassing it was. Now, everyone knows that you\u2019re 48. Get it? You <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200653\">know, instead of all these bad things about him, they know his age. And he\u2019s trying to sell his house. I go, what great publicity. You know, you got your house number right there in the paper. [25:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I get it. I wasn\u2019t sure at the dramatic pause if you were going to say something about his reaction or something, so I was waiting. No, I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: But the amazing thing is how drunk he claimed to be. They didn\u2019t get him for drinking and driving. Anyways, Brockton is this very tight-knit, you know, for the type of community it is where, you know, it\u2019s really nice houses. You know, there\u2019s some blue collar areas. You know, Watertown gets <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">kind of pulled in there. It\u2019s like, everybody knows everybody. Everybody knows what\u2019s going on. But yeah. So she stops to talk to the guy, the guy who just bought the bar. I said, I\u2019ve got to go. I went out to the car and waited. And instead of \u2013 I made a couple of sort of hints at her not coming very <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200692\">quickly, you know, but not in an angry sort of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">It just kind of blew over. [26:42] But I\u2019m crazy busy. I just wish \u2013 I\u2019d feel a lot better if some of these checks would just start coming in, you know. I was expecting March to be a very big month and at this point, it\u2019s not turning out to be. I am going to have three closings. I\u2019ve already got a couple <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B1\">lined up for April. And this landlord-tenant shit\u2019s just \u2013 A landlord called me. It really sounded like, you know, he was supposed to call me back and didn\u2019t. You know, he may reach out at some point. [27:27] He wants to issue a notice to quit to his tenants for nonpayment of rent, but he doesn\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B2\">them to leave, \u2018cause he needs the money. I was oh, this guy is going to be fun to talk to. So they\u2019re not paying you money, but you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">THERAPIST: But you want them to stay, because you need the money. Yeah, for them to stay and start paying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s kind of not the landlord I want to be representing. You know, I want someone who\u2019s willing to at least go in and work out some agreement if you can\u2019t do it beforehand. I did turn down this newly graduated lawyer, admitted lawyer, whatever. He\u2019s taking the case all the way to trial <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">and wants me to come in and help at trial, \u2018cause I\u2019m so experienced. [28:36] I said, quite frankly, I don\u2019t do trials, because it doesn\u2019t get past mediation and shouldn\u2019t. He was like well, these people are, you know. I go, you know, if you want me to sit there and feed you the law, I can do that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F2\">But to tell you whether to object or anything like that, you know. These are not \u2013 they\u2019re completely formal proceedings. They\u2019re a little more informal. Not quite small claims. You can actually, you know, cross-examine witnesses and whatnot. So I turned that down. Being able to turn things down and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F3\">not really follow up with people, \u2018cause I\u2019m just not interested, it\u2019s nice. I didn\u2019t feel I was in that position before. In a couple instances it got me in trouble. [29:30] The reality is, is to do these things, you kind of need some volume. And that seems to be happening. It\u2019s just a matter of, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F4\">going to take some time before the machine keeps churning the cash cow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great that the work keeps coming in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019ve not been able to follow up with everybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good position to be in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">CLIENT: This may be awful, but you know, there was a guy who called me and I really couldn\u2019t understand anything he said. And he never called me back. I didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m using my headphones now, which makes a huge difference. I\u2019m thinking of getting Bluetooth. I\u2019m not going to wear it all the time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200771\">but in the office or at home. But I don\u2019t want to get a crappy one. I might even do it in the car, but the Bluetooth in the car is not that great. The AC, the engine. [30:52] The roads are so lacking because they\u2019re all fucked up. I don\u2019t think there was any period where, you know, occasionally anxiety, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200772\">but really no \u2013 I felt a little anxious and panicky on Friday with helping her walk the dogs and trying to do stuff in between. We had taken her car in, and so that\u2019s why I was hanging out down there. And then they couldn\u2019t do her car, \u2018cause certain things needed to be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">They wanted her to do it all at once, so we had to go back and pick her up. We got stuck in the traffic for the St. Paddy\u2019s Day parade. And it\u2019s like, now I have to talk to my designer at noon. [31:51] And I just got a little freaky there and I calmed down a little bit. It\u2019s one of these things where <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200791\">it\u2019s like I really need a weekend. I even said to Marcia, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t want to be leaving here at 2:00, because the kids are supposed come over at 4:00. Sure enough, I leave, it\u2019s 2:00. I\u2019d have rather started at before 1:00 to start \u2013 But there\u2019s always one more little thing I\u2019ve got to do. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200792\">always a little something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">And so that was a little frustrating, but I\u2019m kind of accepting it a little more. I\u2019ve got to buy the cabinets for my office. Obviously, I don\u2019t have the money, because nothing is coming in. I\u2019ve got three closings. I\u2019ve got that small claims case. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure they just bill on a frequency <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B1\">thing, so their next billing cycle or whatever. I\u2019ve got all these estate plans hanging out there that no one\u2019s sent any money in. [33:31] I don\u2019t feel comfortable telling people to write a check there at the table. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s something I have to start doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Why does it make you feel uncomfortable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like a hard sell. You know. But I guess it\u2019s not working. They\u2019re not doing it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">THERAPIST: So this is \u2013 you say write it at the table. You mean, after you\u2019ve done the estate plan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">CLIENT: Consultation with them. If you want to hire me, I\u2019m going to need a check. And first of all, I don\u2019t think that meshes with the whole relationship that\u2019s been established over the past hour. But I\u2019m having trouble getting, once I get people to do the engagement letter, either they don\u2019t do it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200831\">or they just send the engagement letter back and no one\u2019s sending me money. I\u2019ve got a handful of these things floating out there. [34:41] Same thing, you know, there\u2019s just a lag time with people like, well, I want to see what happens, you know, I want to figure it out first. I want to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">THERAPIST: My hunch is that it doesn\u2019t feel that it meshes with the relationship, because of what it feels like to you when you\u2019re asking for money. I mean, the relationship is in part about money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">CLIENT: And I tell them, you know, you\u2019ll return the engagement letter with the check, you know. And there\u2019s going to come a time again when this thing is not going to bother me, because I\u2019ll just be on a cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">THERAPIST: You still have the lag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">CLIENT: And the reality is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">THERAPIST: So the people will pay. It\u2019s just a timing thing? [35:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">CLIENT: I think so. I\u2019ve got to be smart about following up with people. You know, you don\u2019t want to nag them. You know this one couple, they had a baby and they send me the signature page of the engagement letter that they accepted, you know, by e-mail and that they\u2019re mailing off the engagement letter <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F1\">and the check and wanted to know if I\u2019d come to Manchester. It just became one of these things that kind of fell down a little bit. And they said that the check was coming. It never came and I never \u2013 that would have been my reminder. And it never came, and I just got buried and buried and buried. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F2\">so she follows up with me, you know. [36:35] Did you get the signature pages and can you come to Manchester. I said, yeah, I can definitely meet you at your home at your convenience in Manchester.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">But I haven\u2019t gotten the \u2013 you were sending the original with the check and I haven\u2019t gotten it yet. And that was a week ago and I haven\u2019t heard from them. And this is one of these things where they don\u2019t want to talk to me because of the money. You know, that was referred to me from soccer. But I definitely <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200911\">\u2013 my foot. Was my foot hurting me last Tuesday? I\u2019ve got that sort of gout thing in my foot again. I kept thinking, I want to work out, I want to work out, but my foot. It was much better. And in fact I started feeling it a little bit in this foot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">THERAPIST: You did okay at the soccer thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">CLIENT: It came back yesterday morning, but now it\u2019s better. [37:50] The encouraging thing for me was that I was able to play for a long period of time. It\u2019s not like I was running at full speed. It was just that maybe I\u2019m in better shape than I think I am. Today\u2019s just like a day where I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200951\">be in the office until 7:00. I\u2019m just not going to have time to do my work out. I\u2019ve got to go to a March madness draft after, so I figured I\u2019d just stay in the office and crank it out instead of going to Andover and going back up to Fairfield. Also an excuse not to drive with my landlord, though I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200952\">am excited to tell him that 10 months from now I\u2019ll be caught up and will be paying on time. [38:53] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen as I\u2019m bitching here that nothing\u2019s coming in, that all of a sudden it\u2019s just going to stop dropping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">THERAPIST: You could add that it also feels good to be getting the work. I get it that it\u2019s frustrating that the money\u2019s not coming in yet and that will mean a bigger boost. But still -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">CLIENT: I\u2019m keeping track. You know, when I talk to someone, I write their name down, the date. If it\u2019s a landlord-tenant, you know what\u2019s the property, are they landlord. Who is the landlord, you know. And that way if they do come into the office I\u2019ve already got something. Also it\u2019s sort of a measuring <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200991\">tool, being able to see based on whoever ultimately hires me and maybe I\u2019ll be able to spot some things and I\u2019m more able to work. [39:56] And at what point, what\u2019s the point of okay, I\u2019m spending too much time I\u2019m not getting business from versus people I am getting from. And I think that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B\">THERAPIST: You might also learn how to talk to people or just get a feel from the people who are likely to follow through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve got to impress upon \u2013 a lot of these people think that I\u2019m just \u2013 You know, it\u2019s funny, because all the tenants complain about that all the tenants know the tricks and they don\u2019t, because I tell them, this is what you\u2019re looking at and they done\u2019 believe me. They just don\u2019t believe me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D1\">And I think a lot of people are just worried about retaliation from their landlord, which I tell them is illegal and it\u2019s just going to get them money and it\u2019s going to pay their attorneys feels. So I think, just like the security deposit law, you know, double damages and attorney\u2019s fees and your landlord\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D2\">done. [41:03] This one woman who, they had a year lease, and then they renewed for a second year, but at the end of the first year, the landlord came though, saw a bunch of damages, fixed them, took it from the security deposit and had her give a new deposit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562380\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F\">Well, the statute\u2019s a little vague, because sometimes it says tenant, sometimes it says occupant. But the courts have made it very clear that when you leave, that it\u2019s the start of the tenancy, even though they\u2019re broken up, the statute says you can only collect at the start. That\u2019s a renewal, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F1\">not a start. Change in terms, you know. So I was like, I can get you both security deposit back, plus if they don\u2019t give them back promptly, I can get you trouble damages and attorney fees. [42:00] And just the thought of \u2013 and I said $225.00. But I\u2019ll ask or that, too. They may not send it. She didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F2\">even want to set an appointment and never showed up. She was questioning me the whole time.
