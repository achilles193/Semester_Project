I will ask her about that shortly. Roughly this time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: 10:30. (client affirms) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: All right. I will ask her tonight. Tonight is date night, so I should remember (therapist affirms) to do these things. Oh, man! I woke up this morning to a very insistent Katy Perry. Wanted to know if I ever felt like a plastic bag drifting through the wind, wanting to start again. It\u2019s one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">of two ringtones I have on my phone. So I can choose one of those two to wake me up, as opposed to one of the standard iPhone clacks and horns or whatever, so... (therapist affirms) I\u2019m a Katy Perry fan, because who wouldn\u2019t be? She has enormous breasts and incredible talent, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Two for two!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Two for two!

(client affirms) Basically, they should have left the floor, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I went home after the third quarter and I was like, \u201cThere is no way. Like, there is just...\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a mathematical impossibility, unless all of a sudden, the Seahawks started playing like the Broncos, for some reason. (therapist affirms) But like, you know, when they got a touchdown <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">in the third quarter, and Seahawks were like, clapping for them like, we just, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Is that right? Were they clapping for them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, there were a couple of like, \u201cYeah, all right!\u201d You know? (therapist chuckles) There was a Seahawk who like, did obvious pass interference and then shoved the guy. As he was walking away, he says, \u201cYeah, no worries! It\u2019s cool! We take it.\u201d (therapist affirms) Yeah, it\u2019s like, \u201cYou can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">have your first down. I\u2019m not really worried.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: They knew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, they had them beat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. It almost felt like, by the first snap of the game, they had them beat, with that safety...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, 12 seconds, fastest score in NFL history. And with the slowmo look on Peyton\u2019s face of absolute horror (therapist chuckles), as he realizes what is happening. It\u2019s like, \u201c(inaudible). What\u2019s going on?\u201d (therapist affirms) You know, and who spikes it over your shoulder? That\u2019s what I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">to know. The guy who like, spike the ball, he\u2019s like, it was like... not spike, um, the guy who, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Oh, who hiked it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Hiked it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: The center?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, so he threw it over his shoulder, off to the right, you know? And it was like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it was, that\u2019s true. It was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: A total (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: He was not only moving in, Peyton was not only moving in and not looking, but the spike would have, I mean, the hike would have been a way off.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563349\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was way off.

Yeah, I mean, after that beginning... And then after all the interceptions he threw, and that punt return and just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I can\u2019t believe...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Places where the guy was in, you know, (inaudible) Duke (ph) shakes three tackles, spins and then evades that other guy. Poor 86, I think was it, trying to take him down. It was like, \u201cI have three shots to take you down, and I failed all three of them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Oh, the Harvin touchdown?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so, yeah. It was like, spin [clicking sound], spin [clicking sound]... brilliant, fucking brilliant football. Bruno Mars, fucking talented individual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Did you like it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, I like him in general. Like, his lyrics suck like, whoever is writing his songs like, he needs another lyricist, you know? But (inaudible) he can dance, he can sing in several different styles, he can emulate several different singers very well, and he\u2019s funny. He did SNL, I mean, he was hilarious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I heard that. I remember he was really good on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so fucking good at that. You know, he\u2019s talking about like... He\u2019s just talking about, it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I never had a chance to get in front of the camera before like this time. I mean, never been asked to like, one black shampoo commercial.\u201d It was ridiculous! Because his hair is, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">know, beautiful, incredible, you know. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d Kenan Thompson was like, \u201cHey, man! I see you\u2019re a little nervous.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what, Kenan, you\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t be working. Not what I said.\u201d (therapist chuckles) \u201cYou know (inaudible), I\u2019m going to be amazing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B2\">Again, I didn\u2019t say that. Amazing.\u201d You know, he shoves him off and he breaks into a song and dance number, it was like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Did he... he hosted it, too? Or was it just the musical...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he hosted it. And he like, these five guys came on and started doing this, you know, background music and stuff, and dancing. He\u2019s dancing through the whole thing. He\u2019s like, \u201cLook at you guys! What they\u2019re doing now, it\u2019s called a Breakdown. Breakdown. It\u2019s a breakdown. Breakdown. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">so good at it!

They do this bit that was on Hulu Plus for a day or two, because they had to get clearance for the rights, but this skit is where he works for Sirius radio. You know, the satellite radio (therapist affirms) and everything? And Austin\u2019s (ph) satellite goes out. People are like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">changing stations and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no! What are we going to do?\u201d So like, \u201cLet\u2019s go get the intern.\u201d The intern starts like, singing songs, or a song comes up...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: He starts singing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: He had to actually do it, he was doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that (inaudible) so good, it\u2019s so good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: And they have him doing Kevin Jackson, starts with \u201cBillie Jean,\u201d kind of, someone skips \u201cBillie Jean.\u201d And everyone\u2019s like, \u201cWho skipped \u2018Billie Jean\u2019? Who skipped \u2018Billie Jean\u2019?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563349\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: What do you mean, they skipped it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Oh, like whoever is play , pushing the buttons or whatever on the radio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. He wanted to turn...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, he was changing the songs, somehow it keeps switching. They have to rush him into... one of Satchmo\u2019s songs, (inaudible) screen (ph), but like as he was (inaudible) to laugh midway through it, and so it doesn\u2019t quite work. Like, Jason Sudeikis is totally rolling, he was like, \u201cNot your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">best, not your best. We\u2019ll get it on the next one.\u201d (chuckles) It totally ruled it, but... it was brilliant. I\u2019ve been rehearsing this interview tomorrow, all week, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what do you have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: (pause) I think good answers. Um... you know, what I\u2019m mostly afraid of is, not afraid... The biggest concern is what happened to your last two jobs. (therapist affirms) I think my answer for that... I\u2019ve never been, I\u2019ve been fired once. I\u2019ve been fired once and laid off once, [] when I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">younger. (sighs) CEO is 29, by the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Of Plebian?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. He\u2019s 29, so... There is another dude there who\u2019s in his 30\u2019s; he\u2019s the old man of the group. So, I think I get to be the old man if I get hired. I figured, fine with me. People start calling me Mr. Reeves again, the reflex (ph) would be fun, so... Uh (sighs), sir. Yes, sir. I\u2019ve gotten <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">a lot of \u201cSir.\u201d He\u2019s got a lot on his plate. This dude who used to work for me still calls me \u201cMr. Reeves.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou don\u2019t work for me. You can call me...\u201d \u201cOh, I prefer Mr. Reeves.\u201d So they already have a good working match (ph), so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Oh, at the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Plebian. So, I\u2019m going to do someone else there (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so what about the two, how are you going...? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: So, well, I think the way I have to phrase it is like, \u201cListen, I\u2019ve left every place I\u2019ve left after long consideration and (inaudible), especially these last two places had high amounts of turnover. I carefully considered my reasons for living (corrects), I mean, for leaving...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: For living! (chuckles) That, too!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a Freudian slip, right there! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: They\u2019ll probably get it at a Plebian accounting place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know, for leaving. Truly, the details I feel comfortable going into. I made an effort (therapist affirms) to fix the issues, the issues were not resolved, and so after careful consideration, I left, you know. (therapist affirms) If you want to know more about that, you should <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">hire me and take me out for some drinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: I mean, I have to say, just, from my standpoint, I sometimes hear you\u2019d be almost apologetic about it, when you shouldn\u2019t. I mean, you went there, and you did what you wanted to do. I think you also felt like you didn\u2019t see a place for you after a certain amount of work had been done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, that\u2019s true. I was like... well, this is boring now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: You should definitely mention that they wanted you to stay and do this other role that (client affirms) you weren\u2019t (inaudible\/blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s true. I was offered a project management job, yeah. He offered me a better job. I didn\u2019t want it (therapist affirms) there. I didn\u2019t want to work in that environment anymore. What was that environment like? Negative. So... you know, it didn\u2019t fit.

And (inaudible) almost told me, she\u2019s like, \u201cThey say if you stare at something for five seconds and intentionally fix it as a memory, you keep it, you know, forever.\u201d I heard this when we were on the beach, so I go over to the window and looked at this sailboat, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">just stared at the sailboat, fixing it in my memory. And it\u2019s still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: What do you mean, \u201cfixing it\u201d? You mean like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: You create a permanent...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: ...(inaudible\/blocked) and lock onto that memory. (therapist affirms) It\u2019s still, it\u2019s still there, I can see that sailboat. That\u2019s what the key is, knowing that you have about 15 minutes before your short-term memory dumps, you know. If you don\u2019t encode within 15 minutes, it\u2019s gone. So... (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201271\">So, but that\u2019s what you do, and that\u2019s the trick. So I won the game! It was great. People think, \u201cOh, So-and-so is stoned, So-and-so will be slow and stupid.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m Willow fucking Reeves. I\u2019m just gifted now.\u201d (pause) And I know the trick. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Whereas, so you kind of have to, dealing with the potential for memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: I know how the drug works, so I have to fix the side effects (therapist affirms). People are like, \u201cWell, look. You\u2019re going to smoke weed, aren\u2019t you worried about this?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a fucking pro at this. Like, I know how to smoke weed and how to be high, you know, so...\u201d Nobody gets <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">stoned that beats their kids, unless they were determined to do so beforehand anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: It does not lead to impulsivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: No, it does not. It does not; in fact, it leads to quite the opposite of that, you know? But it was nice and... So Colbie was there, without her boyfriend, which I\u2019m glad of. I dislike her boyfriend greatly. Yet another man that talks down to her, you know. I\u2019ve been meaning to have this conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">with her, I\u2019m like, \u201cColbie, may I ask you a question that is potentially offensive, infuriating, and might make you very mad at me, and is also quite personal, but to, of which I\u2019m very curious about the answer?\u201d If she says yes, which she will, because they always do, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s very simple: <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F2\">\u201cWhy do you date men that talk down to you? It\u2019s a curious thing.\u201d Obvious first response is, \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t date men who talk down to me.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, we can walk through the evidence, if you\u2019d like, you know.\u201d Because I\u2019ve seen it happen numerous times. Charles and Victor (ph), whom you\u2019ve both <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F3\">dated, still can\u2019t help but take digs at you, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">So what do I do for Colbie? I sit between Colbie and everybody else. I become her surrogate boyfriend of the evening, in that I\u2019m the one who supports her, I\u2019m the one who laughs at her jokes, which are funny, you know. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s like, \u201cNo, actually, that wasn\u2019t the best connection,\u201d you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">I\u2019m honest with her, but at the same time, I\u2019m a buffer. (pause) Because we get along, you know. We sat there, we shared a blanket, you know. We talked throughout the game, whatever. And it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s nice to be a surrogate boyfriend to someone who is more than ten years younger than I am, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201312\">She\u2019s... she\u2019s 26 now? (therapist affirms) Yeah. So 36.5, so that\u2019s 18.5 really is what it is. 18.5 plus 9, 27.5, so 27.5 is the youngest I can date without being creepy. So, apparently that\u2019s the rule someone made up, half your age, plus nine. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20130-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20130-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563349\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">THERAPIST: (pause) I thought it was half your age plus seven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">CLIENT: All right, hey, that\u2019s even better!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: Now you\u2019re in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: That\u2019s even better! Leif (sp) is dating someone who\u2019s just graduating college and Leif is... (inaudible) I think. And we made fun of him for a while. Well, no; not I, actually. Other people were like, \u201cOh! You\u2019re robbing the cradle, robbing, you know, she\u2019s 21, she\u2019s barely drinking, blah, blah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201391\">blah.\u201d So I was like, \u201cLeif, I fully support your decision to date this woman.\u201d I\u2019d never even met her. And after I met her, I was like, \u201cLeif, this woman is fantastic, you know. She\u2019s much older than 21, intellectually and emotionally, you know.\u201d So like, no, she\u2019s fantastic. If anything, she will <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201392\">leave him, you know, rather than him leaving her, you know. That\u2019s... That\u2019s the sad truth of it, you know, if the relationship is ended, it would be by her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Well, what about, yeah, what about being that surrogate boyfriend to Colbie? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: She needs it! (therapist responds) People, she dates men who talk down to her, because of feelings of self-worth. I can point out to her the parts of her that are special. That\u2019s... That\u2019s what I\u2019ve... That\u2019s the art of seduction, right? So I seduce her to the point, to a particular point, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D1\">know? I\u2019m not going beyond that point. (therapist affirms) I\u2019m hoping she feels comfortable and comforted and cared about, you know. These are important things to do, especially in an environment where two of the four members in the environment are going to take digs at her, because they\u2019re upset that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D2\">she broke up with them. (therapist affirms) (pause) I may have to talk to a few of those guys at some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you really like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: I do. I do. And when she started dating Charles (she dated him for a year), I was very happy. I told her this. I was like, \u201cBecause now you\u2019re part of this. Now I get to keep you.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: Yeah, she\u2019d be part of the gang.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah. Now you\u2019re part of this. So it was then like, with Francesca Milner, and James (ph), I\u2019ve told her, after not (inaudible), I was like, \u201cFrancesca...\u201d I should have said when, but I said if. I was being polite. I was like, \u201cIf you were to break up with James, I want you to know that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201451\">going to keep you,\u201d you know. And then she\u2019s like, \u201cI actually (ph) heard that a few times.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cGreat. That\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Because she will break up with James, because James is an asshole. He\u2019s one of those people who is also very smart, but unfortunately, thinks that being very smart means <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201452\">he\u2019s a genius, and he\u2019s not a genius, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">He\u2019s also incredibly emotionally insensitive and (sighs) unaware, so it\u2019s just the same thing. But... He, there is this constant drama, and Francesca Milner likes a bit of drama in her relationships, as far as I can tell. Because James is always receiving these mysterious texts, and Francesca is always <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201471\">like, \u201cWho\u2019s texting you?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo one.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cSomeone is texting you. I can see that you just got a text. Who is texting you?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, let me see your phone, if it\u2019s nobody.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo. It\u2019s my phone.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20146-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20146-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563349\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">So... (therapist affirms) she stormed off, getting angry. He\u2019s like, he\u2019s like, \u201cWhatever.\u201d When I first met her, it was a New Year\u2019s Eve party. Pete and I were out on the back porch, because he smoking a cigarette and when he does, it\u2019s often when I go and hang out and we talk. He smokes a cigarette, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201491\">so we\u2019re on the back porch in coats, because it\u2019s January. She storms out there in socks and like, in like a sweatshirt. She doesn\u2019t bother to get her coat or shoes. She\u2019s just crying. She comes out there and she\u2019s crying. We\u2019re both like, \u201cWhoa!\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019m fine, ignore me. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201492\">okay.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cOkay. No problem.\u201d Like, we will let you have your emotions in peace. (therapist affirms) You know? I respect that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">So, you know, we never thought... But she\u2019s still out there and she\u2019s still cold. When we go in, you know, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhere\u2019s Francesca?\u201d \u201cFrancesca\u2019s outside without her shoes on.\u201d So we both go outside to try to get her back in. It takes some time, but we actually do get her back in, because she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B1\">shivering like fuck, you know. For the same reason, James wouldn\u2019t let her see the texts, you know, and this often is the problem. James is so emotionally crippled that he... this is someone who made me love Ellen (sp), Leif\u2019s girlfriend, even more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">Everyone is over at Eugene\u2019s Place again, for some Sunday thing that they\u2019re having. A number of people are going down to DC to visit Pete and do some stuff down in that area. Leif and Ellen were in the kitchen with me, and we\u2019re just talking about some stuff. James runs in, he\u2019s like, \u201cLeif, I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D1\">a cover.\u201d Leif is like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cFrancesca wants to go do this thing when we\u2019re down there, I don\u2019t want to do anything. Like, so like, I need like, a way out.\u201d Leif is like, \u201cOh, you have plans with us. You have plans with us.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cRight. I have plans with you guys. Okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D2\">cool.\u201d And Ellen, you know, just has this look on her face of disgust like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d So she goes out...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Why did Leif cover, or she\u2019s not... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah, she is more mad at James for being... (therapist affirms) So Ellen, after this conversation was over, she walks out to Francesca. She\u2019s like, \u201cFrancesca, you should know that James doesn\u2019t want to go do this thing that you want to do. Instead of telling you that, he\u2019s going to ask Leif <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201511\">to cover for him and lie about having plans. So I just want you to know that.\u201d And Francesca is like, \u201cJames!\u201d Drama starts up, but I\u2019m like, \u201cThat was the correct move. That was the correct move, Ellen.\u201d The faster and more obvious we can make it to her that James is an asshole, the quicker we excise <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201512\">James from the group. We lose James, we keep Francesca... There we go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">THERAPIST: Get rid of the insensitive (inaudible) person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah. He does not contribute. That is my rule. (therapist affirms) I mean, that\u2019s my rule, right? Like, when it comes down to the vote, right? And the vote is really, I mean, Eugene and I are the vote, you know? It\u2019s like, because he\u2019s the person you know, who has the place, he invites people <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201551\">over. I\u2019m the person who will tell the truth about people, you know. He\u2019s often like, \u201cYeah, that makes good sense.\u201d He wants to be more forgiving sometimes, but if I\u2019m like, \u201cHere is the issue,\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cThat is right. That\u2019s an issue.\u201d Then we just excise that person. (therapist affirms) Eugene <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201552\">and I are the two smartest guys in the room, so we make the choices, you know. (pause) Yeah. I just found out his wife was a math major and I\u2019m jealous, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20154-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20154-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563349\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">CLIENT: Because I want a math degree. In a second. Okay, so in any case, but that is what, you know, I would like to do, is excise him. You know, he\u2019s part of the Connecticut crew, so the Connecticut crew has to kind of go along with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">THERAPIST: He was part of that crew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s part of the... there is a bunch of people... Like, Darcy brings with her a group of people that she grew up with, right? Like, Leif is among that number and Milner comes from that group. []. We\u2019ve excised a number of people from the, from the group over the years, just for their inability <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D1\">to grow up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">Some of them grew up when they let their friend drown. They didn\u2019t know until after they couldn\u2019t find them. They were all just really drunk and at a reservoir jumping off rocks, you know. Some were being, admitting irresponsible kids like, they always were in their late 20\u2019s. One of them drowned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">THERAPIST: One of them died? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20165\">THERAPIST: But they didn\u2019t know, they weren\u2019t aware of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20167\">CLIENT: They didn\u2019t know. They were all just too drunk and partying to realize that one of them had just sort of... He jumped, he jumped from a rock and didn\u2019t come back up. (therapist affirms) So that sobered a few of them, you know, I mean... but mentally not, you know. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20169\">(pause) I almost excised Xavier. I made it very clear to people. I was like, \u201cI have a real problem with Xavier.\u201d Xavier gets drunk to the point where he hurts himself and others, right? Like, at Eugene\u2019s wedding, you know, afterwards, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. Xavier has locked himself in the bathroom with <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201691\">a full bottle of champagne, which he is drinking. [] Question one: Why are you trying to save him? All right? Two: Why is he so broken?\u201d And, they explained, \u201cHe was straight-edged, totally don\u2019t do anything, you know, still straight-edged for a long time. Then his girlfriend (inaudible) cheated on <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201692\">him and it broke him. He was like, \u201cFine, I\u2019m going to do all the drugs and drink all the drinks.\u201d So for years, he\u2019s totally irresponsible, just whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B\">So they\u2019re trying to save him. I\u2019m like, \u201cDon\u2019t bother. Like, he doesn\u2019t want to be saved, right? So why are you putting in the effort to save a broken person?\u201d Well, the next morning, we got to breakfast, he looks up at me, he\u2019s like, \u201cI heard I was at my most charming last night.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B1\">And now he drinks with control. He drinks every day. He\u2019s an alcoholic and drinks every day, but he doesn\u2019t get stupid, he doesn\u2019t lose control, you know. So we kept Xavier, which is good, because Xavier is a good, kind, sweet, loving man, who can contact Anonymous. So if you ever need something hacked, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B2\">talk to Xavier.

So... (pause) Math. So... the, (sighs) That trick works, by the way. So... math. I got an 89 on the Stats test. I, right after, on Thursday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201791\">I went directly to there...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017B\">THERAPIST: You took a test that day? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I hadn\u2019t done Chapter Two yet, so I just read Chapter Two, I did the Practice Section of Chapter Two. I was like, \u201cThis seems to make sense.\u201d I went and took the test. (therapist affirms) I got an 89, which was infuriating to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">THERAPIST: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah! Because, I mean, I wanted a 90 at least. It was like, I get a fucking B+ (therapist affirms), you know? Ginny\u2019s like, \u201cB+ is good!\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s unsatisfactory!\u201d The (inaudible) to me now, with me in college, very different, you know. In college, the grade was predetermined, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201811\">I was like, I will get a C in this course, because that will keep me from graduating, you know. (corrects) A C keeps me from failing out. This will mean, to get a D in this course, so I don\u2019t have to graduate yet, you know. It was all a balancing act. You know what my GPA was? I told you about this <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201812\">trick, right? Where we had to have a, I had to make at least 2.0? My final GPA, when I left, was 2.01. Yeah. Played it perfectly, except I didn\u2019t do the Math class, which I\u2019m doing now, at a point in my life when it\u2019s actually going to be useful to me, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">THERAPIST: Well, and you\u2019re, you know, I think you\u2019re also facing a lot of that kind of anxiety that you encounter with math.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20185\">CLIENT: To a degree, but like, it\u2019s not as hard as people always said it was. When I read in Outliers that math was just practice, it changed a lot of how I viewed it. It was like, Patrick has practiced math for years, so he\u2019s good at it. And Eugene has practiced math for years and is also naturally <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201851\">talented at it. So (sighs)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20187\">THERAPIST: So the 89 was infuriating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wanted at least a 90. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018B\">THERAPIST: What did it mean to you? Tell, what...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not an A! (therapist affirms) (pause) It\u2019s not an A. I\u2019m an A student when I choose to be, so this was not an A.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like you describe it as being unacceptable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20191\">CLIENT: Yes! This is a slap in my face, by myself, you know? (therapist affirms) So I\u2019m like, when I go in, I\u2019m going to sit down with the professor and look over the test and see like, where they\u2019re giving partial credit for stuff, because I think this graph that I drew like, it might have been confusing <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201911\">to the people grading it. They might have marked me down for it. (pause) And so... if that\u2019s the issue, I\u2019ll be like, I need one more point, you know. Like, that\u2019s all I care about (therapist affirms), just one more point, and then 90.

If I decide to get an A in a course, there is no reason why I should not get an A in the course, right? I mean, that\u2019s all there is to it, right? I am better than that, you know? Ginny is like, \u201cB+ is great!\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cA B+ is not great. B+ is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201951\">great.\u201d (therapist affirms) A B+ is a normal person getting a grade. I don\u2019t want to be a fucking normal person. That disgusts me. It\u2019s a world of goldfish, to quote Mycroft. Now mind you, that\u2019s hyperbole of the highest degree. But, you know, in Sherlock\u2019s world (and that show is great), a discussion <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201952\">with Mycroft, his older brother, and Sherlock, and they talk about growing up together. Sherlock is like, \u201cI thought I was an idiot.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20197\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, because his brother is so much smarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s like, \u201cSo did I!\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWe had no idea until we met regular children.\u201d He was like, \u201cCan you imagine, Sherlock?

I want to walk out of this saying, \u201cNo, I know how to do statistics,\u201d you know. I don\u2019t really fucking need to make a histogram or fucking pareto (ph) chart or like a pareto (ph) chart, I think or thing or like a stem leaf table. I don\u2019t need to make these things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201A91\">there is no reason to do these. This is the basics, this is just, you know, x + 5y = 10. Okay, let\u2019s try to figure out what these variables mean, you know. Like, I need a second equation to solve that first one, but still, it\u2019s fine, whatever, you know. (sighs) Yeah. You always need one more equation <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201A92\">than exists for some of the variables. If you have three variables, you need four equations.

My thinking is that I misnamed the types of data. For some reason, that is the trickiest part for me. There are only a few levels of measurement with data. For instance, there are, there is nominal (therapist repeats), there is ordinal (therapist repeats), <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B11\">integral, and ratio. (therapist affirms) Right, exactly. I have a harder time with integral and ratio, determining which of these two it is. (therapist affirms) I keep telling myself ratio, if double matters. If twice this matters, then that\u2019s ratio, right? Otherwise, it\u2019s integral, right? If the number <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B12\">matters, if it\u2019s just the distance between the numbers matters, but double doesn\u2019t matter, then it\u2019s integral. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B3\">For instance, when someone says, \u201cWell, this car is a 2002 car and this car is a 2004 car,\u201d that\u2019s integral data, right? Because you\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, this car is twice as old as this car, it\u2019s not really what we\u2019re looking for. Right? We\u2019re looking for how much older is this car than that car?\u201d By <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B31\">years. Um... Or maybe not. Maybe I got that one wrong. Maybe that was ratio data, you know? (therapist affirms) But I\u2019ll find out and I\u2019ll have to study those terms some more, until I get them down. But nominal is the easiest one, you know? It\u2019s just this fucking quan , not quan , it\u2019s qualitative <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B32\">(therapist affirms) just the name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, an ordinal is just the order.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Where the space between the numbers has no relevance whatsoever, because even in context, there is less, you know... Unless one knows every single bit of information, in which case then it\u2019s integral, still might not even matter. But, again, the difference in the second-best student <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B71\">and the third-best student might be significantly greater than the difference between the third-best student and the fourth-best student, right? So therefore, it\u2019s ordinal. Yeah. Integral is only when the distance matters, ratio is when double matters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201B9\">(pause) That\u2019s actually a pretty good example. For a while, I was struggling with it in the book, until I went on and read the next section, ratio data. I didn\u2019t get it, but like, for instance, integral data; it doesn\u2019t make sense. Instead of 20 degrees Celsius is twice as hot as 10 degrees Celsius. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B91\">I mean like, that\u2019s stupid. 20 degrees Celsius is twice as hot as 10 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s the scale we\u2019ve determined. Twenty is twice 10, therefore it, this makes no sense. Link it to ratio, you\u2019re like, Ah! In ratio, you care about whether or not, right? Where you should have said, \u201cIn integral <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B92\">data, this doesn\u2019t make sense to say 20 is double 10.\u201d You should have said, \u201cIn integral we don\u2019t care that 20 is double 10. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for. That would have been a better way to write that book.\u201d (therapist affirms) Quality assurance, boom! That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for! (sighs) To fix <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201B93\">mistakes of very smart people. (therapist affirms) (pause) Am I arrogant this way, Carl? Am I arrogant, you know? I\u2019m fine with that, if I am, you know.

I think of it as like a... something to do with a real powerful feeling of, feelings around... well, I mean, I think of one, of expecting a lot of yourself in a way that\u2019s very good, that you want to strive for the best of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N201BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563349\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yes!

(therapist affirms) I don\u2019t. As Charles pointed out about me, everything is either broken or could be improved. (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N201C51\">affirms) Which is also true.

Okay, maybe flip it off until later, right? Everything can be improved. But if something is broken, that must be addressed. And it must be addressed with prejudice, if need be.

(therapist affirms) Heroin just, it just kills you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201EB\">THERAPIST: He was, apparently, did you hear, he was clean for 23 years or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201ED\">CLIENT: Yeah, man. I mean, I didn\u2019t know it was that long, but I know he really struggled for a long...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201EF\">THERAPIST: And then he went back a couple of years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201F1\">CLIENT: Well, then there you go. I mean, it\u2019s heroin. Quitting something is something you do every day of the rest of your life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that was terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, these fucking e-cigarettes? (pause) Pretty sure those are just going to give you mouth cancer, which is worse than lung cancer, because you live with your mouth cancer, (inaudible) mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know they\u2019re outlawing it. They\u2019re trying to outlaw it in a couple of states.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201F9\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201FB\">CLIENT: Wow, that\u2019s great. I mean, in a state that\u2019s like, \u201cWe use fine (ph), e-cigarettes are bad.\u201d (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201FD\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) How about that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m down today. If they outlawed tobacco, I would be just as fine. I\u2019m like, \u201cIt just kills you. It does nothing else but kill you.\u201d Nicotine itself, you have to wear gloves when you work in tobacco; otherwise, you will get skin cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20201\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20203\">CLIENT: Yeah, and working with the leaves that often, nicotine will eventually seep into your skin; it\u2019s cancerous!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20205\">THERAPIST: Oh, if you do, if you actually do the picking of the tobacco leaves?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20207\">CLIENT: Yeah, they have to wear gloves or else they\u2019ll get skin cancer. Nicotine is just poison. It\u2019s just poison. People ask, \u201cWhat is the purpose of a plant that\u2019s just poison?\u201d It\u2019s like, someone said, \u201cWell, tobacco usually grows in places naturally where the earth needs to recover, where it needs <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202071\">to be left alone.\u201d (therapist responds) Similar to poison ivy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20209\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it\u2019s an evolutionary kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2020B\">CLIENT: Yeah. The earth is a living organism, right? I mean, dirt is alive. There is so much life in dirt. I finally decided I\u2019m going to be vegetarian, because plants grow better when they feed on blood and bone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2020F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what the earth wants. It wants blood and bone. That\u2019s why we should all be buried, instead of cremated, if you\u2019re going to be responsible about it, you know. I mean, put your chemicals back in the earth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20211\">THERAPIST: Ashes to ashes... or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20213\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20215\">THERAPIST: Well, listen. My advice, again. Those are strikes, what happened at the other jobs. (client affirms) That don\u2019t need, you don\u2019t have to apologize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20217\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. Okay. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. I will not apologize for those. (therapist affirms) I made good choices for good reasons, some thought and effort. (pause) They failed me, I did not fail them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N20216-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20216-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563349\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20219\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you got...

Seems pretty logical to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2021D\">THERAPIST: Well, all right.
