AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s cooking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Just like there\u2019s always something right up to the hour. And then you get five minutes in between to do your notes. But if you want to go to the bathroom or you want to get a drink of water or\u2026 then the next one, and you\u2019re like, \u201cShit, they showed up.\u201d But it\u2019s funny how like it\u2019s fast paced, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">and even though I have that reaction of like, \u201cShit, they showed up,\u201d once I\u2019m sitting with them it\u2019s fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Ah. Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was running late today because Bill, the boss, came into my office like five minutes before I was gonna leave to consult about someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Catch your breath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Then the traffic. Then I wasted three quarters because I forgot it was President\u2019s Day. Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right, no hidden, no fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Just three quarters. And that reminded me of money, which reminded me of my dad, who called me and gave me his Social Security number. I think I\u2019ve mentioned this to you, he wanted me to put him down as a dependent on my tax forms, and that\u2019s illegal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Well, your dad\u2026 I know Billy had wanted you to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, this is my biological dad who is in Chile and who wanted to help me financially however he could, so he was like, \u201cTake down my Social Security number, you\u2019re gonna put me down as a dependent on your taxes so you get more money back.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So I just humored him and I wrote it down. And I did my taxes on my own, I used like an online service\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: \u2026 and I was really proud of myself. Like this is the first time I do it on my own and everything. Getting slightly more than last year, but we\u2019re moving up, so that\u2019s that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re moving up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: But then like just\u2026 even though I wasn\u2019t planning to do that, like I said, \u201cOh, what would happen if I clicked, you know, dependent?\u201d And they asked me all these questions about like\u2026 you know, because they have criteria, like the person has to have lived with you for a certain amount of time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">or the person, you have to give them 50% of your income. And I\u2019m thinking to myself, if I get audited I have no way of proving\u2026 you know, I\u2019m gonna end up in prison or something. I\u2019m like, no, we\u2019re not gonna do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d have to pay it back. [0:02:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: But then I thought about how he\u2019s gonna call me and yell at me. And he kind of did, last night he called, and he was like all confused. And I couldn\u2019t explain it in Spanish, but I was trying to explain like, \u201cThat\u2019s illegal, if I get audited that\u2019s a big problem, I can\u2019t just do that.\u201d And he <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">couldn\u2019t understand like why I couldn\u2019t just do that. He thought like I was choosing for him not to help me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I see. He might not have really understood that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: \u2026 it was a legal matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. And just my dad\u2019s so funny, he calls and\u2026 He had called me a few days prior just to do his quick, \u201cHello. How are you? Everything good? Okay, bye.\u201d And then he had asked, \u201cCan I call you on Sunday night, will you have some time on Sunday night to talk?\u201d I was like, \u201cSure.\u201d So I thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">he had to tell me bad news or something. But it was the same old kind of just blah silence, him telling me he doesn\u2019t have a job yet, but he might sell some property, and if that goes well I might send you a couple hundred bucks. And I might move back to Jamaica for about a month to get some work there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">Some lady needs some help with her house. Like he doesn\u2019t really give me details, he\u2019s just really vague.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">And then he mentions, \u201cI saw your sister\u2019s Facebook. I don\u2019t like these guys she\u2019s hanging out with on the beach, these like muscular guys, she\u2019s standing next them in pictures. Or this guy in a suit.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, dad, they\u2019re not her boyfriends, but I mean, she has friends, she goes out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: But this is\u2026 appears on like a Facebook or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s my little sister has a Facebook. This is the one I share with my dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And your dad\u2019s on as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: He has a Face\u2026 I don\u2019t know if he even knows how to use it. He doesn\u2019t even have a profile picture, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s funny. And she\u2019s blocked him. But somehow he\u2019s like seeing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Somehow he sees the pictures. [0:04:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she posts pictures\u2026 she has a new guy every different week and a half, and they\u2019re never relationships. But, you know, she\u2019s like meeting guys and she takes pictures. And he\u2019s all like suspicious, and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou need to knock some sense into her and really like tell her to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">something with her life.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, but, you know, she\u2019s in Jamaica, she\u2019s far away. Like she\u2019s just having fun, and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s getting married or she\u2019s pregnant. Like those guys aren\u2019t her boyfriends.\u201d \u201cYeah, but aren\u2019t you the psychologist? Shouldn\u2019t you knock some sense into her?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah dad, I try. I try to give her good advice when she\u2019s on the phone with me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">And then I kinda switched gears, and I said, \u201cWell, you know, me on the other hand though, I am dating someone. Do you want to hear about that? He\u2019s a psychologist too, and he\u2019s 35, and we have a lot in common.\u201d Silence. Just complete silence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And the only thing he said was\u2026 he said it in Spanish, but he said like, \u201cWithin crazy people they understand one another.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Hm. What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: In Spanish that\u2019s a direct translation, but I\u2019m thinking, like you have a lot of things to talk about because you both study crazy people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: But it sounded like we\u2019re crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m\u2026 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: That was a direct translation. That\u2019s all he said, and then he switched topics. It\u2019s just so interesting how like my role, or my sexuality, my gender, like it\u2019s never in his realm, you know. Like he doesn\u2019t ask me about it. I mean, I\u2019m older now, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m a 20-year-old girl, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">And he\u2019s just no curiosity, he doesn\u2019t want to know details, what\u2019s his name, nothing. Are you happy? You know, I would appreciate a dad that would tell me something like, you know, \u201cI hope you find a good man one day that treats you well, treats you with respect and takes care of you.\u201d I\u2019ve never heard <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">him say anything like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm, mm. Yeah. [0:06:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: And so I\u2019m just thinking like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, takes kind of a\u2026 well, hands off approach is one way to put it. But it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s frozen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then\u2026 in this moment I just got reminded of Brian. You know, that silence.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: That silence, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I\u2019m just thinking like, what a\u2026 what a messed up kind of\u2026 I guess nobody has a normal upbringing. Some people are lucky enough that like both parents are stable, somewhat happily married, that they both talk about healthy relationships and say, you know, \u201cWe hope that you end up with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">someone like this.\u201d And they show it by example, you know, like as a couple they get along. I just had such messed up examples, like a father who just denied that I even had that part to me. Don\u2019t talk about guys, don\u2019t talk about yourself as a woman. And then my mom and Billy were just weirdoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Like no wonder it\u2019s confusing for me. So I\u2019m still with James, and it\u2019s both exciting and scary, because it keeps on getting better and better. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What\u2026 yeah, what\u2019s been happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: So I had a very weird experience. This was on Wednesday night, so this was after I saw you last. On Wednesday\u2026 Friday was my payday, by the way, don\u2019t let me forget this before I leave. Friday was my payday. And so Wednesday there was a storm coming, I was very tight on money, I had like 20 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">bucks, remember? So I said to myself, \u201cOkay, James is coming over tonight, I just need some like eggs and milk and gas for my car.\u201d But I had 20 bucks. So I was like thinking to myself, it\u2019d be really useful if for example Billy put 20 bucks in my account. So I call him up, and I explain there\u2019s a storm <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">coming, I only have 20 bucks, can you just help me out and give me 20 bucks more? And he just makes it so complicated. He was like, \u201cWell, what do you need to get? You need to go to the supermarket? Well, why don\u2019t you do this, when you\u2019re at the supermarket get the manager on the phone and have him <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F3\">talk to me and I\u2019ll give him my credit card number.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cBilly, you\u2019re in Alabama. Supermarkets don\u2019t do that, they\u2019re not going to do that for me.\u201d And he\u2019s just\u2026 like there\u2019s a sense of entitlement, like special treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Hm. [0:09:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: And I felt like saying, \u201cYou know what, forget it. I\u2019ll go without gas, or without eggs. Like just forget it.\u201d But I said, \u201cYeah, Billy, okay. I\u2019ll call you from the supermarket, thank you. And I didn\u2019t plan to call him from the supermarket. And he texted me later, \u201cI put 20 bucks in your account.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">But I just got in such a bad mood. There was something\u2026 Like I was rushing, because I had my group on Wednesday nights, and I was supposed to meet James, because he was going to spend the night, and there was a storm coming. And I was rushing, and I think in the back of mind I\u2019m always thinking, \u201cOh <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">my God, he\u2019s going to be mad at me because I\u2019m late.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: But also that thing about Billy just stirred up crap, and then it reminded me about how poor I was. And James texted me, \u201cI\u2019m waiting at the bar across the street from your house, I\u2019m sitting here having a drink watching sports, take your time.\u201d And again I\u2019m thinking to myself like, \u201cShit! <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">He\u2019s probably going to expect me to go and join him and have a beer. Or maybe he\u2019ll even want to eat there.\u201d And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: So all this stuff got stirred up and I was just in the worst mood by the time I got to my house and parked. And I walk into the bar\u2026 and this didn\u2019t surprise me at all, because he\u2019s such a friendly guy, but he\u2019s sitting at the bar, and there\u2019s a seat in between that he\u2019s saving for me, and there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">a woman, and they\u2019re talking. And something about that also just added to my fury. It\u2019s not like it was a huge jealousy thing, because he\u2019s just that kind\u2026 he\u2019ll talk to anybody. But something about that I think added to it. And I came in, I put my coat down, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, just give me a minute, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">have to run to the restroom.\u201d And went in the restroom, collected myself. Because I was like when I came in here, like panting. And finally I sat down next to him, and he said, you know, \u201cVery nice to meet you,\u201d and totally paid attention to me. But I could tell by my body language I was acting a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B3\">aggressive, because as soon as I sit down I\u2019m like this, with my back completely to the woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: [unclear]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he had ordered me drink already, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou sound stressed, is everything okay?\u201d And I just felt like not like myself. I felt like I was going to break down and start sobbing. Like just one of those moments. Like I knew that if I was home alone I probably would have been in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">bad mood, everything\u2019s fine. But the fact that I had this caring tender person there, like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: You know when like someone asks you like, \u201cAre you okay,\u201d and then \u201cNnnnn!\u201d, that\u2019s when it comes out, you start crying. That\u2019s how I felt. And I was basically a mess. Like I was just not acting myself, I was a little on edge. And I felt something brewing in me like that used to brew when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">was with Kevin, that something else had pissed me off but I felt like taking it out on him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: So there was something in me that I so wanted to like get off with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: But I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: What\u2026 yeah, tell me, what did you\u2026 [0:12:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, like\u2026 I could have made a big deal out of like\u2026 even something simple like him talking to a woman or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: But it didn\u2019t even bother me. And like I\u2019m able to now step away and say like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about him, you\u2019re upset right now. He\u2019s just trying to be nice, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going through your mind. Just breathe.\u201d Before with Kevin and stuff I wasn\u2019t able to do that, I would just lash out <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">and start\u2026 just act like a bitch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Huh! Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: So even though I was acting a little bit off\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: It would\u2026 I was thinking that. In some way though that is like some mainline\u2026 mainline expressway to telling them\u2026 bringing them into how you\u2019re really feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or how I really am. Like what I\u2019m capable of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What you\u2019re capable of. Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s funny, because that was the theme of the night. Because I\u2019ll tell you the rest of the story. But I think that was the theme of the night. Like\u2026 and we had also discussed this in therapy, and it was coming up for me in my mind, that he\u2019s going to ultimately discover all the messy parts <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">of me and not like it. So here we are\u2026 I wanted to see him, it was the middle of the week. Like, you know, here\u2019s my dream come true, a guy that wants to see me more than once every two weeks. But during the week I\u2019m busy, and it\u2019s fast paced, and my hair\u2019s a mess. And, you know, when I\u2019m getting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F2\">know someone, presenting, like my hair is straight, my makeup is fresh. And, you know, he\u2019s just seeing me like all frazzled. And on top of that I\u2019m in a bad mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. [unclear]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: So like starting to see like the real me. And I chugged my drink. Which was a mistake, because then I got teary eyed. And he was so good. Like he just\u2026 he knew right away something was going on, and he kind of like took me and put me on his shoulder and whispered to me, like, \u201cI just want you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">to know, like whatever is going on I want to hear about it whenever you want to talk about it. And I\u2019m gonna have moments that I\u2019m gonna be crying because I just got off the phone with my mom or something and I\u2019m gonna need you to do the same thing for me. Whatever\u2019s going on right now it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">here with you.\u201d Like grounding me and\u2026 And that made me want to cry even more. [0:14:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And he was inviting you to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, he was totally fine with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Then we sat down at the table. Thank God it was 40\u00a2 chicken wing night, so I had like a really cheap dinner. And after that one drink I was just like a little more calm. And we got to talking, and we didn\u2019t really talk about anything that was bothering me and we had a normal night. But then <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">things got weird again once we went back to my place. And I don\u2019t know what was going on, but during sex I started crying. Now, all this was going on, but also I think the fact that Valentine\u2019s Day was coming up, Brian was in the back of my mind. And just\u2026 like I had been thinking the night before about, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">\u201cWow, this is really sad, this is my second Valentine\u2019s Day with Brian and again not seeing him. I know he\u2019s going to be working because I\u2019ve already asked. This great new guy is taking me out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what did\u2026 remind me again, when did you and Brian begin seeing each other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: October last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Twelve, 2012.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I started crying, and right away he stopped and he asked me what was going on. And I said\u2026 I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this.\u201d And he was like, \u201cDo what?\u201d And I was like, \u201cLike just blend all the like crazy fun sex with this nurturing person, like this caring relationship. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">know how to do that, and I\u2019m trying to figure out how to do that.\u201d And he just held me, and like I don\u2019t even remember what he said to me, but whatever he said to me it helped me feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Hm. [0:16:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Like he said something like, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, we can figure it out together.\u201d Like, \u201cYou can talk to me about that, you can tell me what you need from me.\u201d I\u2019m having a really hard time orgasming at all with him, and I think it\u2019s emotional. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m having a hard time blending the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Because he is such a\u2026 he\u2019s not vanilla though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: He\u2019s not. Like he\u2019s got an edge to him, and he\u2019s got a funny sense of humor, dirty sense of humor. He can go to those places with me. So that happened, that was over, I felt better. I ended up telling him what was bothering me that night. So he knows, like it\u2019s out in the open. Something else <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">happened that was really big, that was very just a lot of feeling. So in the middle of this we\u2019re just like embracing each other, and I\u2019m crying. And he said something like, \u201cAre you afraid that you\u2019re falling in love with me? And are you afraid that I\u2019m falling in love with you?\u201d And I just started <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF2\">crying so much more. Because I really feeling like I am, like I\u2019m in the process of falling for this guy. Like it was just incredible that he got it, you know, and it was just a really powerful moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And speaking\u2026 and really speaking to like something happening between you two that\u2019s opening up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he doesn\u2019t quite know everything that\u2019s going on in my head, but like he\u2019s so open to learning about it and hearing about it. And then on Friday he had planned reservations. And I knew that Brian had been working because he was texting me sometimes at night. And Friday Brian texted <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">me in the morning, like 7:00 a.m., he was driving home from work and he said like, \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day, I love you, I hope you have a good day.\u201d And I thought that was really sweet. \u201cThank you, I hope you have a good day too.\u201d And then he didn\u2019t text me again until I got home, and I was rushing when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">I got home to take a shower and go to Bunker Hill, because the restaurant was by Bunker Hill. And so Brian texted me, \u201cHi, how was your day?\u201d I said, \u201cBusy, how was your day?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping all day, and I\u2019m about to sleep again, round two, because I have work to do.\u201d And I\u2019m just reaffirming <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C33\">to myself, like this is why this doesn\u2019t work. Like here he is sleeping all day because he needs to because he needs to work hard later. Like how selfish of me would it be to like, \u201cWell no, you need to come see me, and you need to take me out for Valentine\u2019s.\u201d You know, like\u2026 [0:19:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">So whatever. After that I said to him, \u201cI have to jump in the shower now.\u201d And he wrote, \u201cUh huh.\u201d But I know all these little like micro communication things, and so I knew that meant like attitude, like, \u201cOh, Uh huh.\u201d And so I wrote back, \u201c?\u201d [says \u201cquestion mark\u201d] And he didn\u2019t write me anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">back. So I was busy, I got ready, got dressed up, drove. I had a wonderful night. Brian didn\u2019t text the rest of the night. I wouldn\u2019t have answered anyways because I\u2019m really trying to\u2014at least when I\u2019m with James\u2014to separate. Because I can feel that my feelings of Brian are getting in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Like in bed that night they were totally\u2026 I was thinking of Brian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That Wednesday night. Or Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Wednesday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Wednesday, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: I was\u2026 like I was missing him in a way. I was missing the sex we used to have. Because, I mean, it\u2019s not like the sex with James is bad, it\u2019s just different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: And so I got to his house, he had like flowers waiting, and I made him a card and I wrote something in there. And I got a bottle of something, and the chocolates he likes. It was so sweet, because my mom had teased me about like, \u201cPlease make sure you get a picture.\u201d And I was like, okay, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">think we\u2019re at the point that I don\u2019t feel silly like asking, \u201cHey, can we take a picture.\u201d And so we\u2019re about to leave to the restaurant and I go to grab my camera, and that\u2019s when I hear him say, \u201cHey, before we go can we take a picture?\u201d So I was like, oh my God, this is so great. Like it\u2019s everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D52\">I\u2019ve ever wanted. And so we posed for pictures. And I don\u2019t realize it, but he\u2019s sending the pictures to his dad and I\u2019m sending the pictures to my mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: [laughs] [0:20:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: And then we\u2019re sitting at the restaurant and he gets a text and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, \u2018pretty psychologist,\u2019 it says.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s my dad.\u201d And then we both started cracking up, because I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my God, I sent my pictures to my mom too.\u201d And it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">a very nice restaurant, with like a fireplace, and like American food but like fancy. You know, so they had like buffalo chicken mac and cheese, but like the best tasting ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: And we got like\u2026 I got a fancy chocolate martini that I\u2019ve never had before, like we really indulged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: And I was great con\u2026 it\u2019s just easy between us. It\u2019s fun conversation, it\u2019s easy. He was saying things\u2026 So we sat by a fireplace, and he said something like, \u201cOh, I want to have a fireplace at my house one day. And I want to lie in front of the fireplace on a rug.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, on a bearskin <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">rug like naked?\u201d And he starts laughing, he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no, no, just like a big rug with the dogs.\u201d Because we both talked about how he wants like a yellow lab and I want a basset hound and\u2026 So like there\u2019s these like playing around, like fantasy, you know, about what a family would look like. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">I totally picture him doing that.

I didn\u2019t have a single orgasm, which very much disappointed me, but I keep on saying like, \u201cThis is emotional, this is because I\u2019m not letting myself completely go with it yet.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Mm, mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Since I had had a few drinks I decided to test the boundaries a little bit, and I started trying to incorporate things that I would normally ask for or do with Brian, or with someone like Brian, with him.

So that night I dreamt that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">I was in a room, and I was either like a man or a woman, but I must have been a man because in the room was my wife, my small daughter, and like my adolescent son. And we were saying goodbye, we were placed in that room because I had a few hours until I had to die. Have you ever seen that movie \u201cHellraiser\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that the one with the pinhead?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I know a little bit about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200FC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: So they\u2019re like demons, and they come and they torture people and send them to hell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: So I had like five hours until I get sent to this room with these demons that are basically going to torture me and then kill me.

Like it\u2019s got a bed, it\u2019s got a TV up there with like the cable going. Almost like a waiting room, like a generic looking family room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: And in there\u2026 on the bed is like my wife, and a daughter that\u2019s like four, and a son that\u2019s like 12 or 13.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Your wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that was the weird part. But I didn\u2019t feel like a man. Like I don\u2019t know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: \u2026 I couldn\u2019t see myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Um\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: And we were just hugging, and holding each other, and telling each other how much we loved each other, and laughing, because we knew that this would be our last moments together. And then after that, like I looked at the countdown, there was a clock up there and it was time for me to go, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">I left. And I felt ready to die I remember. And I got put in this dark like padded room, and I got tied up like this. And all of a sudden I look to my left and my son is there, he snuck into the room somehow. And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI really just wanted to be with you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B2\">It\u2019s okay, I just wanted to be with you in here.\u201d And I was freaking out because I was like, \u201cOh my God, he\u2019s going to see all this torture.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAs soon as it happens just start closing your eyes.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And then it started, and these things came out of the walls that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B3\">were like ripping pieces of my cheeks off. Like very violently, like some scary movie. And then I just remember after that I could feel like my body shutting down. And then I just died. And then the dream ended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: You had died in the dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: I died in the dream, yeah. So the next morning I told my dream to James and he interpreted it for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: What did he say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just interesting how you\u2026 you know, we were talking about a lot of family stuff yesterday, and then yesterday after the sex I told you that I actually like some of the stuff. And I know you\u2019ve been grappling with trying to combine this whole like family nurturance part of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">you with the sexual part that you see as like violent in a way.\u201d Because like I told him some things like that I like the whole dominance thing, and I think at first he initially thought\u2026 Now it\u2019s coming back to me. Wednesday night, when I had the crying incident, I said something to him like\u2026 like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201232\">that I like it rough, or that I like to be\u2026 to be dominated, or something like that. And he was saying to me, \u201cI can\u2019t do that to you.\u201d Because I think he thought that I was asking him to hit me or something, or insult me. I think I was asking him to insult me. And I felt a lot of shame in that moment <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201233\">because I was like admitting to him that things like that turn me on. So he said, \u201cAnd you know how you were telling me that the other day.\u201d It\u2019s like the Sunday in the room\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: \u2026 like the innocence in the room\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: \u2026 exposing you, that you being tied up\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2012A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: \u2026 hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Like trying to negotiate, like how do these two things fit together in the same room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: So that was neat. And we had a good next day. And I purposely went home early Saturday to kind of exert my independence, like I was like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t want to spend too much time with anyone, I still want my freedom.\u201d And I was planning to go out with my friends Saturday night, which I did, even <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201371\">though there was a little snowstorm. But I realized that night after going out that I would have rather him be with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: Hm. [0:28:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: And he also acknowledged that, like he said, \u201cI\u2019m very social, I like going out to people\u2019s houses, going out to bars, meeting your friends, you meeting my friends. But I just would prefer to like go to those places, have fun, mingle, even on our own, but then go home together.\u201d And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B1\">\u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: So we kind of decided like we would try that this weekend coming up, you know. So we\u2019re just so on the same page. And then to throw a wrench in everything, after the Valentine\u2019s Day text with Brian that I said I need to shower now, and he said, uh huh, and he never responded, the next morning <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">I looked at my phone and I notice at like 1:54 in the morning he had written me, \u201cGonna be away for a while, not gonna be able to talk.\u201d And that\u2019s it. So after I left James\u2019 house\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: And this is all\u2026 this is like the 1:54 a.m.\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: Valentine\u2019s night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: \u2026 of Valentine\u2019s night, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: And so I wrote him back, \u201cCan you be a little more specific, as in you\u2019re going to be gone today, for a week, for a month? Like what\u2019s going on? Okay, I won\u2019t bother you, hope everything\u2019s okay.\u201d And then like the next day or something I texted again, \u201cI really hope everything\u2019s okay. Just confused.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201471\">And I said something again like, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you keep just cutting me off like this when I\u2019ve told you repeatedly how much it hurts me.\u201d Then he finally\u2026 last night I\u2019m sleeping, 3:54 in the morning\u2014because I had left my ringer on\u2014I get a text from Brian. \u2014 3:54 in the morning! Like, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201472\">the fuck? And he writes\u2026 he writes that, \u201cI told you that I had to go away for a while, you told me that when I\u2019m feeling this way I need to tell you.\u201d And then it registers, like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you remember, but I had told him before, next time you feel like you\u2019re overly <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201473\">emotional and you need a break from me, tell me like, \u201cLook, I can\u2019t talk, but I promise we\u2019ll talk about this soon.

[0:30:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: But he was just so vague about it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it was differently worded, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: \u2026 that I was just like, \u201cWhat?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: Yeah. He might not have known what you meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: So I finally got like a good phone. Billy got it for me for 80 bucks. It\u2019s like a six hundred-something dollar phone. Don\u2019t ask how he did it. But you know Billy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: No. He just called until he got a manager on the phone that agreed to a new device.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: What is it, is it a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a new Samsung Galaxy 4.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Oh, [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: Very good, I don\u2019t know how to use it.

So that\u2019s why he\u2019s texting me in the middle of the night.\u201d [pause] Okay. Well, \u201cWhy are you doing this now at 3 in the morning?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: But what did he write at\u2026 what did he write?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Well, he\u2026 it doesn\u2019t show, it doesn\u2019t like go more up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: But I think before that was pretty much what I just said, like, \u201cYou told me when I need some time to myself to tell you I\u2019m going away, so I\u2019m going away.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Oh, he said that, that was the opening\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">CLIENT: At 3:54 in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">CLIENT: And so I wrote back something like, \u201cOh, now I get it, you were kind of unclear. Okay, I\u2019m sorry. Now I understand.\u201d I wish it would go up [the phone display]. But he said something like\u2026 Or I asked him something, \u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s going to be? Can you at least tell me that?\u201d And he <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201731\">said, \u201cIt might be forever. Because I\u2019ve realized that we don\u2019t have the same investment in this relationship.\u201d And I wrote back something like\u2026 and this is 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. So I\u2019m like, \u201cBrian, first of all, I\u2019m not a business transaction, so try to add some feeling words. And second of all, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201732\">it\u2019s 3 a.m., like why are you doing this right now?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">THERAPIST: Okay. [0:32:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">CLIENT: And then he wrote back, \u201cI feel that you\u2019re not investing in this relationship like I am.\u201d And he said, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not 3 a.m. here where I am, so\u2026 And I\u2019m not going to be back for a while.\u201d And I asked, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d and he won\u2019t answer. And then he just starts kind of like blabbing about <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201771\">things that don\u2019t make any sense, like it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s all unspoken. Like he said, \u201cWe talked. You kept going. We talked again, and you went out and fucked on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d I said, this isn\u2019t about fucking, I went out to dinner.\u201d And said, \u201cAnd didn\u2019t answer me till noon the next day.\u201d I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201772\">\u201cYou didn\u2019t write me back after I said I had to shower.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t shower at 6 p.m., you had a date and you knew it.\u201d Then we got into this whole, like I said to him, \u201cDo you just want me to sit at home and wait for you to be done with school then, is that gonna prove that I love you?\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201773\">he said, \u201cToo late for that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">CLIENT: I said, \u201cAll I\u2019ve wanted is to share a life with you, which requires you to actually see me and actually do things with me out in the world. Are you asking me to wait for that?\u201d He says, \u201cI did ask, I told you multiple times. You cheated on me twice last year, and again this year.\u201d And I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B1\">\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m getting very little now, and you promised to give me it all in another few semesters.\u201d Because I\u2019m gathering, even though he hasn\u2019t ever spoken these words, I\u2019m gathering this is his plan. Because just from little things he said that I\u2019ve gathered, and then I\u2019ve repeated it back to him <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B2\">and he hasn\u2019t said no. So I\u2019m guessing, okay, your plan is to leave your wife and to be with me and have a family with me once you finish with school. Which wouldn\u2019t be until like next spring. But keep in mind, he\u2019s never explicitly used these words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: No, right, right. Yeah. [0:34:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">CLIENT: And then he writes back, \u201cYou\u2019re unwilling or unable to wait.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking a lot from me and not giving much in return. Meaning I don\u2019t see you, you don\u2019t go out with me.\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m not asking anything. I know what I need to know. Your mind is made up, you\u2019re not waiting, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F1\">pursuing another relationship.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this over text at 3 in the morning.\u201d He said, \u201cI felt so guilty\u2014\u201d SO, written in big letters\u2014\u201dI wasn\u2019t there for you on Valentine\u2019s. You were so lovey dovey in the morning, and you had a date and you knew it.\u201d I said, \u201cI needed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F2\">hear that on Valentine\u2019s Day but you keep it all inside.

Like it doesn\u2019t register in his brain when I tell him\u2014and I\u2019ve been telling him this since we started together\u2014like, okay, he\u2019s married, I get that. He can\u2019t do those <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201811\">things for me now, I get that. All I would need is for him to say, \u201cI so want to be with you today, and I feel so bad that I can\u2019t. And I promise\u2026 let\u2019s make it up, let\u2019s do something. Let\u2019s be together on Tuesday,\u201d or whatever. But I need to hear that, and I need him to follow through with the behavior. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201812\">And he\u2019s not understanding that like because he\u2019s not giving that I can\u2019t just wait around.

So there\u2019s kind of like why am I just hearing of this now, this doesn\u2019t make any sense, that kind of\u2026 Yeah. Yeah. Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">CLIENT: And what\u2019s even more confusing about him is today at work\u2026 So basically I had to cut communication last night, and I said\u2026 Oh, I\u2019m just reading this from last night. Oh, \u201cYou accepted my marriage.\u201d I thought he was asking me to marry him. \u201cYou promised to be faithful.\u201d And I said, \u201cBrian, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201911\">need to sleep right now. Please don\u2019t see this as me not caring, but I just need to go right now. Please, let\u2019s talk more later.\u201d So then what\u2019s really confusing is that this morning\u2014or this afternoon\u2014I get just random dirty text of him trying to initiate like phone sex or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20195\">CLIENT: And him telling me how he\u2019s going to hurt me so badly next time he sees me, and if I\u2019m free tomorrow night.

I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for you a long time, and then this wonderful person comes into my life that offers me all the things I\u2019ve been waiting for. And you\u2019re not even using your words or your behaviors to show me like <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD1\">that I should keep waiting for you.

What if he chickens out and he never leaves his wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think this is, I mean, in some way coming on because of you and James. I mean, you know, that he\u2019s really reacting to knowing there\u2019s another man in the picture, and you have feelings, you\u2019re going out to Valentine\u2019s Day, you\u2019re with him that night, late night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B7\">THERAPIST: And he knows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B9\">CLIENT: My friend Carly, who I always tell you I admire, like just her clinical skills.

Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C1\">CLIENT: And I noticed a little change in her, like she\u2019s more protective of me and basically saying like, \u201cOh, I wish you could just tell Brian like, \u2018Look, if it\u2019s meant to be, it\u2019s meant to be. Give me a call when you\u2019re single.\u2019\u201d And she never used to say comments like that. Like she\u2019s fed up. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C11\">she still tries to be as supportive as possible. And she kind of understood this whole thing that I just explained to you as\u2026 she said, \u201cBrian senses that something is different. Like you\u2019ve never put someone else before him. Like, \u2018I gotta go shower now.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:40:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C5\">CLIENT: You cut off communication and get ready for a date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I see.

It\u2019s to take back power. Like even\u2026 Or trying to take back power.\u201d So I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\u2026 Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD\">CLIENT: But why\u2026 I keep\u2026 It\u2019s so hard like not to get sucked into it. Like I forgive him so easily. I was so pissed last night at 3, 4 in the morning. I was\u2026 an hour, I lost an hour of sleep in the middle of the night because I was like, \u201c[gasp] This is my only chance, he\u2019s finally talking to me. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD1\">was silent for 48 hours, now he\u2019s finally talking to me, let me grab it.\u201d And I was so angry, and like, wow, how immature. Like this wouldn\u2019t work anyways, even if this guy was single. How unhealthy is this? Good thing I have James. And then here he is talking dirty to me? [snaps fingers] I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD2\">to see him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Well, again, it\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s the power, the feelings and the sex and the\u2026 that are all kind of like\u2026 the sex is infused with so much need and feeling of, you know, that there\u2019s gonna be some real, real\u2026 uh\u2026 disclosing of feeling, and sharing, and something very essential to you. That\u2019s, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF1\">know, very, very eroticized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D1\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s something I can\u2019t feel with James yet. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D5\">CLIENT: But, I mean, like I went out Saturday night and my friends were asking me, \u201cOo, so tell us about this new guy.\u201d I couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off my face. And my friends are all single, it was two guys and a girl. And it\u2019s funny, because we all got together, and then after everyone spots someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D51\">they want to talk to they split. So the guys split, and Patrice and I split, and I was like her wingman. And so I had to\u2026 like she had a guy in mind, and he was with a friend, so I knew I would have to talk to the friend. Five minutes into the conversation I tell him\u2014like I weave it into the conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D52\">even, like I didn\u2019t even expect I\u2019d do that\u2014but I was just like, \u201cYeah, because I\u2019m just getting to someone. Like it\u2019s soon, but I think it\u2019s going well.\u201d And, \u201cHow about you, are you dating anyone?\u201d You know. And then five minutes into talking to this guy too he ends up telling me that he\u2019s in rehab <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D53\">and he\u2019s gotten into a lot of legal problems and that\u2019s why he keeps drinking water and not alcohol.

And I\u2019m just thinking to myself like, it\u2019s so hard to meet a good match. And I found a great one. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201D71\">wow, how lucky am I. And I started missing him. But I was having fun with my friends. And just like thinking about how much fun it\u2019ll be when they get to meet him and I get to bring him with me. You know. But if it\u2019s going so well why can\u2019t I just cut this thing off with Brian?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a one or the other kinda thing to you. And I don\u2019t know that they\u2026 like it contradicts anything, your attachment to Brian contradicts at all. In fact, to tell you the truth, like from\u2026 you know, just from the outside, I think you are talking about Brian in a different manner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DB\">CLIENT: I am?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s my sense, is that, I don\u2019t know, just the way\u2026 you know, revealed through the texts, the Valentine\u2019s Day texts, and like, \u201cHey, I need to get off the phone.\u201d Even if it\u2019s like a pretty intense conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:44:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s going on. But that doesn\u2019t mean\u2026 there\u2019s still something very alive in all that with Brian. And it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s kind of bookended this\u2026 so our talk today is bookended by your father\u2019s call, and like a lot of promises and not really feeling like it\u2019s delivering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E5\">THERAPIST: You know, this has a hell of a lot of meaning to you, and feeling for you. And I think one thing too is yeah, one element is that ongoing kind of desire to have a man that will fulfill\u2026 that will take care of that, that will kind of\u2026 take care of you. I mean, it\u2019s such a powerful experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E51\">I think. For men and for women, but it\u2019s certainly\u2026 you know, this is something central to women, that they find a man that really takes care of them. Like a father. Like a father did or didn\u2019t, but whatever, like some presence like that. Safety, security. And then there\u2019s the element of the erotic <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E52\">for it to you, and something that the dream is getting at, this dream is getting at, of torture, and, you know, a little boy there. I guess what came to mind to me was that sense of how it suggest maybe something about Brian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E7\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N201E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563375\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Well, I thought about how you characterize often so much the two sides of Brian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201EB\">CLIENT: Oh, like he\u2019s a little boy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201ED\">THERAPIST: One is the torture, and the other hand is the little boy.
