(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about friendships, and like what does it mean to be a friend, or to have a friendship, right? [0:01:04] Because I mean part of it is, like I\u2019m hanging out with Yvonne tonight, because we\u2019ve been friends for so long, right? But we don\u2019t have almost anything in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">common anymore. We met through an Internet community. I\u2019m used to wearing long sleeves (anyway) (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Got you; yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: And like for awhile, we had lot of common interests, and we\u2019re both doing feminist activacy things, and we were both in the process of leaving the church, and trying to figure out what this church (body) (ph) would like if we\u2019re not in the church anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Now she does like feminist activism and writing professionally, since that\u2019s her job. And I have all but walked away from that, especially online activism, because it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s toxic; it really is. There was a blow-up a couple of months ago that Yvonne was in the middle of; I don\u2019t know if you follow <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">this sort of thing on the Internet. [0:02:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: No,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: So [] is a professor of feminism at one of the universities; I don\u2019t remember, and I don\u2019t care which. Like not one of the big famous ones. And he was a very famous Internet (presence) (ph). But the thing is, he believed women of color, pretty viciously online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">A lot of the big name moneymaking white feminists, who gets paid to write for (inaudible at 0:02:53). And like what\u2019s her name; I can\u2019t even remember her first name; it doesn\u2019t matter; they\u2019re all horrible human beings. They all care about like making their money, instead of actually doing anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">that will make a difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So like sell-out activist or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: They\u2019re what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Like a sell-out activist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And like they bullied friends of mine, and they\u2019re just horrible. But they all backed up this guy, and he bullied woman after woman who told him he was being gross. Well, (chuckle) as it turns out, he attempted to murder his girlfriend. Then information came out that he had raped several <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">of his students taking class. And I was like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: But people were still taking his side and defending him, and saying that we should forgive him, because he\u2019s repented, and blah, blah, blah and all this like gross misuse of Christian language. It was just \u2013 anyway, so that\u2019s online feminist activism morals, and I won\u2019t be a part of it, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">it\u2019s a giant waste of time and energy. [0:03:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">But Yvonne is still in the middle of it; she\u2019s getting paid for it; she\u2019s doing it professionally. She has to deal with these people, because they\u2019re her colleagues, even though they\u2019re horrible to her and she hates them. There\u2019s not \u2013 and she\u2019s very much involved in the like religious world; she goes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">to conferences, and gives talks at these conferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">I mean it\u2019s great for her career, but again that\u2019s not my world, and so it\u2019s \u2013 and meanwhile, over here, I\u2019ve been getting into publishing, and editing, and writing, and certainly with a feminist (inaudible at 0:04:41), I do work on activacy stuff within the context of the publishing world.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562376\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">But it\u2019s very different, so when we get together, it\u2019s \u2013 she wants to dish gossip on like the horrible people on the mailing list. And I have no context for that. Then she asks me what\u2019s going on with my publishing stuff, but she has no context for that. [0:05:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">It\u2019s this horrible disconnect, and we haven\u2019t actually had a shared interest in like five years. Hanging out with her isn\u2019t any fun. So I\u2019m just wondering, (sigh) what am I doing here? Or for a less emotionally (inaudible at 0:05:26) example, years and years ago, when I was dating Phil, Phil\u2019s housemate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">had this friend Brady that she introduced me to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Brady and I hung out a couple of times, but he was in law school, and neither of us had a whole lot of time. Then I moved to Germany, then I moved to North Carolina, and we kind of fell out of touch. Then earlier this year, that was a big (inaudible at 0:05:49) in January, we ran into each other again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">and we\u2019re like, \u201cOh hey, this is cool. We should like totally get together.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">Then I reached out to him; I left him a message on his blog, and then he sent me an e-mail, and we e-mailed back and forth a couple of times. We got together after dinner, and like (pause) it was pretty clear he was so harboring a crush on me from like ten years ago. Now he keeps asking me out on things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">that like he\u2019s very careful not say data, but he\u2019s pretty clear that\u2019s what he wants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I feel guilty saying no, because I was enthusiastic about reinitiating our friendship like four months ago, but now it\u2019s like hanging out with him tonight (inaudible at 0:06:32), because he\u2019s kind of boring. He (sigh) doesn\u2019t have anything to talk about, except gossip about the people in his lives. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">And certainly with friends of mine, we talk about our other friends sometimes; Vanessa and I have talked about the whole (Kimberly) (ph) situation, [and it\u2019s an item] (ph) it feels like. But like there\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s not all we talk about, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">There\u2019s also \u2013 we talk about current events; we talk about books we\u2019ve read; we\u2019ve talked about \u2013 yeah. I don\u2019t know, it just feels like (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Sounds like you enjoy that with Vanessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, Vanessa is great. I wish she would move here, which might even be thinkable; she got tenure, which means it\u2019s much easier for her to move and find a job, since she can just about be hired with tenure. Although there aren\u2019t all that many jobs anywhere for her field. But \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">(inaudible at 0:07:42), like Brady is just \u2013 and maybe this is a little snobbish and a little elitist, but there\u2019s a level of just intellectual rigor I expect from my friends. But not expected; that I\u2019ve gotten used to, and he\u2019s not \u2013 he\u2019s a (inaudible at 0:08:02). I\u2019m a (chuckle) horrible person, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">I feel guilty about telling him I don\u2019t want to spend time with him. And I don\u2019t \u2013 I want not to feel guilty when I think, like I don\u2019t owe him my time. But I feel like I do in some ways. (pause) Because I was the one who left a comment on his blog, saying, \u201cYeah, we ran into each other at a bar; we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">should probably get together again.\u201d (pause) [0:09:05] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562376\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">Or maybe, an example that Fields equally frocks me, although coming from the other direction, it\u2019s Raheem\u2019s partner Matilda, and Matilda\u2019s quite with Uma. Often four lovely people, but when we do hang out, we seem to enjoy each other\u2019s company. Or I certainly enjoy there\u2019s; I hope that do mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">But I don\u2019t know how to go from like your people I know, because we have this mutual friend in common, to you\u2019re actually my friends now too. It just feels really weird, and awkward, and I don\u2019t know where the line is between like, this is a reasonable number of times to invite them over for dinner, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">or to hang out for coffee, versus like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re a creepy stalker and you need to stop.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I see. [0:10:23] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I feel like I missed Social Skills 101 in elementary school.

(pause) [0:12:00] (pause) [There\u2019re opportunities] (ph) that you feel (pause) some of this is driven I think, by your feeling like pretty in the dark about sort of tacit social signaling people do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Is it getting to sunny over there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: A little bit, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Is it just this one, you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s that one actually; it\u2019s reflecting off that glass building \u2013 [background noise at 0:12:48:00].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I got you; it\u2019s not that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: No. Yeah, no; the one behind me is fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Right, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Thank you.

I think you assume that other people really get that stuff often as well; but you don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: So that like Lucy (pause) if you kept inviting her, like she could be rolling her eyes saying, \u201cOh my God, hasn\u2019t she got the hint yet?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Or, you know, already be feeling like, \u201cI\u2019m [going to get] (ph) a friend independently of yours.\u201d And was not getting why you wouldn\u2019t get that already.

I don\u2019t get the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201331\">sense that you think of her as a bad person, or she being a jerk.
