I don\u2019t know.  (pause) I guess I don\u2019t know why. Like yesterday I was busy, but I wasn\u2019t so thrown off. I wasn\u2019t feeling too anxious.  (long pause) I wish I could better understand what exactly is bothering me or what I can do to help. (pause)  A lot of what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">comes to mind is just pushing myself to work more, to plan things after work, to keep myself preoccupied or not allowing myself to go from doing a lot to doing nothing. I just want to keep doing something. (pause)  That\u2019s kind of how I feel about this upcoming weekend. I just need to work or plan a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">bunch of things to go to or to do. I guess I\u2019m kind of hesitant. I guess I\u2019m always kind of pushing myself. [I can\u2019t help what] (ph?) makes me feel better, but I wish it was more natural or something I wanted to do, not [something I have to] (ph?) push myself to go do. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re having a reaction to the kind of chance that you can talk here about whatever you want; there is something about that making you anxious and your response is to think about keeping busy and staying focused on doing things. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)  I also worry about when I have free time what I\u2019m going to do or what I should be doing. I feel like I\u2019m also keeping (inaudible at 00:08:14). I\u2019m not trying to be distracted. I feel like I need time to work on all of the things that are bothering me.  I feel like when I spend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">time with people, those things will pile up and I guess I just don\u2019t want any more on my plate because I just feel that I\u2019m going to have to behave or do things for others. It\u2019s a lot of extra energy for things that I feel like I should be doing.  (long pause) I guess I really don\u2019t know how to balance it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: In a way, you feel a little bit closed in by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) Talking to people or interacting makes me feel extremely insecure or just worried. I need reassurance.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s not like enjoyable or lighthearted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I guess in some ways it can feel more overwhelming and kind of more stressful than work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right, because it\u2019s always there \u2013 like what\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t this be better?  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: And I guess specifically in response to moments where you feel at odds with the other person? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: A little bit. (long pause)  It just kind of feels like I\u2019m reliant or I\u2019m the one who is needing help or whatever, but it never seems like the opposite, like what are they thinking about this? Like obligated or something.  (pause) I kind of go back and forth with leaving it alone, but then also <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">needing reassurance, [but not too much I don\u2019t think.] (ph?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I guess the problems with feeling dependent in that way are, for one, making you feel kind of crummy by yourself, sort of ashamed; and the other, anticipating that people will walk away or leave in some fashion because you\u2019re too much for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Right. Or I don\u2019t bring anything to them or to their worth or enjoyment to the relationship; it\u2019s kind of negative.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562216\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s as though the other person is going to spend their time shoring you up, and not have a chance to kind of relate to you in some way that\u2019s going to be satisfying.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really know what to do about it. I guess I feel like I kind of have to try to make it better or I should be really nice or feel pressured to make it more enjoyable, but it\u2019s not natural. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I guess there is some [giving up] (ph?) there where you\u2019re really at or suppressing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I guess I\u2019m just kind of all over the place, it seems like, resenting or I need to (inaudible at 00:21:04) more or feeling needy. I would kind of like to stabilize that or  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like it feels like this fragmented way of experiencing things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I guess I was thinking about your description of yourself where you\u2019re worried that other people are going to feel like you\u2019re just kind of work. I was thinking about a few things. One is how you feel with your work, which I imagine it is a paralyzing sense that you feel like with the items <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">on your to-do list, you\u2019re focusing on them and getting through them and staying on top of them \u2013 in a way sort of hold the work together, like it\u2019s kind of stressful and it feels good to get things done.  I think it makes you feel like things are secure at work. I guess I was thinking about maybe you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">imagine that you feel like that to other people and maybe in the way you relate to me, I guess, in some literal sense, like this is my work; but I guess what comes to me is that you\u2019re, in a way, imagining and projecting that I have a particular experience of it, which is [like yours] (ph?) that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">here.  Not so much like I\u2019m relating to you or finding it fulfilling, but holding you together. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:26:45) my friends, but I\u2019ve not thought too much about it. It\u2019s just like your work. But I guess in terms of it being fulfilling, I guess I worry that I\u2019m a downer or something or not easy to deal with ever.  (long pause) I just thought of this, but the UNC interview, I prepped <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">with Melissa and I prepped with Marlowe and I did it twice, first round and then with Marlowe I kind of (inaudible at 00:29:46), exactly what to say and like polished it off better. Something about prepping or knowing what to say helps a lot.  I guess that\u2019s kind of how I feel. What I need to do to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">go out or talking to friends, one-on-one or something, is I need to prep or think of things to talk about or questions to ask \u2013 prepare myself. (pause) I guess it\u2019s not more natural.  I\u2019m not very good at conversation or thinking of things to talk about. (pause) Another aspect of it, as an example, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">is me needing them. Marlowe might come to me for help for work stuff, but nothing outside of it. I\u2019m kind of the same when I\u2019ve got a problem.  I\u2019m not in a place to give help or be rational. I\u2019m always the needy one. 00:32:15). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re kind of a burden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And I guess they\u2019re not worried that they\u2019re not really getting much out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) Or I feel like I\u2019m kind of always needing something or there is no enjoyment. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t view friendship that way. Yeah, there is a little bit of that, but it shouldn\u2019t be the main focus.  I feel right now like it\u2019s how it seems, like I\u2019m always needing reassurance or needing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">help or what should I do?

Or my hobbies are kind of stripped away and I\u2019m just left with things I should do, so I don\u2019t have anything that someone could come to talk to me about or something or [even anything] to talk about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Like there\u2019s no personal \u201cyou\u201d in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Right.

It\u2019s not quite the same as wearing clothing like it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">like other people are, which fits them and they picked out or had a preference for or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Right.
