Oh, there\u2019s that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh.

I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I feel a little desperate to resolve this thing of mine, because I mean, you know, there are all sorts of things that will take time and energy to kind of patch through, and it just complicates everything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">You know, I was being kind of an ass. Maybe I was being a little difficult. She was tired, I was exhausted. I mean, I wasn\u2019t sleeping. And I just feel like \u2013 I feel, rightly or wrongly, I am not sure whether this is constructive or not, but I feel \u2013 and this is something that I felt about things in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">the past, so I\u2019m a little bit \u2013 I\u2019m skeptical, wary of it, of this impulse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I just feel, like, if only this could be resolved, then everything else would be easier. You know, figuring out the, you know, how to balance Jennie\u2019s (ph) needs and my needs, and how to communicate our needs effectively. And I don\u2019t know, I just feel like my (pause) \u2013 I don\u2019t even want to call it intuition, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">because, again, I\u2019m wary of it. My fantasy, probably the most accurate representation of it, is just that A, it\u2019s feasible to deal with this in isolation from everything else, and B, that it is (pause) a complication without dispensing, which none of the others can be addressed independently.  Anyway, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">(pause) but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Where \u2013 is it applying for jobs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Applying for jobs, but it\u2019s not \u2013 I mean, as \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like being in a workplace somehow or being (pause) \u2013 I don\u2019t know. For somebody with this peculiar malady, if I\u2019m not being too forward in calling it a malady, for somebody with this peculiarity \u2013 I won\u2019t beg any questions. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">I\u2019ve gotten quite a bit done, but I just can\u2019t get anything \u2013 it\u2019s like I\u2019m drying up without addressing it. I feel like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m rambling a little bit. Yeah, so it\u2019s not just applying for jobs, it\u2019s also just kind of imagining myself being \u2013 imagining myself functional within this particular <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">kind of a setting, this peculiar kind of social arrangement\/relationship institution (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I just feel completely mastered by it. (pause) I feel completely mastered by it, and I feel no mastery of it. And that combination somehow is insufficient, like, I don\u2019t know. Every incentive, there\u2019s every incentive to move on it, and I can\u2019t move on. I\u2019m just kind of immobilized. So I feel frustrated, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">and I feel kind of desperate, and I feel sad about the pressure, and tension, and stress that it\u2019s introducing into our lives. Again, as if, you know, these things could be isolated from each other, I\u2019m aware that that\u2019s not the way it probably works in practice, but that\u2019s the way it feels.  That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">the way it feels, that\u2019s kind of how it\u2019s feeling right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562340\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">It was a really hard thing to really \u2013 and, in the end, I mean, it was \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I felt Jennie and I were just not communicating or rather; we were communicating in a very tense, you know, way that led to more tension rather than relieving it. And finally, we went to bed, and I was mad, and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">was mad. And before we went to sleep, (inaudible at 00:05:35), I just kind of reached across, and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk,\u201d you know, and we embraced each other and it was sweet, and we both went to bed that way, went to sleep that way. So, (pause) you know, there\u2019s some \u2013 I think there\u2019s good awareness <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">on both of our parts that, you know, there are ways of interacting, that we have access to that, you know, help buffer us and our relationship from these particular kinds of stresses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">On the other hand, it\u2019s just such an energy sink, and I personally, and Jennie, and the two of us in tandem just have such scarce resources of energy, that I just feel like, \u201cGod, if only. If only.\u201d (pause) And yet, it\u2019s a small thing that we\u2019re talking about on the face of it. You know, frankly, applying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">\u2013 it\u2019s not even getting any of these jobs. Like, if I were systematically applying for them, I would feel better, Jennie would feel better. We would both feel a little bit more sane. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what the issue is, honestly. (pause) I mean, I know what all of these things we\u2019ve talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">about are. I know what the dynamics that we\u2019ve discussed are, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m just \u2013 I feel kind of mastered by it, and frustrated, and almost scared. (inaudible at 00:07:08) scared. Jennie\u2019s scared. I mean, she said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m scared about our financial situation.\u201d And she\u2019s right <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">to be, and I\u2019m sympathetic to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">I\u2019m sympathetic to all of it. I mean, like, I\u2019m sympathetic to her point of view, except, you know, to the degree that she\u2019s been sort of grudging about the sorts of things that we\u2019ve talked about. But, you know, I mean, from her point of view, I think this is [my read-it] (ph), that I probably articulate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">this in some way or another. You know, it\u2019s like a premise of her agreeing to it was that by now, you know, I\u2019d be well into the job search. I think that\u2019s part of where she\u2019s coming from. (pause) And she doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m into it at all, which is truth (ph). It\u2019s funny, not surprising, but funny <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">at some level that I have no problem articulating this to you.  I would never articulate [or explain] (ph) it to Jennie (laughing) at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Just that \u2013 know I\u2019m nowhere near \u2013 I mean, just being sort of frank and unvarnished about the difficulty that I\u2019m having. It\u2019s \u2013 you know, there\u2019s a lot of tension between us over it, so \u2013 I wish (pause) somehow, and I don\u2019t know what role this plays in all of this, I\u2019m very (pause) \u2013 I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">I just feel ashamed in \u2013 about the trouble it has caused us. So it\u2019s harder for me to be frank, and explicit, and unvarnished about it. I feel, (pause) I don\u2019t know if accused is quite right, I feel ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, one thing that\u2019s striking to me about all of it is in a way, like, the problem is the classic problem you\u2019ve had of about not being able to get through the job search and particularly not being able to do some task that, as you say, [on their phase] (ph) (inaudible at 00:09:28) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">whatever, you know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562340\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: (laughing) You can explain (inaudible at 00:09:32), it\u2019s not worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: (laughing) No, it was agreement that I was going to go into.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: But, (pause) you know, aren\u2019t conceptually difficult, aren\u2019t, you know, that ownerist (ph) in and of itself to do, da, da, da. So, there\u2019s all of that, which is how it\u2019s (inaudible at 00:09:53). And on the other hand, (pause) like, in other ways, there\u2019s really not much sign of Jeffrey (ph). <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">Like, I haven\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Signs \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: ... seen it in here, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: And usually, when I\u2019m Jeffreying, I manifest it in my recap, as well? Is that what it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there\u2019s, like, a sense of \u2013 you seem just sort free or more open, easier with me about it. You\u2019re, like \u2013 I mean, you\u2019re kind of clearly in touch with things we\u2019ve talked about to do with this, as best as I can tell, and have generally been so, as we talked about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I know there was some kind of shutting down stuff that happened with Jennie, around the \u2013 like, the beginning of last week. I think we had talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: But it wasn\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: It was different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s nothing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It didn\u2019t last long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it didn\u2019t last long at the time. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And mostly, you\u2019ve been, it seems like pretty clear about (inaudible at 00:10:55), to kind of on top of, engaged with...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: ... like, her, what\u2019s going on with you and her, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m not \u2013 yeah. Yeah, I mean, one \u2013 finish your thought. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: [You were talking about] (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: No, it just \u2013 it usually doesn\u2019t work like that, you know, with those two things being so different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I guess my...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: [I\u2019m not sure] (ph) what to make it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess my proposition or, you know, speculation would be that (pause) it\u2019s different because it\u2019s Jennie. You know, it\u2019s not the great beyond, you know, the workplace, colleagues, people who I feel less secure with and more threatened by. It\u2019s somebody that I\u2019m intimate with. And also, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">I mean, it\u2019s like this mode of resolution or immediate resolution last night, I think is really important in understanding that difference.  The difference between Jeffrey and whatever, you know, sub-Jeffrey is or Jeffrey sub one, that, you know, there\u2019s a channel of communication that you have with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">an intimate partner that is just not possible. Just reassurance, mutual reassurance, communication, kind of re-establishment of the connection that is there, and that is very strong, and established between the two of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">And, in fact, I mean, frankly, it\u2019s this mode of communication that I think sealed the deal with Jennie and I. I remember very early on in our dating, she was feeling bad. I think she had a migraine. And we just did this thing, which we still do, where, you know, she would lie on the couch and I lay <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">on, you know, a fairly narrow couch holding her, and we just kind of cuddled like that. And, you know, we weren\u2019t talking.  She couldn\u2019t \u2013 she was really having a bad migraine, and we just sat there, you know, with this other kind of communication. So that \u2013 you know, my speculation would be that having <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">that channel and having that, you know, security of that connection is the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562340\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well, it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Whatever it\u2019s worth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: That means the channel must have grown stronger and more secure or something, because, you know, there\u2019s been plenty of Jeffreys throughout the relationship with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: You mean between her and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Because I mean, what we\u2019re talking about right now, it\u2019s between me and her. This \u2013 you know, the difficulty presents it by my inhibition against being in a workplace.  I mean, I think that\u2019s \u2013 you know, it\u2019s like we didn\u2019t talk about the immediate <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">task, which is, you know, doing the job applications, but you\u2019re quite right. You know, it\u2019s really about I\u2019m measuring (ph) myself, you know, in the initial phases of the workplace, which is the application process, the subsequent phases \u2013 it\u2019s like all of these interactions that gave \u2013 clask (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">in this rubric, this kind of classic \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s as if I have just be acculturated in a social environment and \u2013 that\u2019s very discrepant from this one, this kind of, you know, bureaucratized, boudoir (ph) existence. And I have a really difficult time imagining, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200833\">and unaccountably and unreasonably and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:58) is the word? And that\u2019s something even bigger actually, than not only job applications and not only a job search, but a job itself, per se. It sounds more like sociocultural ego. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: I \u2013 maybe I\u2019m just \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: And maybe you\u2019re not.

It\u2019s not my applications. It\u2019s, like, this inhibition and the difficulty with it, and the worry about the effect that it might have on my connection with somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s not between somebody, and then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not between me and Phil. It\u2019s not between me and Luke or Justine or Kevin, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s between me and Jennie. And this is the one relationship where \u2013 and I guess one of the fears that I have is that I could fuck it up, by just presuming too much, if you know what I mean.  In other <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">words, you know, laying too much on us, and just kind of going with the flow and not addressing something that needs to be addressed, because I feel secure. You know, so paradoxically, my sense of security could endanger, you know, the very thing that I feel so secure in. And we\u2019re not at that point <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200932\">yet, but, you know, I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: It is serious business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: It\u2019s serious business, and I feel a little \u2013 you know, just getting back to the head of the hour, I feel a little desperate about it. (pause) And Jennie feels desperate, I sense, about how to communicate with me, because, you know, she is sympathetic. She doesn\u2019t know \u2013 understand what\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">on, and yet, it\u2019s been years now.

I don\u2019t know that I would say it\u2019s between you, it can say it isn\u2019t, in the way that it would\u2019ve been between you and Phil or you and Kevin. It seems to me actually that it\u2019s between you and your fantasy life about jobs and job searches. Do you know what I mean?

And I think we agree that Jeffrey is, you know, a reaction that I have to certain kinds of relationships. And by not entering into the job search, by definition, I have no <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">relationship with any individual human being, you know, associated with that process. I do have a relationship with Jennie. You see what I\u2019m saying? In other words, you know, what would potentially, according to my speculation here, trigger, you know, bertian behavior or whatever affect would be, I\u2019m, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">you know, actually doing it, paradoxically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, I think there is Jeffreyian behavior, which is that you\u2019re not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: ... getting the job search, and you\u2019re also not... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: But you \u2013 you\u2019re...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: ...talking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: You\u2019re making a differentiation between the actual, you know, kind of avoidant behavior and something associated with it, which includes, you know, just not \u2013 inattention to my immediate environment and, you know. And there\u2019s something \u2013 there\u2019s some of that that probably I could point to. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">you know, my room is kind of messy. It\u2019s not, like, a catastrophe, but it\u2019s messy-ish. So, you know, there\u2019s a little bit of that, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not full-on. And my hypothesis is that it\u2019s not full-on because the kinds of relationships that feel very tenuous and that feel, you know, a significant <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">risk of hurting me, have not yet been initiated.  The relationship that is very present, between me and Jennie, feels more secure. And therefore...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: So there\u2019s really a sort of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: ...

Yeah. I see. So, you\u2019re saying, like, (pause) in a way, (pause) you know, if we have a room called, \u201cThe Job Room,\u201d it\u2019s what happens in there that can cause you to Jeffrey outside, but at the moment, you\u2019re just keeping the door shut?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Well, you know, if Jennie and I were not in a committed relationship with \u2013 I mean, (inaudible at 00:22:54), whatever, you know, married, for all intensive purposes, and we were dating or something, then it might well be that that \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s not \u2013 I\u2019m theorizing.  It\u2019s not about, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">you know, the kind of relationship that it is, but rather the security and the kind of security and the durability or reliability of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562340\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

And, you know, I probably would\u2019ve been more Jeffrey had our appointment been yesterday around 8:00 <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">p.m., but whatever. I\u2019ve clearly recovered with a reasonable amount of alacrity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Right. (pause) Yeah, well, in your \u2013 (pause) I think, also, that you do seem to be \u2013 I mean, not doing the job search, and I think also, like, not talking about the nuts and bolts of it here, (pause) seem to be ways that you\u2019re just keeping the door shut on that part of your life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Well, let\u2019s talk about the nuts and bolts of it here. I\u2019m not sure that I \u2013 I mean, I have no problem with it. You know, it involves crafting, you know, the CV for a specific \u2013 you know, it\u2019s in conformity with a specific strategy of going after, you know, academic \u2013 I mean, hopefully relatively <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">senior academic, I don\u2019t know, bureaucracy jobs in the Providence area, you know, that would allow us to stay here and let Jennie pursue \u2013 I mean, I think she\u2019s feeling \u2013 so, I\u2019m diverting the conversation. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">OK. Let\u2019s ignore for the moment how she\u2019s feeling. But, you know, so that would emphasize, you know, my knowledge and familiarity with, you know, academic job structure and my commitment to, you know, maximizing the experience and, you know, of the students and the academic community. Things, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">I can certainly craft a convenient fiction about it. It would not take an enormous amount of time. And then, it would involve, you know, basically going both on Listserv, [where these things] (ph), like, chronicle higher education, and probably that would be enough, actually.  Chronicle higher education <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C12\">and just, you know, finding all the people who have postings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">And I\u2019ve also mentioned (inaudible at 00:26:06), and quite frankly, at this stage of the game, taking \u2013 you know, applying to everything, you know, in a wide swath from, you know, very relatively senior roles to possibly temporary, but relatively less responsible roles. I mean, you know, we need money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">And my investment in (pause) this as a career path is not sufficient. I think that I would be grossly dissatisfied with something that felt unworthy of me. I don\u2019t know how that works in practice, and I don\u2019t know how much of a fear that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get the things that I feel, you know, are <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">worth my while on how much of a role that plays in my reticence to even find out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Would there be networking too or would this mostly be just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">(crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Well, there\u2019s a rub. There would be, there would have \u2013 I mean, networking.

(pause) I think \u2013 if I were to innumerate all of the things that feel like obstacles to initiating this process, it\u2019s probably that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: The networking part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: With people in my existing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019d feel like the hardest...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: That feels...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: ... fucking (ph) thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: ... very difficult. And what feels most difficult somehow, is the sense of disclosure. Like, I feel safer with nobody knowing exactly what I\u2019m up to. And that is a very pervasive impulse or just way of interacting with the world, that being exposed feels very unsafe. (pause) I don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">that means, but somehow, like, when I think about not wanting to make contact with people... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s why now (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Part of \u2013 you know, I mean, guess it could be described as not wanting to test whether they would actually be responsive to me and helpful, whatever, but somehow what really feels scary is letting them know that I\u2019m (pause) asking for something and, you know, that there may or not be a process <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">that eventuates in me, being embraced by somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I imagine that touches for you on the shame. You feel like a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, or, you know, that is the shame or something. In other words, you know, there\u2019s \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s kind of a performative utterance, in the sense that it\u2019s the expression of the shame.

I thought you meant the reaching out itself.

And (long pause)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: I mean, it\u2019s interesting, when I was applying for academic jobs, the difficult part of it was writing cover letters, you know, because the CV was written.  It wasn\u2019t like I had to reproduce the CV each time, but writing cover letters. (pause) Now, that doesn\u2019t seem so daunting somehow, although, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">maybe if I were actually doing it, it would feel very daunting. (chuckles) But it\u2019s the other stuff that feels scary. And there\u2019s no reason for it to feel scary. I don\u2019t know, man (ph). I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">Here\u2019s another, you know, just clear tangentialiary (ph) that I have, and that\u2019s that our conversations are somehow, you know, making it easier for me to evade this necessary task, rather than facilitating the resolution of the admission.  That, you know, we could yak about it forever, you know, without <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">really making a dent in whatever\u2019s going on. I think \u2013 (pause) I say this, I think fairly matter-of-factly. You know, in other words, maybe in the past I felt, you know, sort of \u2013 at least had some kind of transference, you know, relationship, in which...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Well, I think they\u2019re \u2013 (inaudible at 00:32:34), it\u2019s a little different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: It seems to me that you started to look and sound somewhat different as you did start to talk about the nuts and bolts, and particularly about reaching out to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: In other words, more Jeffrey or what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Maybe a smidge.

I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F1\">feel as if I have no inhibition to, you know, addressing any aspect to it, including talking about it.

Well, I \u2013 what I had understood, again, you know, this is complex, I suppose.

If I had thought about it, and, you know, my reluctance to give it significant thought, it wouldn\u2019t have made as much sense as it seemed to. But, you know, it wasn\u2019t purely, you know, avoidance behavior on my part. One interesting question might <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F1\">be why I feel so \u2013 you know, why I\u2019m putting so much emphasis on distinguishing these two phenomenon.  I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but, you know, it \u2013 (pause) I don\u2019t know.

But anyway, I\u2019m not avoiding it now. (pause) So now, you know, what\u2019s the next move? Having <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201831\">successfully opened it up at the cost of, you know, some fluidity in my narrative and, you know, at the cost of some sense of equanimity, and some uncertainty, and \u2013 in our interaction.
