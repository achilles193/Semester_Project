I don\u2019t know about this. I got called impromptu to deliver flowers today. I guess Lebanese Day is overloaded because the marathon and people send flowers to each other. So, I\u2019m doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Which, which florist do you do it for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Providence City Florist.

I know we, we brought up the whole issue of, of going off insurance and everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: And, so, I realized that I probably didn\u2019t do a good job of explaining what, what the story was with the, with the core days and everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Why? I understood sufficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: But, I don\u2019t know what would happen. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d have to go to one meeting or what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess it might depend on, on what you feel like you can, you can afford.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t even afford what we\u2019re doing right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What do you do for money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m delivering flowers, occasionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay.

Yeah. Yeah. Well, here\u2019s where, here\u2019s, I mean they, they pay for $50 for each, each meeting and, and I mean what, what I can do is I can, I mean I can just keep it at the, at the $90, but that would mean you would have to come up with $40 a session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: $40 a session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s a little steep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: And, you know, if, if you can\u2019t find, if you can\u2019t find work in time for June, what we could do is, well, I don\u2019t know what your plan is. I mean are you planning on trying to find more work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to apply at a few places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Just more than I... (inaudible at 00:02:52)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: The other thing I will say is, like, if it comes to the point that we get to June and we, and we haven\u2019t, we haven\u2019t found something or we haven\u2019t found another solution to it, I think what I could do is I could, you know, do one of two things and maybe I\u2019ll think about it a little bit more. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">Either have you carry a balance, if you feel comfortable with that or, or to try to figure out. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to think about that. You think of stuff too. What you feel we should do too. It might be, it might be that another thing is you might have to come down. If it comes down to it, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200512\">having to cut one of the two out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, it, it might seem obnoxious to you, but, but for me $20 for me is like 50 percent of my discretionary income. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not making any money. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Right. But, once I get famous, we\u2019ll have sessions like every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: (laughter) Why stop at every day? How about twice a day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: (laughter) I\u2019ll just put you on retainer. I went to, I injured me knee a little bit, so I went to, I tried to change to a different like medical place nearer to where I live, but there\u2019s a lot of paperwork and for like Mass General you have to wait like six weeks for them to like process you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B1\">and like get you in to their system or something. It\u2019s a weird process and like every hospital around is like Mass General or if they\u2019re not Mass General, they\u2019re not taking patients or you have to like, you have to jump through hoops basically to, to do it. So, it\u2019s just easier for me if I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B2\">be seen is to go to the place where my dad works. Though I don\u2019t see him as a doctor. So, I went there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099704\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: This is for your leg? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. For my leg. So, I went there just to, just to get a checkup. You know, I, I know people from my dad\u2019s office because I used to walk there before practice and hang out for a bit. So, they sort of know me and we had sort of friendly conversations, but I, you know, the last two times I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">gone there, I haven\u2019t stopped in to see my dad. And this time, especially, I, I sort of felt disinclined to, to visit him. So, it\u2019s kind of an unusual position where, you know, I felt sort of, like, realizing the I felt an urge to sort of deprive him of, of contact with me. Almost as a, like in a spiteful <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F2\">way. Though I\u2019m, I\u2019m not sure it, it hurts him as much as it does me because I, I love my father and I think he loves me too, but like I was saying last time, I don\u2019t think he really respects me at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Along those lines, I mean my mother called me like two days ago. Last night, actually and she was saying are you okay, are you okay? I just don\u2019t respond to those kinds of text messages and then she calls. So, and I answer and she said are you okay and I said, yeah, I\u2019m fine. Just a general <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">question she was asking me. She asked if I could come late last night, so that I could drive both of them to the airport this morning because they were flying out to pick up my brother and they\u2019re returning to a different airport. So, it would be easier for them to get to their jobs on Saturday if I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200632\">drove them early in the morning and then they could fly back to the airport and then just somehow it would be easier because they don\u2019t have a car left at, at Norwood. They\u2019re flying back to Liverpool or something. It was sort of an inversion of, of what had happened when I was walking the marathon <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200633\">route. Where I was, it was late at night and I, I needed assistance and it didn\u2019t come and it was for something that was very important to me and this time she was asking, you know, whether I could do this because it would make it easier for them to, to go out there. And, so I just, I was irritated <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200634\">without really understanding why and I just, I said yeah, sure, I\u2019ll come tonight and sort of hung up basically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">But, I, I thought about it for like, I don\u2019t know, nine minutes, and I just decided to, to text back that I\u2019m, I\u2019m not coming. She called and said why and I said I don\u2019t want to and that\u2019s it. And, so, I mean I felt quite a bit better after doing that. It\u2019s unusual. Like, I feel like I, I felt this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">sort of transition in, in realizing that, that my parents weren\u2019t really there to help me with things that were important to me. I think I sort of passed in to a new, a new phase, but with that new phase, you know, I\u2019m like I think it was strange because my mother, she texted me before any of this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200652\">but after that, that realization, she texted me something like do, do good things in your life. Which that seemed to like serendipitously acknowledge the transition that I, that I felt myself without any other conversation. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099704\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">I hate talking about texts, but that\u2019s, that\u2019s how it\u2019s happening, but afterwards, it\u2019s almost like this claw back. Like, she wants to find some excuse to like pull me back in or a, and in a sense control me or, or control her access to me and trying to get me back in to that dependency. I mean she <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">tried to get me to watch the dog and all these little things that maybe they need help with, but I suspect that it\u2019s not really urgent. I went in to, the day I went to, to get my knee fixed I went home because I needed access to my health care. I\u2019m on father\u2019s health insurance, at least until, until <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">I turn 26 and so, I needed the, the forms. So, I went in there. Almost like a spy. Like, I went in and I said hello to my dog. That wasn\u2019t spy like, but I, I sort of went through the desk pretty efficiently and found an unopened envelope. I opened it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I might be a violation of federal law, but it\u2019s just it had all our insurance names on it and so I just got the numbers that I needed and got out of there and filed my taxes a week late. I went to the office. In the office, people were saying hello to me and I told them about my knee and why it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">injured and they said oh, that\u2019s great. We\u2019re happy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And, they said, you know, can I say to your, are you going to say hi to your dad and I said no. They said can I say hi for you because of this whole confidentiality thing and I said yeah, sure. You know, I\u2019m not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">to visit him in his office, you know, where he doesn\u2019t have a picture of me. Where, you know, it\u2019s all on, on his terms. He wouldn\u2019t see me when I needed something, and, so I\u2019m not going to go in there and just, even though I want to see him, I\u2019m not going to go in there. I mean he called me afterwards <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200693\">and he was, he was sort of bubbly. It was painful because he\u2019s, he\u2019s a positive person, but he called me afterwards and he, he said hey, so they told me you were in the office today. You know, no, no duplicity about it. I mean, he\u2019s like you\u2019re injured a little bit from walking and I just gave like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200694\">one word answers because I wasn\u2019t going to talk about it. It\u2019s not, you know, he, he had a chance to... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: To share something, but he, he wouldn\u2019t. He can\u2019t do it, except on like his, his time is his time. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t cross that bridge anymore. I can\u2019t believe him. I don\u2019t think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. Yeah. Even though you want, you want that, but if it comes late it kind of feels like, I imagine you might feel like a bit of a defeat to, to kind of tell him at that point. Even if you might want to on some level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It is, yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean didn\u2019t get anything I wanted out of it. Yeah. I mean, I\u2019d just like to see and it\u2019s weird. I, I don\u2019t want to put like little roadblocks, like artificial roadblocks in the way, but I\u2019m not sure what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: But, in some way, if you, if you capitulate you will feel like you have lost the opportunity to do something, to shift something<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah and I mean it\u2019s going to come up again. I mean, I\u2019m going to have opportunities to see him and maybe if it\u2019s not related to my injury or anything, which it\u2019s pretty minor, but, you know, if it\u2019s not related in any way, I\u2019ll be fine with it. But, it\u2019s, it\u2019s strange. I, I don\u2019t feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">I can, you know, join my parents or spend time with them and maintain my individuality.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099704\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

As you say, almost like if you, in order to have contact with them is, is it based upon like you losing your individuality or your mom putting calls in to you and sort of saying hey, do something for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And, if you do that, then you would lose the sense of like, well, what about what you respect in me as somebody that\u2019s an adult that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I mean that day she called me to watch the dog or whatever I\u2019m thinking okay, I\u2019ve got to, you know, I have to take out an enterprising and I have this, this and this to do and then she calls sort of like on cue. It\u2019s like can you take care of the dog? So, I just don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">say anything about what to do. I, I like my dog. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that I should be spending time on though. Like, going home and staying there with the dog. I mean what was that? I had a nightmare. (pounding noise) You following the play offs at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: You mean the NBA?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Brooklyn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Brooklyn\u2019s not playing so well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Okay. I mean they had a good finish to the season, but they lost to Chicago. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they lost, so they\u2019re down two to one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Two to one. I signed up for like ten fantasy leagues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You were saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: So, I won seven of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: How\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: What is it? A playoff based league? Is it based on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: No, it just ends at the regular season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: So, but I, I found a new play off league thing. It\u2019s like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You can do fantasy based off the playoff statistics?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think you have to like, you pick one player per day or something. So, I\u2019m doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, actually, I won six of the leagues. There\u2019s ten, sometimes more, but there\u2019s at least ten in each league. I won six. I won the, I got second in the seventh one, but the seventh one, one of the guys, he had like two teams and then he, he traded all of the good people for like LeBron James <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">and whatever to this one team, so he had like seven. So, I got second that week, but I count it as first. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: You count is as first. (laughter) He should be DQ\u2019d, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. It\u2019s a struggle though. Like, fantasy to me represents like everything about evaluating and sort of, not superficially, but, but discriminating in a very calculated way and, you know, the discriminations, they may not have relevance in the real world, but they, they\u2019re still, they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">satisfying in some way or you can arrogate some sort of pleasure from it. But, it\u2019s, so, it\u2019s something I\u2019m somewhat adept at, but I, you know, the whole thing with ratings and it\u2019s sort of a flash bulb or I don\u2019t know, like almost a Latin quality of, of nonchalance. It\u2019s something I\u2019m slowly drifting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B12\">away from and losing contact with, quite literally. I guess figuratively as well. Yeah, and literally too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099704\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: What has been the, what has been the situation? Have you seen her since she, she has moved out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: She has moved out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: And, have you, do you have any contact with her any longer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: No. None.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Oh. Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I told her, her fianc\u00e9 everything about what happened. And, also what I suspect had happened between her Edgar. So, I\u2019m not sure she knew that before she left, but she probably found out. Her fianc\u00e9 was asking me. You know, that\u2019s something, I mean I don\u2019t, I feel sort of dubious about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well, I felt like he had a right to the truth, but at the same time, you know, what I considered the truth included my suspicions about rates and Edgar. I mean I guess it\u2019s up to him to judge, but I still felt almost like an informant. I was reduced in some way to, I don\u2019t think it was motivated <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">by spite, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: You know. What do you think? What, what lead you to want to tell him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Probably a desire to have her, her stay, maybe at the time. I mean this is if that relationship broke up then I mean she might stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: She might stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: But, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s one way to fight for her, I suppose. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think, I mean she is manipulative, but there is still, there is something about someone who\u2019s manipulative with me. It\u2019s still a relationship you\u2019re sure of. You know, I mean it\u2019s, it\u2019s satisfying to have a girl climb up on top of you and just do like do what she wants. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">nice. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Well it is contact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s, it\u2019s even if it\u2019s not this, I think, even if it\u2019s not the best relationship, it\u2019s reliable. It\u2019s absolutely reliable to be used by somebody. It\u2019s just so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, yet you\u2019re saying about like your folks that there\u2019s, that they, that like in a way yeah, you can be used as the reliable, dependent guy to go home, but you don\u2019t want to be used that way. Or, the guy that will kind of, you know, take on like a son role in a particular <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">light, but you\u2019re trying to establish something else beyond that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: If, if I do take on a, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. With my parents, I don\u2019t feel, I don\u2019t think I can be reliable and I don\u2019t think if I were, they would, it would, that it still wouldn\u2019t be stable in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Oh. Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: No. Not at all. It\u2019s impossible to have a stable relationship with my mother, especially. Though, the episode with, with my father. You know, I feel like I, I hope I don\u2019t sound like I\u2019m blaming him, because I accept his, his decision not to participate. It\u2019s only indicative of or it helps to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">clarify a sort of pattern I hadn\u2019t really realized before. But, I, I also, I wonder whether I, I\u2019ve sort of piled on to my mother over the years in that, in a way, all of this is good, I mean I\u2019m just digging up for you, but I mean piled on to my mother in a way to try and conspire against her with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D92\">my father. You know, try and get my, try to participate with my father in something. You know. So, I wonder if, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: When you say pile on your mother what do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099704\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: I mean just sort of, I mean in criticizing her there would be a oneness with him I suppose. I don\u2019t know. I remember particularly when my first parents first learned about Birmingham. I mean they found out I, they found it before I did actually. I was an inhabited island for that summer, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">I came back for the weekend and they were there and they, said oh, my mother said, I\u2019m so sorry. You can do this, this, this. You should really, you\u2019ve got to keep moving up. She was totally right, but I was not prepared to hear that. She was saying like, you know, there\u2019s this writer\u2019s colony in Vermont. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD2\">You\u2019ve got to keep moving. You can\u2019t let this bring you down. I wasn\u2019t ready to hear that and I remember just dismissing her and walking with my father almost like the emperor invader and she was sort of like, she was off on the side like some vice admiral or something. I, I, and I said something dismissive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD3\">I dismissed her verbally in some way and started talking with my dad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">I don\u2019t know. You know. It\u2019s a possibility that for whatever reason, that my mother hasn\u2019t been very stable. And, you know, I have criticized her. Partly by her own standards, the standards she, she raised me to, but, you know, I wonder whether part of the reason is to try to... I don\u2019t know. Try to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">join in league with my father. I have no idea. The fact was that my dad just wasn\u2019t around for me. He does his work. I mean, he\u2019s a doctor. He\u2019s a good doctor. That\u2019s what he does all the time. So. I don\u2019t think he even takes vacation though he has the options. Also, I found out that my dad\u2019s a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">better off than I, looking through those tax forms, I found out that my dad\u2019s a lot better off than I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: What did that mean to you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well, a couple of things. I mean it didn\u2019t really affect me. It\u2019s just my idea of him changed a little bit. I thought he made like 150K, but he makes 300K a year. So, it\u2019s like yeah. I guess I can, I wouldn\u2019t say that it particularly means something to me, but it sort of, it, it underlines with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">very, very concrete terms the fact that I\u2019m, I\u2019m sort of like invulnerable in a kind of, in a, in terms of that scaffolding. Like, I, you know, I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t get down and out if I wanted to. Like, I\u2019ve had so many chances I think. I\u2019ve, you know, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve dismissed incredible opportunities <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E32\">and, you know, if I didn\u2019t have the scaffolding he provided, I would be someplace very different. Very, very different. But, by the same token, it has sort of prevented me, I think, I don\u2019t know how valid this is, but it has prevented me from, from owning anything. Actually owning or have that experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right. Right. Right. Right. Like, you can depend on them means that, that you\u2019re never independent of them in a certain way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah and like I, I\u2019ve never asked for much, but it\u2019s still true, that, you know, I stayed home for quite a while and at least am able to, you know, he\u2019ll toss, you know, probably like three thousand or four thousand dollars my way at odd moments when it was really crucial. And, you know, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">somebody else would, would have to scramble under those circumstances. I remember particularly in the and I guess we\u2019re out of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099704\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Again, what are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Well, I, I remember last September I had the option of signing a lease or I would have to figure out something to do on the lease I had. I had some money stored up, but the lease is like a year commitment and I didn\u2019t have a job so it\u2019s, it\u2019s something I had to think about. And, I think I needed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">I needed money in that situation. Like, maybe I didn\u2019t have something saved up. I remember working frantically on my business. Getting it in to working shape. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">And, also, during that time my mother wanted, she said, she was really pissed off when I first said that I\u2019m kind of in trouble and then she said alright, I\u2019m willing to help you, but, you know, I have to meet the landlord and I have to talk to him which would be hugely embarrassing because the landlord <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">is one year older than me and it just seemed that, that was what was motivating me actually to work. It\u2019s just that I was not going to face down that situation. I was going to get money together to avoid that embarrassment. And, well, what happened was I think my dad just, just threw a check my way <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED2\">and after that, I just stopped working. I just, I mean you could get through like, I don\u2019t know, it was like a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars. So, it\u2019s like problem solved and he made my mother back down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: But, the benefit is that it removed that kind of sense that you were going to initiate something yourself for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: In one minute, the threat and then one minute the response to the threat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Alright.
