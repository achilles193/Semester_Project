(laughs) I sucked it up and drove. Thank goodness Cheshire Public Works are on the ball with the plows and the salt. (sighs) I\u2019m no later than I usually am so . . . (both laugh) I am sorry about that, by the way. I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">am trying to work on the punctuality. My boss sat me down for a Jesus conversation about my tardiness last week. He said he really needs me to be in the office no later than 10:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Do you get out of here early enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: This is fine. He\u2019s flexible about actual appointments. It\u2019s like when I don\u2019t have anything there is no reason except my inability to [get out the door.] (ph?) Typically, when I leave here, if it\u2019s not weather like this, I get to work around 10:10, which is fine.  Yesterday my boss told us not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">to bother coming to the office today, to just work from home. I treat myself to breakfast and then go home. I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: (sighs) Have I told you about my friend, Yvonne and her shitty ex-husband, Christopher?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: A bit \u2013 I mean, not in a while. They both have abuse histories, maybe, and he\u2019s been really horrible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes. And, of course, he\u2019s accusing her of being abusive. She finally got a lawyer. I\u2019ve been pushing her to do that for two months now, but it was to the point where he refused to give her the passwords to their joint banking and savings accounts. I was like, \u201cYou need a lawyer. I will give <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">you the money for the retainer. You can pay me back whenever, but you need a lawyer. This is not okay.\u201d  And she was like, \u201cBut, but Christopher promised to love and honor and cherish me.\u201d I said, \u201cYvonne . . .\u201d Around Thanksgiving she asked me if we could schedule a regular weekly hangout because she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">and Christopher both are very introverted and have a great deal of social anxiety. I suspect Yvonne \u2013 she goes by Leila online as a pseudonym and I kind of use both names interchangeably \u2013has PTSD, although I\u2019m not a psychiatrist and can\u2019t diagnose that. She has very few friends and she\u2019s not comfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">talking about any of this stuff with anyone except me. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s at the point now where I start dreading our schedule hang-out time a day and a half to two days before we\u2019re schedule to hang out. And then when we\u2019re actually hanging out, it\u2019s just her crying on my shoulder about things Christopher <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">has done that are shitty for like three hours; and that sucks and it\u2019s really exhausting. Then I come home and I am completely miserable and, also, super anxious about my own relationship because, from the outside looking in, Christopher looked solid and happy right up until all of a sudden I was hearing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200195\">all of this stuff from Yvonne about how it wasn\u2019t. Then I asked Dave, \u201cIs there anything you\u2019re not telling me? Is there anything you\u2019re unhappy about?\u201d Like let us talk about our relationship which, I bet, you can imagine how much Dave enjoys that. It\u2019s just \u2013 ugh.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I don\u2019t want to hang out with her anymore because it\u2019s depressing, but I also feel like that makes me a shitty human being because A) she has no one else and B) what kind of friend disappears as soon as things get rough? (pause) And, of course, further complicating this, Christopher\u2019s shrink is my friend, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">Matilda. I\u2019ve mentioned that before. So I hear all kinds of distorted, third-hand things Matilda said that don\u2019t sound like Matilda at all, although I\u2019ve never interacted with her in a professional capacity.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562170\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I see. You mean that comes from Matilda to Christopher to Yvonne to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yes. And Matilda\u2019s partner, Lo is one of the people I would normally talk to about these feelings, but I feel like that\u2019s a little bit awkward.  Lo has been my best friend since we were like 18.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: For some reason I forgot that Matilda was Lo\u2019s partner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: They are, in fact, going to be having a child together. (pause) So, yeah, I can\u2019t talk to Lo about any of this. I\u2019ve tried to talk to Dave about it, but he\u2019s never been fond of Yvonne and he\u2019s always hated Christopher so his advice is \u201cjust cut her out of your life\u201d because he doesn\u2019t see the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">things about the friendship that are valuable to me.  His first priority is protecting me, not doing the right thing by this person who is more or less a stranger to him. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay, this isn\u2019t really the point, but I guess as sort of an aside, I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t, unless she said she didn\u2019t want you to, talk to Lo.  I mean if her partner is seeing one of the people involved in treatment, that shouldn\u2019t, unless it makes it so difficult for her and she says <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve certainly talked to Lo a little bit about how exhaustive it is to spend time with Yvonne and her hell child. Her five-year-old is remarkably, poorly disciplined and I understand the reasons for that. Yvonne and Christopher\u2019s parents were both abusive on the authoritarian end of the scale, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">so they have erred in the direction of being way too fucking permissive with their child; but the kid is just horrible to be around. A big part of my distress around the situation is hearing things about Matilda that do not square with what I know about her and just not being able to cope with the cognitive <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">dissonance.  Not the cognitive dissonance so much \u2013 that was a poor choice of words \u2013 but the steady stream of things about Matilda that . . . Yvonne is misdirecting a great deal of her anger towards Matilda, which I think is totally unfair. I think Christopher kind of deserves her anger. I recognize <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200273\">that this is 100% irrational and unfair of me, but there is a part of me that wants to say, \u201cWhy is Matilda treating this person who is clearly a horrible human being and needs to be sent to Siberia or something?\u201d which I realize is completely irrational and unfair. Even people I don\u2019t like deserve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200274\">to have adequate medical care, et cetera, and that would be a totally inappropriate thing to express anywhere else outside of here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see. I certainly take your point about how part of what you want to be talking about is how upsetting it is to hear these things, supposedly from Matilda, that Lo would not be the one to talk to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: (sighs) (pause) My social circle is ridiculously tiny and incestuous, interconnected in ways that are sometimes ridiculous \u2013 like this. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal. Are all social networks tightly connected with rich overlaps, or are my friends pathological or is it because of living in Cheshire? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\"> I had no models for this growing up because my parents had no friends at all. So I don\u2019t know what normal, healthy social friends\u2019 groups look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562170\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I think the part about having the therapist connected into the social network is unusual. I don\u2019t think anybody has done anything wrong necessarily, but that part seems unusual.  I guess it\u2019s hard for me to tell. Certainly your stuff at work sounds a bit insular, but it seems like it\u2019s probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">living in Cheshire, partly being in touch with people who you went to school with and are friends with people you went to school with in Cheshire. It\u2019s not just having gone to school here in state, but the way that industry is connected to what people are studying; there is that. And it\u2019s also some, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">I guess, where it\u2019s the interests that holds some of this together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: And the polyamory makes everything feel tighter than it would be if we only had friendships connecting us as opposed to romantic relationships. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Also I would think that I don\u2019t know how big the poly community around is, but I would guess it\u2019s small enough that being in a city like Providence, knowing that people often want to be with people who are somewhat like them in some way, like the [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:36) community is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">to be a pretty small, but somewhat insular community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: I know Lo from MIT and Lo met Matilda via Lo\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Alex, who was then roommates with Matilda. They both went to Bryn Mawr.  Lila is Matilda\u2019s wife. Lucy and Fern have a crush on Matilda\u2019s cousin, so that branch of my social circle, at least, only Lo comes from Harvard, unlike other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">overlapping friends\u2019 groups I have where we all went to Harvard. I have a big chunk of friends I know from Harvard; a big chunk of friends I know from my fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega. Obviously, there is overlap between Harvard and APO, but I also know brothers from [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:32) Academy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">and WPI and IPI who live in Providence now. Another big chunk of my friends comes from church. Then there are connections I would not have expected. Someone I know from church knows Thomas through the folk dancing and folk singing community. (pause)  I heard something that I totally unexpected when <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200333\">I realized that Lucas from church knows Thomas. That\u2019s a little bit disconcerting. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">Would it be reasonable for me to suggest to Yvonne that she arrange for a babysitter and I will pay for the babysitter; and then go out instead of hanging out in her apartment that she hasn\u2019t cleaned in six months with her kid, who is shrieking and loud and annoying? (pause) The last time I was over <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">at her place, there was literally nowhere to sit because there was trash everywhere, like piles of paper and dirty food and dirty diapers on the floor. The kid is five and she still uses diapers? Yeah. There were Legos on the couch and then another chair had more kids\u2019 toys.  I tried to move some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">the Legos that were on the couch and the kid started screaming at me not to touch her things. Yvonne told me that she just sits on the Legos, so I sat on Legos for two hours. (pause) I think hanging out with Yvonne would be a lot easier if we weren\u2019t in an environment that is stressful on its own to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200353\">be in. Maybe I\u2019m more sensitive to this than the average person, but being in messy environments is really upsetting for me. It makes me actively unhappy. (pause)  I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just being unreasonable or if I need to just suck it up and deal with it, or if it is actually okay to say, \u201cLet\u2019s go <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200354\">hang out somewhere else.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562170\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: The other thing I\u2019m struck by is how . . . (long pause)  You seem to feel like if you\u2019re other than perfectly accommodating to Yvonne, then you\u2019re horrible. Actually, I think it even goes further than that. I think if you have a wish to be other than perfectly accommodating to Yvonne, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">kind of already makes you horrible.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like in some very deep way, your job is to be completely in tune with what she needs, I guess because she\u2019s having a hard time and is probably someone who really needs you \u2013 something like that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: This is kind of reminding me of Thomas, what you just said \u2013 how I spent a lot of time trying to be perfectly accommodating to his needs or his space \u2013 and what I thought of in my head as his introvert level that cannot be breached. I felt like it was unreasonable of me to ask for things to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">be different. That was completely unsustainable and I ended up breaking up with him. It was not satisfying at all to me. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m also struck by the parallel with your parents. They had no friends, either. This has all left you with a sense that you kind of don\u2019t know where the hell the reality is \u2013 what\u2019s reasonable; what other people would do. It\u2019s like the world of the other person is so encompassing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">that you forget.  I might be wrong about this \u2013 it\u2019s probably some of both. I don\u2019t mean to be critical or anything, but I guess what I have in mind is it could be that you sort of neurotically forget, like there is something for you about this feeling of being kind of sucked into this thing with Yvonne, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F2\">where you sort of lose touch with what is reasonable, although you might know at another time. And then another possibility is that you did grow up with so much of this from your parents and from other people that you just really don\u2019t know in the first place, regardless of the situation. And the reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F3\">I say I suspect it\u2019s at least a little bit of the former is because I don\u2019t think you would hesitate to tell one of your friends if they were in this situation and asked you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Or I think you would be able to predict what Dave would say, even if he liked Yvonne or another friend who was more in control of the situation.  So I\u2019m not disagreeing about you having grown up in a bubble. I think you did and I think that is a problem, but I think there is also this other <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">thing going on where, when you\u2019re in it \u2013 I think this is probably some of what you struggled with with Thomas, getting a little bit enough of an outside point of view on it. (pause)  Maybe this explains a lot. We know that you all too often feel like you\u2019re a really horrible person and have done things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">in a really horrible way. I wonder if that mostly happens when there is somebody you feel sort of in a bubble with in this way, who you have this sense wants or needs something from you that you can\u2019t deliver. Like at work, there is this quality of they expect this of me; they want this of me; here <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200433\">is ideally what they need me to do . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562170\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was just thinking of work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: And any perspective on how hard it is or what else is going on or what else you might need to do or anything, what other people are doing, kind of gets lost. It\u2019s sort of like you can\u2019t accommodate or meet whatever the demand is. It\u2019s kind of ipso facto; you\u2019re terrible. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: I keep connecting this to my parents, but I also feel like I have issues because with my parents, it\u2019s entirely too facile and possibly [clich\u00e9d] (ph?) and also I should get over my parents. It\u2019s been 15 years since I moved out of my house. It\u2019s time to move on.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I wonder if another reason it\u2019s hard to think about stuff with your parents in this light is because, at some level, that\u2019s probably what they want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: What I\u2019m thinking about now is how my parents would withhold affection when I performed anything less than what was expected of me. If my report card didn\u2019t have all A plusses, they wouldn\u2019t give me hugs goodnight. They told me they were mad at me and they didn\u2019t want to talk to me \u2013 go to bed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">without a hug. Or if I didn\u2019t win a competition. I feel like I don\u2019t actually know. I\u2019ve never actually seen this, but my instincts say a normal parent would console their child for not winning; whereas my parents just made fun of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Actually, you\u2019re in the right direction, but I think you\u2019re not even all the way there there. Another parent would have given \u2013 and you probably did or the competitions you remember \u2013 would probably say that you did a fantastic job. Not just \u201cwe\u2019re consoling you because you didn\u2019t win the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">State competition.\u201d It would be like, \u201cOh, my God. Good for you. You worked hard. You did really well. You were in the top eliminator.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: I won second in the State. My mom\u2019s reaction was that second place was the first loser. Then dad made up a sing-song chant to make fun of me in the car ride.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: I remember it. Most parents, if their kid was really upset about not winning, would console them. A kid wouldn\u2019t necessarily be upset and they would celebrate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: That happened in high school, too, except in a national competition, Science Olympiad, which, among my peers at Harvard, Science Olympiad was like the dumb-kid\u2019s sport. Smart kids went and did other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:56) MIT. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: I realize my peer group is not representative. In high school, at least, Science Olympiad was kind of the center of my universe. It\u2019s broken up into events, kind of like a track and field meet; so you\u2019ll have a team of 20 people, each of whom will compete in anywhere from three to seven events. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">I took (laughs) silver medal in every event I competed in at the national tournament.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: That was like the second?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes. It was the same person I was competing against who beat me in every single one. I still remember his name. It was Kirk. He was from Oregon. We competed against each other in Nationals every year for three years and [hated] (ph?) each other. Anyway, Kirk from Troy gold-medaled in all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">my events. He ended up going to Stanford.  My coach was pissed at me for not winning. In fact, at our end of the year banquet, where the team captains gave mock awards to everyone, my friend, Neal, got the pyromaniac award because he had set the most accidental fires in the chem lab. I got biggest loser <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">as my award because second place is the first loser. I don\u2019t know. At the time, I kind of internalized that message, but in hindsight, why the fuck did the coaches and parents let people get away with being that cruel?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562170\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: And it wasn\u2019t just me. The awards everyone got were needlessly, viciously cruel. (sighs) But my parents told me they were disappointed in me. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: There is a part of me that wants to say, \u201cOkay, now that I\u2019ve pinpointed where this comes from, I can turn off this emotional reaction because I\u2019ve figured it out. I should stop feeling like I\u2019m a terrible person for not living up to unreasonable expectations. I know where it comes from because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">my parents\u2019 expectations were unreasonable and they reinforced this with tough loving and training, withholding affection. Now that solves the problem. Move onto the next one.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Right. My sense, when you say that, is clearly no, it doesn\u2019t work that way. But pointing out that in another iteration of it, I think we\u2019re talking about once it feels like there is sort of that expectation for how you\u2019re supposed to be \u2013 however that outrageous \u2013 you\u2019re supposed to meet <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">it.  I think there, in a subtle way it seems to me \u2013 and you may disagree \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit my expectation. Not exactly, but maybe it\u2019s more like it\u2019s in the air in a way. What you\u2019re saying is according to a model of how therapy works. When you pinpoint the source of the emotional problem and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B2\">understand the context that way, then you are supposed to be able to move beyond it and get to the n next thing. Thus proceedeth therapy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: You have explained to me multiple times that\u2019s not how it works; and I guess cognitively I can accept that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Sure, but this is one of the durable qualities in your relationship with your parents, which are clearly impervious to the reality \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, but it doesn\u2019t work that way or that I have sort of articulated. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Have you heard the joke about the mathematician, the physicist and the engineer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Which one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: A physicist, an engineer and a mathematician are in a hotel at a conference or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: There is the one about the sheet and the one about the fire?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: This is the fire one. The physicist calculates the heat transfer of the fire, trying to predict the exact amount of water necessary to put out the fire and burns to death. The engineer overestimates her safety margin, gets a bucket of water, puts out the fire, and was fine. The mathematician <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">looks at the fire and says, \u201cThis is a previously-solved problem,\u201d and goes back to sleep. (both chuckle) I used the phrase \u201cpreviously-solved problem\u201d earlier and it reminded me of that. [It is a way of gently mocking myself; just because you know the solution to a problem doesn\u2019t mean that there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200792\">not still work to implement it.

I am aware that it will not make them different than they are. It certainly won\u2019t change the way they are, but I suspect your impulse to do that relates to how it would put you in touch with how upset you are and how much you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">missed out on because of how they were; and that\u2019s very real, I think.
