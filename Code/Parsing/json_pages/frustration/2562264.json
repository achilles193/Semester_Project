Hey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I think things are going to get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Good, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I feel rested this morning, which is a change from the past couple of weeks, and I\u2019m sort of eating more normally, which is good. I sort of feel like when I\u2019m depressed I like, food tastes a little bit different. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense, but I think I don\u2019t, it\u2019s hard for me to eat <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">at mealtimes, but then I just really want lots of like desserts, basically, or something like carbs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So I\u2019m sort of doing, what\u2019s, that\u2019s sort of always how I eat. I\u2019m getting sort of back of the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Well good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been reading the, there\u2019s been like a couple of articles recently about Woody Allen since, so like his adopted daughter wrote a piece for The New York Times like, \u201cYeah, no, actually he really did molest me when I was seven, like that was a real thing. I wasn\u2019t lying about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">that.\u201d And then there\u2019s like a push back on her, and then some people pointing out, like hey guys, it\u2019s a lot more common for children to be sexually molested than it is for them to lie about it, so maybe we should, you know, rather than pursuing that he is innocent, maybe we should presume that she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">is innocent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So I was sort of reading that and getting a little disgusted by the whole situation, and then a friend linked to like a 1979 article by Joan Didion in The New Yorker where she reviews like Manhattan and Annie Hall and one other that I haven\u2019t seen. I hadn\u2019t seen either of those since I was like fifteen, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">so I don\u2019t even remember them very well. Oh man, Joan Didion is a great writer. Like she\u2019s just, just like takes him to pieces. Yeah, just like really. I mean, she\u2019s just sees them all as fairly narcissistic movies. And I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s sort of hard for me to assess because I haven\u2019t seen the movies <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">for a long time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">She, she also talks about, or she, one of the things that she like brings into it is like the extent to which people in the movies and Woody Allen at the time like talk about therapy as this like central practice of their life, so she\u2019s like, you know, Woody Allen discussing his own analysis after twenty-two <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">years, it\u2019s like holy shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I would say that\u2019s pretty long analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: That\u2019s good to hear. It feels long to me, but you know,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s pretty long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">It\u2019s like today clear for me, how this work in like immediate crises, and then it\u2019s taking me a long time to get comfortable talking to you when I\u2019m not in an immediate crisis. So <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I hope you got home okay yesterday in the snow. It was like the best kind of snow. It snowed all day and there was like an inch on the ground, and it wasn\u2019t very cold. It was perfect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I still don\u2019t have a, I still haven\u2019t gotten a physical planner which I still need to do because I don\u2019t, Google Calendar doesn\u2019t actually like, I just never check it. I put things on there like once a month, and then I never, I can\u2019t remember to look at it, but anyway, I went through it and put all <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">my stuff for the next couple of months on Google Calendar, whatever good that will do. James is editing, and so he <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562264\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Like a manuscript that he\u2019s considering?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s editing his thesis, and his, I made a joke when he was talking about how like finding a reference to confirm like one footnote had taken him all day and I made a joke like, \u201cYou should just let it go, nobody\u2019s going to see it,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo one will notice it.\u201d He really didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">think it was funny, like really didn\u2019t. So that might take another six months or so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">He asked for help like coming up with the right word yesterday and we spent like ten or fifteen minutes trying to think of the right word. The problem is it\u2019s like a, it\u2019s like two molecules are interspersed in kind of like an A-B-A-B pattern like this. But like interspersed sounds like sort of random <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">when it\u2019s actually quite precise, and so the word he wanted was like synchistic (sp), like the opposite of chiastic, but he was like, \u201cScience is not going to know what that means.\u201d So I eventually came down on the side of, \u201cWell, if there\u2019s an English word that\u2019s the precise word that\u2019s used, use it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">and they\u2019ll look it up, or they won\u2019t look it up, and won\u2019t know what it means, but like use it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: So you would have to dumb it down for the scientists?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Well, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. I mean, it\u2019s not dumbing it down, it\u2019s just like different specialty, specialized lexicon. But I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">It\u2019s ongoing. So there was an article in the Washington Post yesterday, it was like an expose for the vestry of my church, just bought, decided to buy a rectory for the new rector. And they ended up buying this like, spending like $3.6 million on a condo in Denver. And so the Post was like, \u201cWell, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">know, maybe this is a lot of money to be spending on a rectory.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">And you know, a dwelling place for a church, like an expose article. And like I have sort of mixed feelings. The reason, the sensible reason for buying a rectory was that like, say I wanted to be able to walk to church, which I think makes sense, but like A, the other four full-time priests all live <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">in Denver, and they drive to church. And they also have really good parking spaces. They get to park like literally on a street right next to the church, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: And they can park there whenever, so like they can come down at night and like, I told Brett, that was better than a rectory. But so they all live far away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">B, like the church is in Denver. It\u2019s walkable, but it\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s a longer walk than other places. And like, do you really need this, like a two-car garage, like is that really the thing that you want? But, but like I don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t bother me in the way that it like really bothers some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">people. I\u2019m more just like, \u201cThat\u2019s silly.\u201d The thing that I thought was especially silly was like John\u2019s quote in the article was like, \u201cNo, this is a comfortable place, but it\u2019s not an opulent place.\u201d I\u2019m like, John, you have no idea what those words mean, do you? I\u2019m like just, just don\u2019t talk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">So that\u2019s my rector. No idea that he\u2019s really rich, like yeah. I felt like everyone from Cavalry that they interviewed about, for the article like said like really wise things, or you know, good things. And some people were saying like, \u201cNo, these were the reasons that it was a good choice.\u201d And some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">people were saying like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the choice I would have made,\u201d except for John. Like John\u2019s the one who sort of put his foot in his mouth, at least from my perspective. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562264\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(Long pause) I guess I\u2019m sort of shaken up by, if I think about it too hard, I mean, who doesn\u2019t want to think about it too hard? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">I don\u2019t know. I mean, it feels like I never get to forget how vulnerable I am. Or like when I feel, it feels like when I do forget that, then you know, that vulnerability sort of makes itself known in scary ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: In a way I feel like it would be kind of nice not to be her this morning in that, like it might help you feel like a little more distant from how bad you\u2019ve been feeling, or you\u2019re here to think about it, can feel a little imposing or hard to know what to say, you said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I mean, it\u2019s hard to know what to say, but I\u2019m not sure that, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so, like I don\u2019t\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean that you like feel unbalanced, don\u2019t want to be here, I don\u2019t mean like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: So I guess like, what I\u2019m mostly worried about sort of applies to you, but also applies to James and like, I guess it\u2019s just you and James, but that like where I\u2019m anxious is in feeling like I need to, I feel like if I just come in and sort of like chatty and normal that like that will somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">make like the last week not count. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">Or like it will like make it not have been real, and, but so like I don\u2019t know that that fear, feeling like I need to present some continuity all the time is like that sort of there was. In some ways like that\u2019s there with everybody that I talk to. But you and James are sort of the people that I talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">to about anything like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">(Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine the feeling was like I wouldn\u2019t believe you and you wouldn\u2019t be credible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes, yeah. But I mean, it\u2019s just like I feel like I always worry that you know, I feel like I just switch so abruptly between like the weeks of being or I don\u2019t <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I mean, there\u2019s like, I worry about being credible, but I also worry about like scaring you or hurting you, like that. You know, I\u2019m worried about being discontinuous. I don\u2019t, do you know, like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, one way one day and another way the next?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: With no very clear rhyme or reason, and that I would, I would be like thrown off by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know, I worry about it more mostly for James. Yeah, I think I work much harder to sort of present a continuous front to him, but I feel like it\u2019s been more important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">I guess with you I worry about you seeing me as a crazy person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Well there is that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, because obviously you couldn\u2019t handle that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I mean like with people in my life who have been sort of wildly inconsistent in this way. So like my mom, actually there are a lot of people in my life that was like my mom, my dad, healthy in some ways, like my ex-boyfriend, like the\u2014 I never know what to expect, I never knew what to expect, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">never could like trust that things would be the way that I needed them to be with them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562264\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">And yeah, it scares me to be that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I, on the phone the worry for me is, maybe it\u2019s really more for James. I bet he\u2019d be overwhelmed by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Not knowing what he was going to get, or if he was going to get\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I sort of, I feel like the inevitable consequence of that is like you drive people away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">They can\u2019t trust you, yeah. It may interest you that be consistent or be who he needed you to be in the moment. Yeah, I feel like most of the time I sort of make a narrative for myself where my mood like goes up and down and it\u2019s still like one person doing all of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">And that\u2019s sort of breaking down. It feels like no, it\u2019s just all over the place in several different places at once, and so that sort of freaked me out, and now I\u2019m thinking about it a lot. Not actually thinking about a lot until now, but like it\u2019s there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">(Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well I\u2019m tentative about this, but one like alternative view to that is actually that the trajectory of your ups and downs often make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: You just sounded so tentative saying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure what it was that has sort of pulled you out of, or at least away, somewhat away from what you\u2019ve been feeling the last few weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">I think really, over the last couple of days it seemed like you were starting to feel better yesterday morning and then are continuing that trend today, maybe moreso. It seems to me you do seem to me to have found a way, both on the phone I think on Sunday, and yesterday here. I\u2019m not sure, but I kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">of suspect a little bit withdrawal as well, I don\u2019t know, to like articulate a bit more what things were like in a way that\u2019s, you talk about hard to do, and you often, I think, feel stymied at. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">I\u2019m not sure. But that may be part of something, anyway, that helped. And, but there\u2019s like also something else going on with your inclination to feel like you really just like the people in your family, the fact that especially your mom, probably. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s about being crazy. I mean, like being inconsistent about organization or being angry can be often sound like your dad where it kind of inconsistent about sort of being crazy, sounds more like, has to feel like more with you and your mom. Anyway yeah, it\u2019s like there\u2019s something. It sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">of makes sense to me that it would seem like more plausible to you in a way because it wasn\u2019t because something that happened that I\u2019m feeling better or an interaction. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m just being crazy like my mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t, so it\u2019s, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think like that\u2019s the move I\u2019m trying to make. I think it\u2019s more like, I think it\u2019s less that I think there\u2019s no reason behind it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">And more that I am worried that you and James will think that there\u2019s no reason behind it. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: And that, I don\u2019t know. I mean, it also like, it doesn\u2019t just feel like things are on an upward trend. Like it feels like it\u2019s just gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: And like it stopped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">Which makes me, which is sort of a little bit less comfortable for me than if I move, sort of get out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Because it\u2019s like whoa, now you see it, now you don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562264\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, but I feel like, but I feel like in talking to you about it, I don\u2019t want to sound like, no, I just feel better, it\u2019s gone. Like I don\u2019t want to say that so I sort of present it as like, I think things are a little better. I think that, you know, like I think this is coming, like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">coming up out of it, as opposed to like, no, I\u2019m just fine now. So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: So are you saying partly that you feel kind of ashamed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it that way, but yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: That, I mean, that I (inaudible at ) is a bit mysterious, and as you imagine to me, is not necessarily all that credible. It\u2019s gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Like a magic trick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And if you, another thought that came to my mind is like you know, if you\u2019re a kid who\u2019s having trouble in school, either academic, I guess, or behaviorally or whatever and then just comes home and tells the parent, oh actually, everything\u2019s fine now. The teacher said it was fine, I brought <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">all my work in, I\u2019ve been, you know, behaving well in class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">Everything\u2019s cool. Or I guess an addict would be another person. It\u2019s like yeah, I know I was drinking, I had this problem, I was, you know, really torn up and struggling and I couldn\u2019t stop, but now it\u2019s fine, actually. I mean, it sounds like you feel that\u2019s how you\u2019re coming across.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, on one hand like I don\u2019t trust that. Like I don\u2019t, it feels like it\u2019s just gone, but I don\u2019t actually believe that that\u2019s the case until like, but I also worry that like if I spend too much time being like where did it go, then it will just come back, and yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: It seems to me there\u2019s also a subtle split in it that, I don\u2019t know, somehow seems important where before we kind of stop and say wait a minute and say let\u2019s talk and look at it, I think you own more of the well that\u2019s just how it is, and you give me more of the oh my gosh, Dr. Lee (sp), <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">isn\u2019t going to believe or is going to think I\u2019m crazy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">Whereas when we sort of stop and talk more closely about it, you\u2019re like well, I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me, and I don\u2019t really know if I believe it, but I\u2019m saying that I don\u2019t need to act there, so do you know what I mean? In this sort of subtle way, it had been feeling more <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">like I was going to be critical and you were just sort of talking about how it is, whereas now it seems to me you\u2019re sort of owning a little more of both of those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">How I\u2019m, I\u2019m really anxious right now and I don\u2019t exactly know why, but I\u2019m like, my entire body is tensed up. That\u2019s interesting. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Do you know if it\u2019s, if it, when it hit you? Was it after what I just said or was it like when you started to explain to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, when I started like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see. Like how actually it\u2019s gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Maybe that made you feel kind of exposed, like you were telling in a way what seems like the less reasonable version of the story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think I just don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to react. I think I am anxious that like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">That I will make you feel like I didn\u2019t actually need your help in the last week, but like I don\u2019t know. Yeah. Like that wasn\u2019t real. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562264\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I guess you feel in some way like maybe you played a trick on me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, something like that. But it\u2019s also like I was really, really scared and I don\u2019t really want you to tell me that there wasn\u2019t any reason for that. So, but like it was foolish of me to be so scared. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I guess those are a quality of undoing to it, where there\u2019s a way that feels like you\u2019re, it feels to you like you\u2019re undoing (inaudible at ). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: In a sense it sounds like partly your, partly mine kind of revised version of what happened where you\u2019re tricking me and I\u2019m not going to believe it, and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">It sort of makes me think of when you see T (sp), actually. Like you know, a couple of people that I told about these things are like boy, you, so you\u2019re missing a lot of memories, but then they\u2019re bad memories, right? So it\u2019s fine for them to be gone. I\u2019m like, it\u2019s really not over at all, like even <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">if I don\u2019t, even if I don\u2019t remember like even if I don\u2019t like have that, the aftermath is still real, like the, so yeah. Sort of, I\u2019m not really sure how precise the analogy is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">Like I feel like there\u2019s some way in which like I don\u2019t want to get erased.

And even if it wasn\u2019t quite clear how, I think, if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">I guess so like, you know, so you want to push a button and erase all of your memories of what a horrible breakup with somebody was like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Like (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: I have, and I\u2019ve heard of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: It was a good movie.
