So when I was interviewing for jobs three years ago now; academic jobs, you know, it was a story. I mean I probably sent out ten resumes total of which maybe five were viable, in the sense that, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">they weren\u2019t done in the end, two minutes before I\u2019d hit the deadline, and so on. [0:00:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">Out of those, I ended up getting three conference interviews and two campus interviews. So I was feeling very \u2013 at this moment, I went on the student campus interviews; I was feeling very good and very helpful. So the Ohio State interview went very well, then I had another at Northwestern immediately afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">It was weird, I mean it\u2019s a great job in a sense that it\u2019s like it\u2019s in this kind of rural area just beyond the Chicago metropolitan area, so it\u2019s like an hour or hour and a half into the city. It\u2019s a pretty conservative school for a liberal arts school. And the history department was really weird; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">like, I don\u2019t know. It seemed like some of the people were very energetic and some of the people were really deadwood. [0:02:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">But you know, the talk went very well, and yet, it was some very weird vibe in the air. And I talked to the guy who\u2019s probably most energetic and successful as on PBS all the time; does American history. He said, while we were having our kind of one-on-on, which I had with all the members of the department; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">something like, \u201cYeah, you know, I wouldn\u2019t count on this one, because people are threatened by you.\u201d I can\u2019t remember exactly; he put it almost as boldly as that in his terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, whatever,\u201d you know. And I guess I was struck by it; I\u2019m like what the f*** am I going to do? I gave a very good talk, and was very game, and said what I thought were all of the right things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [overlapping conversation at 0:03:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: You know, and like somebody took me to the library and showed me Northwestern\u2019s sword, which is kept in this vault in the library, and I\u2019m like \u201cWhat the f*** am I supposed to do?\u201d But I smiled, and they snapped a picture and sent it to me by e-mail. I never \u2013 okay, well I\u2019ll tell that (Aurora) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">(ph) after it\u2019s over; after the rest of the story\u2019s over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">In any case, we went out to dinner with a couple of faculty, and I remember, we went out to lunch and then we went out to dinner. And there was one guy who ran the French program, and he tried to speak to me in French. I remembered thinking, this is really stupid, you know. I mean I can speak restaurant <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">French; I read very well in French. But what is this about? And I just answered him in English. I thought that was a little weird. [0:04:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Then at dinner, I told a story, which is kind of a meaningful story to me, that related to (pause) (sigh), to what I think the responsibility of academics is, you know, if you\u2019re going to be in a state of some repose, to keep these kinds of things in mind. Anyway, the story is that, when I went to Switzerland <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">to do my dissertation field work for the first time, after which I abandoned it for, you know, about eight years, more or less. No, I abandoned it for four years and then I abandoned it again for another four years.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562344\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">I was in the courtyard of a mosques, and I was going up to the prime ministerial archives. Yeah, I wanted to look nice, and my shoes were pretty scuffed, so you know, there\u2019re a lot of shoeshine people in that area; it\u2019s right on the edge of the marketplace. [0:05:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">So I went to one of them, and there\u2019s this really really nice guy. And we just started talking, and it was fun to talk in Arabic; he was really sweet. He was just a very; he had a kind of Arab sweetness about him. And I think I said something like at one point that I was studying for my doctorate; I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">here to study for my doctorate. He suddenly got very serious, and he was just kind of excited and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a doctor?\u201d And he pulls up his sleeves, and because he works with all these dyes and things, he had like sores and tumors on his arm. He\u2019s like, \u201cCan you do anything about this?\u201d I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">\u201cNo I\u2019m not that kind of doctor.\u201d Suddenly, he felt like s***. Like of the people that I\u2019m telling this story to, it\u2019s just, you know, like a meaningful story, is like, \u201cOh, well that\u2019s depressing.\u201d [0:06:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">After dinner, this same person who I take it was the principle individual who was kind of threatened by it, because he asked it in an aggressive question. I said, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Or something; I wasn\u2019t going to see him again. And he said, \u201cNo, no, you won\u2019t. That\u2019s it.\u201d Ah? Apart <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">from being very obnoxious, you know, I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it for the rest of the dinner, he was very like \u2013 and I assumed, because I was a reentry student, because this, you know, more or less responsible position in the international arena, they would probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">be leery of whether or not I was a flight risk. I think their previous year\u2019s candidate had left after a year, so they didn\u2019t want to go through the whole search, just to have somebody take off. [0:07:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">But I remember thinking to myself, wow; did I disclose something that shouldn\u2019t have disclosed? Did I say something was inappropriate that reflected a lack of commitment? You know, like whatever; I mean there\u2019re a million things that are probably was and could have been that led this rather obnoxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">character to kind of to this interjection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">But I remembered thinking at the moment and certainly afterwards, when they hired some 20-something woman, who I guess was less threatening, you know who they felt like they would have more control over or something. Or whose work they liked better. I remembered thinking, \u201cGod, I really just have no <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">idea how to conform. I\u2019m just saying the wrong thing. I\u2019m saying things that show a lack of commitment, and maybe it\u2019s true. [0:08:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">And I guess I thought at that moment, as I was walking up here, because you know, I mean that\u2019s sort of the topic at hand at the moment; anyway. So that was the one, just the take home from \u2013 oh, the (Aurora) (ph) that popped in my head at the last moment was, I never submitted for reimbursement from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">them. You know, I bought my ticket, and they\u2019re supposed to pick up the tab, and I never wrote them for it. I\u2019m not totally sure why, but that\u2019s something that I often do when I feel very unresolved; I\u2019ve done that a lot, probably have in priniciple, thousands of dollars coming to me that I just never <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">submitted for reimbursement. [0:09:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562344\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">Another interesting random association here, reminds me of a paper that I got accepted for this conference, and actually bought a ticket for, that I wasn\u2019t going to be reimbursed for, but to a professional conference. I actually, potentially got a fairly interesting one. But I ended up not going to; <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">I just called them, and I said, I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m not totally sure why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: [Could it have something about the conflict] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well it was nothing, I mean, you know, it was like I was giving the version of my dissertation about let\u2019s see, it would have been, yeah, just six months after I\u2019d (inaudible at 0:10:10); just the summer after. (pause) (sigh) So yeah, so like on the one hand, thinking about this, we have \u2013 we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">sort of assembling little (inaudible at 0:10:31); you know, one was from the library; one was between us. And here\u2019s the third thing yet; and this vignette -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: I have a question -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: about the story, about the \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t sort of fully understand your reaction and feeling about what happened with the shoeshine guy, that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: I mean, I felt bad; I felt sad; I felt like I didn\u2019t have what he needed. Moreover, I was responsible at some, you know, kind of microscopic level, for \u2013 I\u2019m assuming that his occupation, it was an occupational hazard that he was engaged in. I\u2019m guessing that the, you know, its regulation of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">shoeshine materials, and Switzerland is probably less stringent than in the U.S., if that, who knows? And you know, clearly, the fact that he was covered in ink, and dye and paint, was not (even) (ph) related to the fact that he was suffering these terrible skin eruptions. [0:11:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Right, I followed that. But you said that it related to your feeling about the role of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well, just think about when you take this course, occupational course, this would be my ideological rationalization of my feeling, which was likely more complex, and maybe the ambivalence was more pronounced in my previous rendition of it. But you have responsibility to do something useful and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">productive with it. You know, it\u2019s not, basically the lesson of the story for me is that you are privileged in a way that relatively few people are. I turned out, and it wasn\u2019t privileged. (chuckle) [0:12:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">If one takes this course, then one is privileged, and it\u2019s potentially a very wonderful thing to do that can really lead to good in the world; you can\u2019t just do it, and you know, live high on the hog, and go to conferences on your research project, and feel like, well you know, I\u2019m doing my bit [at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">the price of] (ph) \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I guess to me what it says was that there are things to do in the world, and there\u2019s suffering, and there\u2019s responsibility to, if you benefit from shoeshines, to in some way; whatever the way that you have chosen is, to do something that alleviates the suffering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a pretty unexceptionable point; maybe this person didn\u2019t quite get it; maybe I didn\u2019t express it in the way that I would have wanted to. Maybe this person was threatened, as what\u2019s his name said. [0:13:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Whatever. I mean at this point, it\u2019s not sweet 16; you know, it doesn\u2019t matter. But yeah. I guess though, this story for me, in the context of our ongoing conversation here, give a little bit more specificity to the ambivalence. There\u2019s a lot of texture there, that\u2019s a bit abstract, in the telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">of the other two moments; the two vignettes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562344\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">And I do feel very deeply ambivalent, but I also felt very ambivalent, I mean I guess the curiosity \u2013 the question in my mind is, to what extent this very laudable sentiment, I believe a very laudable sentiment, is true; and to what extent it\u2019s something a little bit different, which it\u2019s just a discomfort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">with, you know, the whole idea, being in an institution. [0:15:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I follow it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: You know, is it just a rationalization? I think one of the things that I wondered, or doubted or have doubted, with some evidence at my disposal, I have to kind of \u2013 is whether this is really just a way of justifying to myself, the deep deep discomfort, or unfitness, or you know, maladaptation <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">that I feel when confronting, imagining, conceiving, executing the process of being in an office; being in a job; being in a regular environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">You know, there\u2019s another moment that came into my mind in this connection, that\u2019s completely different. But every \u2013 so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: I want to talk about those moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Sure. [0:16:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: I think, (pause) I think in a way, they\u2019re both moments of self-(ordinate) (ph) and betrayal again. But they -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: You mean both the shoeshine, and the college and the interview?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right, sorry. I meant the shoeshine and the college, where, you know, (pause) probably why they\u2019re pretty evident, right? (coughing) You felt or had a sense that this guy had these hopes that you could help him, and then you couldn\u2019t, and that sort of related to your commitment, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">sense of commitment that like, okay, yeah I\u2019ve got to do something with this opportunity to (inaudible at 0:16:57) this people. And not, as you say, just sort of like live high on the hog and do my own thing until I get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">But whether or not you work as an outback (particular) (ph) shoeshine guy, that there\u2019s some sense of not turning and walking off on the society or whatever that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I mean it\u2019s opportunity. And I think similarly, when you\u2019re at college, that you know, \u201cWhat the f***, you were too good?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d I mean I know in your sort of world of like academic hiring and promotion, that\u2019s probably not the most unusual thing to ever happen <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">at all. But still, like from another point of view, the total set-up, presumably, the idea is to go and do as good a job as you can, and be impressive as possible. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: One would think. [0:18:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) When they\u2019re nagging you for that, and then be dicks about it, that\u2019s seems, you know, you don\u2019t think of a (trailer) (ph) really quite on like a set-up or really unfair. So anyway, I\u2019m just struck at the way that that is, and clearly, is in your mind in thinking about how patient <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">\u2013 go ahead, you had thought of another moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, and another kind of thought, (matching) (ph) yours. Another moment \u2013 every night and every morning, I take Grayson around the apartment. And I pick him up, you know, preferably at 6:30 or 7, but more like 5:30-6. And, you know, sometimes it\u2019s dark and sometimes it\u2019s light. So if it\u2019s dark, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">I turn on all the lights and I go through the apartment. I start on the street, and we say good morning to the things; good morning to all the things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562344\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">We go and we say good morning street, and good morning avenue, and good morning to the house across the street, [to the couch] (ph); all the things in the house; we go from to back. And at night, we do it over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">For me, this is a very, this feels very important in our (inaudible at 0:19:41), you know, there\u2019s this one thing; one kind of structural complaint that is hammered home to me again, and again and again, it\u2019s that routines are very difficult for me. And you know, I have a specific grievance that I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">been working through at the cost of some effort over the last few years with my parents for not just like starting that sense of regularity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">So whatever, but God knows what the impact of something that happens to you when you\u2019re five months old, but that\u2019s the significance of it. And I remember like a couple of days ago, maybe Tuesday morning, picking Grayson up from the crib; being really really tired, as you know, it\u2019s almost -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:20:43).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah exactly. And just like not feeling like doing it, and having this familiar feeling of the (key) (ph) intervening in a routine. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, f***, I\u2019m just too tired to do this.\u201d Again, shocking, right? But it was like the routine was exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s not picking (threads), what is he now, 18 lb. organism out of the crib, and walking from one end of our apartment to the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Once you\u2019re up -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Once you\u2019re up, it\u2019s not like that would be much more taxing than whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: But somehow, [overlapping conversation at 0:21:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: But somehow, it was like \u2013 yeah. Yeah, and I guess at the moment \u2013 at the time, I made a connection to this sense of comfort or discomfort, actually in the event, with institution \u2013 institutional relationships that seems intriguing to me, that I wondered about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">There\u2019s like this something that intervenes, that did not actually intervene at that moment, because in fact that I followed through, it wasn\u2019t enough to \u2013 but you know, it\u2019s been enough to, for example, interfere in my running regimen; it\u2019s been an (inaudible at 0:22:17). So that was the kind of random <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">associational thought that I had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">But the specific kind of thought that I had in relation to your comment was, you know, there was another kind of betrayal that I think when you described was I guess, in some ways, my betrayal of the shoeshine guy; I don\u2019t know, it wasn\u2019t like we had an agreement that I violated, but there was a kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">of betrayal going in the other direction at that moment of, you know, the vocation that I\u2019d chosen; I betrayed I guess both of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">In other words, I\u2019m pursuing a doctorate and I can\u2019t doctor.

If you think of this quasi-biblical scene of going across; taking the ferry across the river, walking up <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">the hill in nice shoes, and a pair of khakis, and getting a shoeshine, and discovering that my shoeshine is killing somebody.

So I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know what to make of any of that. But that seems like a betrayal so to speak, that was probably equal, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">at least of equal significance in all of the junk that we\u2019re talking about; the betrayal of my vocation, and my subsequent betrayal of my vocation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: My vocation betraying me and me betraying my vocation.

I said \u2013 she said, \u201cOh my parents and the house is a mess.\u201d And I knew that it would take like an hour and a half to clean up. But, you know, and I responded and that was the text that came in. Whether or not you remembered, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">there was a text that came in when I was here, and I had to shut off my phone; that was Jennie, like this long, long text, and I could tell that she was getting stressed out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">So I wrote back and I said, \u201cListen, you know, I\u2019m going to get a cup of coffee after I\u2019m done.\u201d I came back 45 minutes later, and there was traffic, one was a broken-down train. It was a broken-down train, but it wasn\u2019t the train I was on, so I don\u2019t know, it just actually delayed me. (inaudible at 0:28:19).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">Anyway, so I got home and she just kind of jumped at my face. And it was all this and that, you know, \u201cEhhhhh.\u201d And I said, \u201cWait a minute, is this about me looking for a job?\u201d She said, \u201cYes.\u201d (chuckle) She went off on that for a little while. I got mad, and that\u2019s the point we stopped. I said, \u201cOkay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">this isn\u2019t getting us anywhere.\u201d Later that evening, she apologized, which was appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">But I think I said to you in February or whenever, you know, weeks and weeks ago, if I don\u2019t get on top of this, then all of this other stuff is going to be really difficult. And indeed, that has been the case. Indeed, somehow, despite my appreciation of this fact, I (chuckle) still \u2013 I still \u2013 I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">still no further. And this somehow, despite this interaction, which I get yet again, confirms, you know, what I knew to be the case, and it\u2019s evident impact on my partner; my person I love who on one hand is mad, and on the other hand, is feeling very stressed out. I\u2019m still no further.

But I feel, it\u2019s just weird; I feel as I describe it, and on the one hand, I wonder whether at this point, my saying this is weird, is not some kind of weird rationalization <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">or way of fending off the, you know, just to say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s inexplicable; it\u2019s ineffable.\u201d But, what?

I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t quite fathom it, and yet, on the other side of the coin, you know, everything we\u2019ve been talking about for the last half hour is clearly wrapped up in it at some degree. And yet, I feel very tangled up. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">(coughing) [0:30:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562344\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">I guess what I\u2019m saying is, on the one hand, there are two contrary impulses that are occurring to me simultaneously, on the one hand, a feel a strong sense of certainty that, you know, this stuff that I\u2019m relating is very important to what\u2019s going on with this right down here. And on the other hand, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">I feel a strong sense of skepticism about whether it\u2019s necessary to go into all of this, that and the other thing, rather than just simply to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">In other words, am I just using my faculty for narrative, which you know, is a blessing and a curse, and as we\u2019ve discovered at length, to fend off something that I feel stressed out about doing. (pause) I almost feel (sigh) I had this impulse, or fantasy rather, and my fantasy is, I say, \u201cMarshall, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">this is it; we\u2019ve come as far as we can go. Thank you very much and good-bye.\u201d And I go, and I do it and live happily ever after. [0:32:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">The only way that the fantasy is, and this is a very classic fantasy for me, that the only possible way to get it done, is to close the door on something; to reject it; to say good-bye. And that somehow, I guess you know, conversely, or by implication, staying here and continuing to talk about it is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">at this point impeding my ability to actually take this step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">This is a very common construction for me. So you know, I\u2019m not sure how seriously I\u2019m proposing this, but it\u2019s very clear in my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Right.

(pause) Another (pause) this might not be all there, but part of the way there \u2013 but another way I can think about the stories that told before, because the [time we had been <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB1\">talking about them] (ph), is that like there\u2019s impedance in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">Like this guy\u2019s got this problem, and he in a way, like the very emotionally immediate for both of you puts it on you, and says, \u201cPlease, can you help me with this?\u201d And of course you can\u2019t, and there\u2019s no way you could. I think, among the other things, you felt sort of an emotional level then was kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">of impotent (ph) to help him. [0:35:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Like that\u2019s why you felt that, because you know, even though rationally, you know that like of course you can\u2019t have that, I mean on that level. But on some level, like you\u2019re totally bad for this guy, and here he was like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well, (from) (ph) the response, I mean I\u2019d just gotten a shoeshine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: You know. That was certainly one of the things I felt was that. Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and then with the interview too, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: Nothing I could do. I mean maybe I could have been [overlapping conversation at 0:36:30] Well, and God knows what [overlapping conversation at 0:36:34]. You know, I did my best and maybe I didn\u2019t play it right, and maybe I should have answered in French, my terrible American accent, (chuckle) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">you know, whatever. Actually, maybe there was a better way to play the game, but it wasn\u2019t like I just blew it. I didn\u2019t blow off the talk; I gave him very good talk; I was engaged with people, and you know. So yeah. [0:37:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">Impedance is a very strong and a specific metaphor.

So if I am helping you, somehow that\u2019s getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">in the way, and you need leave. [0:38:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: In order to be able to [that\u2019s too] (ph) what you need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: So I did something that I regret there, and that I had completely, I mean you know, like all\u2019s fair in here, and you\u2019re big enough to take it. But just in a kind of interactive sense, you know, that was a hard thing to say to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">CLIENT: And it completely did not occur to me, you know, that side of it completely did not occur to me. In other words, the impact of what I said on the other person in our relationship, did not occur to me at that moment. But yes, I guess that is an implication, that the very thing that you do, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">like a recapitulation of the shoeshine guy; the very thing that you\u2019re doing, if that formulation fantasy, as I think I called it, (chuckle) is correct, is actually, I mean impeding me. Although, I feel the need to protect (chuckle) you somehow. [0:39:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s very interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: I mean, yeah. What I was saying was, that we had reached a point \u2013was that we had reached a point where having explored all of these things in order to proceed to do the thing that we\u2019re talking about, I have to leave, which is not the same thing as saying that intrinsically, by its very nature, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D11\">our interaction\u2019s impeding me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">And that seems highly significant, and is much I think, much more in line with how my fantasy was running. And with my general thinking about it. You know, at some point, it will be the case that we\u2019ll get a point where if the narrative exploration, or the exploration of the narrative is not as productive <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D31\">as just haphazardal action, and where I feel competent to engage in that action, and I will say good-bye. [0:40:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">CLIENT: But I do, yeah, I do feel a little bit and I do feel a little bit of, like my immediate reaction when said that, was remorse. I\u2019m not sure about the metaphor still, but my immediate reaction was remorse; it was like, well, I didn\u2019t really mean that way; I didn\u2019t mean it as anything about you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D71\">I was just thinking of myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">CLIENT: So what is about that that feels a sense important to you?

(pause) Maybe it\u2019s like the concern about hurting you or making me feel the way you so often and so unfortunately have felt. I don\u2019t mean by that, that I think you\u2019re trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD1\">to just selfishly be remorseful, I mean to say that like, that\u2019s a feeling you know all too well, and are imagining I think in me in feeling \u2013 [0:42:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: Well I told you, you know, you\u2019re the third therapist, the me therapist.
