She\u2019s so cute. It doesn\u2019t matter. She just makes me laugh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry. A scheduling thing. So you\u2019re out Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m likely to get a cancellation at 12:45 on Wednesday. Do you want it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: No. Let\u2019s just start again on Monday. This weekend is ridiculous and stupid with the conference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: The conference. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: But I think I\u2019ll be too stressed to get away in the middle of the day. Anyway, and then I get a text from my roommate that says, can I have some of your wine. And I was like, sure, I have a bottle of white in the fridge or a bottle of red in the cabinet if you want. You\u2019re welcome to open either <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">of them and have some. Like really, I don\u2019t care. They\u2019re free from work. I get them all the time. Okay, fine. And she writes back, okay. I was like, I\u2019ll be home. You know, I\u2019m at babysitting so I\u2019ll be home at whatever. [1:18] She was okay, I might have a guy over. I\u2019m okay, fine. So then I get home <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">and she drank the entire bottle of wine and was like, ah, and dropping pizza on the floor. And I was like, cool. This is exactly what I wanted to come home to. Whatever. I was just oh, that\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And then she\u2019s like, so I invited this guy over I don\u2019t really know. And I was like, do you \u2013 have you gone out with him before? She\u2019s like, nope. From the Internet. And I was like, okay. And then he comes over and I was like, do you need me to leave? She says, no, no. And so I\u2019m okay, maybe she just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">\u2013 and it\u2019s 11:00. (inaudible at 2:06) He brings some pretzels and a bottle of Wild Turkey. Blech. Then it got really uncomfortable, because I was sitting there and I noticed that he was rubbing her thigh. And I was like, okay. Something is weird here. I didn\u2019t understand. So I went in my room, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">he I guess stayed over. I wake up in the morning to the sound of her having sex which is completely inappropriate in my book. I don\u2019t care what you do. You have a roommate. You have to be respectful. You have to put on music or keep it quiet or do whatever I do when I don\u2019t disturb you. Or maybe I do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">and now I know. Whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter. It was not pleasant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And I was like, ew. And the idea that he was some guy she just met on the Internet made the whole thing even more \u2013 I slept with the \u2013 I put the cats in the room and locked the door. Because I don\u2019t know what the fuck. She doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s there to murder us or rob us. I don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">And then, he was there until like 12:00. So hadn\u2019t come out of my room, because I was, no, I don\u2019t feel comfortable. I wanted to walk around in my bathrobe and do what I normally do in my house. Oh, and she had the nerve to knock at my door and ask for more fucking Advil. I was like, you haven\u2019t bought <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">Advil yet since the last time you asked me for Advil? I gave it to her and slammed the door in her face. And also, she smelled like alcohol. It was just in my face. And I was like, this is gross. So I was unhappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I ended up not seeing her because she went into more sleep more after he left or whatever. Oh, no, I know what happened next. After he had left, the guest or whatever, I was in the living room and I had every single light turned on. My laptop. A book open in front of me. Papers everywhere. Couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">have been more apparent that I was clearly knee-deep in school work. She comes in and is about to sit down. She\u2019s like, would it bother you if I watch TV? I was like, yeah, actually it would. I have a shitload of work. Use your fucking brain. You were just in here all night last night getting drunk. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">I\u2019m here with shit out in front of me. [4:25] So then I didn\u2019t address anything else with her. I just looked at her and was straight-up, no. I have a lot of work. She was like, oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">Then I managed \u2013 Oh, then in anger wrote a note to her before I left that said, Helen\u2013 and I taped it on the TV. It said, one, bring all of my dishes out of your room and wash them well, please. Underlined. Two, take out the bin. Three, sweep floor. Four, clean out microwave which had been stinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">for weeks because of an explosion disgusting food that she warmed on high. So then I\u2019m out with Stephanie. Then I don\u2019t see her when I get home. Then I leave in the morning before she\u2019s up because I went to my mother\u2019s house to do laundry. And she texts me and says, hey, is it cool if I finish the mopping <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">\u2013 postpone the floor. I\u2019ve got to go to my parents, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [5:22] And then I didn\u2019t respond at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">And then this morning, because I was so pissed about whatever. And this morning basically wrote her an e-mail where I was like, telling her, if I\u2019m mistaken and you somehow knew this guy, forgive me. But it seemed from what you told me you didn\u2019t know him. It was very uncomfortable for me that he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">in our house overnight. I can\u2019t have that. And then started talking about how basically that she \u2013 what\u2019s the point of even telling me she\u2019s going to postpone it. It could have been done in the time that she sent me the text message. Who cares? Either do it or don\u2019t. Like, don\u2019t ask my permission. If <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">I was cool with you postponing it, I wouldn\u2019t have fucking written you a passive-aggressive note about it in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">So then she responds basically by saying, okay, well he isn\u2019t somebody random. He\u2019s part of an online community that I\u2019ve been part of for years. And I\u2019m like, okay, but it still sounds weird. And, you know, but we\u2019d never met in person. But it\u2019s still weird, because you still invited him over for a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">weird, disgusting stranger booty call. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m still judging you and it\u2019s still making me uncomfortable. I mean, yes, it does make me feel a little better that she had some sort of a history with this guy. [6:38] But still, it\u2019s still weirded me out. Then she went back and apologized. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">she\u2019s like, I completely understand why you got upset about that and why you were feeling this way about that. I should have explained things better. But she was fucking shit-faced, soAnd that she also talked to me because she feels like she\u2019s always walking on eggshells. So whatever. We\u2019ll end up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">talking tonight. I still need her as a roommate. Maybe we can ease some of the tension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">But it\u2019s definitely colored my weekend and made it unpleasant. Because I was just stewing. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll talk. Whatever. And I am fully aware that I can be difficult to live with sometimes in terms of when I am stressed and frustrated or whatever. And I understand what she\u2019s saying. [7:32] This is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">the conversation I\u2019ve had with my mother before. The whole walking on eggshells thing and not being able to say anything and being nervous because I\u2019m so angry and da, da, da, da, da. So that\u2019s completely valid for her to want to talk to me about. I have no problem discussing it. I mean, I think one <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">of the issuesOh, and the thing that I said, you know. \u2018Cause I said something like I think you misrepresented yourself a little bit when we first were going to be roommates. I had no idea that your room would be like that. I had no ideaI couldn\u2019t\u2019 have anticipated that I would have had to wake up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">to you being carried home or strange men in the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">And then she made itTo be fair, my room is my business. If I\u2019m fine living like that, that\u2019s my business. But you are absolutely right about the dishes in there. You told me very specifically before we moved in together that this is something that bothered you with your last roommate and I dropped <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">the ball, so I\u2019m sorry. So fine. [8:30] So we\u2019ll talk and whatever. But myI started off the morningOh, and then, I was supposed to maybe have tentative dinner plans with Sergio last night. And then he wasn\u2019t texting back, wasn\u2019t texting back. And then his phone\u2019s off. And then it was off the whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">night. Of course, then it turned into worry. Like oh, what happened? Did he die? \u2018Cause that\u2019s what I do. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a Jewish thing or a woman thing or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">But my conclusion, if I don\u2019t hear from you all day and it\u2019s really unlike you, you\u2019re probably dead. That\u2019s just where I go. And then I started to feel upset about that, because I was like well, it\u2019s not like I could call one of his siblings and say hey, what\u2019s up. I can\u2019t reach your brother, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">nobody knows I exist. Nobody knows we date. He\u2019s very secretive. And we\u2019ve had this conversation before. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t just date. And he said, because I\u2019m very secretive. I\u2019m very private. It\u2019s probably because he has a wife. Whatever. But then I got all upset about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Wait. What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: It\u2019s probably because he has a secret life. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not even Facebook friends with him. But that\u2019s my theory. [9:41] Why aren\u2019t we just dating? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s the big secret. Who cares? But anyway, then it started to make me feel sad and upset that I don\u2019t have any kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">of relationship and somebody that I actually have feelings for and care about and am worried that that they\u2019re dead, because they\u2019re not answering their phone. I can\u2019t really even care about. I can\u2019t really even act upon. I know his brother and his sister. And I very easily could have-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Did you guys go to high school? How did you know him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: No. I meet him through. So he was a rebound guy that I didn\u2019t tell you about for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: And I know his sister and brother, because they\u2019re all friends with this girl, Sadie and her husband Emery, who I met through Franklin (ph) but then who stayed friends with me after Franklin and I broke up. [10:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Is that how you met him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s how I met Sergio. Through these \u2013 with all these people or whatever. So I\u2019m Facebook friends with both. We were Facebook friends, but then after a fight one time he unfriended me and said we\u2019re done with Facebook. Whatever. I don\u2019t trust you anyway. So who cares? So normally, I probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">would have just been like, hey, Maddox, what\u2019s up? Because he would like, who cares. But then I felt like I couldn\u2019t or that it would just be out of nowhere or that it would be like, Sergio, you\u2019re seeing Trina? What\u2019s going on? And then he\u2019s be like, why\u2019d you-? You know. If he wasn\u2019t dead. Which apparently <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">he wasn\u2019t. So then I get dressed and I leave the house, and I\u2019m starting to kind of spiral a little bit even though I started to try to start the day positive. I\u2019m in the week before my period is supposed to come, so I\u2019m kind of on edge about that, just because I don\u2019tbecause of last month.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: You never got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Right. [11:24] And I\u2019m walking out of my house and he\u2019s pulling up in front of my house. And he\u2019s like, I came becauseHe\u2019s like, Trina. And I\u2019m like, what the hell happened to you? I thought you were dead. That was literally my response. He\u2019s like, my phone is broken. I don\u2019t have a phone. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">So I was coming to write you a note and leave it for you, because I figured you already went to work. I was like, well I guess you\u2019re lucky you caught me then. He\u2019s like, yeah, I know. And I was like, I even wrote you a Facebook message and we\u2019re not even friends on Facebook. He\u2019s like, I\u2019m never on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">Facebook. I don\u2019t check it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">I was like what are you talking about? I see you like photos and shit because I\u2019m friends with some of the people you\u2019re friends with. You don\u2019t have to lie to me. It\u2019s okay. You can just say whatever. Who cares? It was like, you don\u2019t have to be oh, I\u2019m never on Facebook. Well, what did you want from <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">me. I didn\u2019t have Internet yesterday. And then after I stared thinking I was like, you have a tablet. Plenty of other people you know have phones that you could have gone on and been like, can I message Trina. Even if you don\u2019t know my number by heart. You can find me on Facebook. There\u2019s plenty of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">other things. Or you could have showed up yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty thin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s ridiculous. He could have shown up on Sunday at any time. I as home all day. He could have written me a note. By the way, I know we had tentative plans for tonight. Why at 8:30 in the morning? Was it because he was on his way to work? Was it because it was just, oops, I forgot about Trina? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">Was it that he was at some other woman\u2019s house that was close by and thought oh, I may as well stop? He\u2019s like, well, that\u2019s why I was coming to write you a note. I was like, I thought you were dead. Good luck with your phone. Have a nice day. Why schlep all the way to my fucking house? He doesn\u2019t live <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">that close to me. He lives in Waltham, close to my old house. I mean, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">It\u2019s all very thin and stupid. And then of course, he showed me his phone that\u2019s all smashed up and retarded. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t really care. That\u2019s not the point. Plus, you could have gone on any form ofAnd then, I see that, because on Facebook now there\u2019s this stupid function where you can see when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">somebody has seen your message. It says, seen at whatever. So I saw that he saw my message at 9:17. He had pulled in front of my house at 8:30. So how did you not have Internet the whole day on Sunday, but then a half hour after I see you, you\u2019re able to check it. [13:34] Then he messages me at 1:00 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F2\">p.m. and is like, just seeing this now. Something really impersonal. Like, I don\u2019t ever go on here except to like pictures. I was like, what the fuck does that even mean? So you\u2019re just being a creep? Like, you\u2019re Franklin? And nice seeing you. Hope you\u2019re having a good day. Nice seeing you? You came to my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">I don\u2019t understand. And it\u2019s just \u2013 Anyway, then that\u2019s a whole other issue why I am continuing to see him or talk to him even. When clearly, he doesn\u2019t give a shit about me. But then I\u2019m like, well, you did come to my house. Then it\u2019s even still, why did he come to my house? I\u2019m like, why didn\u2019t you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">come yesterday? [14:26] Am I supposed to be like, oh okay, good. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. (pause) And I had wanted to kind of start the week off by feeling good and \u2013 I mean, I was also disappointed because I was really looking forward to going out with him on Sunday for dinner and stuff. Especially after <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">this stupid experience with the guy last week and that didn\u2019t\u2019 pan out and with the stuff with my roommate and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">I was looking forward to going out with somebody I know that I\u2019ll have a nice time with and will pay for me. And you know, who I have a connection with and who I have feelings for and who I think has feelings for meal little bit. So that was a disappointment in and of itself and then just to find out <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">it was simply that his phone was broken and he couldn\u2019t figure out a way to get in touch with me was really a disappointment. [15:22] I was hoping he was dead or something. Because his excuse sucked. There\u2019s so many \u2013 he owns a tablet. What, nobody he knows has a computer in his house? He lives with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200532\">both siblings. Nobody else has a phone? He knows his brother has my number, because I told him his brother\u2019s texted me before. He knows his sister has my number, because we\u2019ve hung out before. It\u2019s just \u2013 Oh, but then they would have known, so God forbid. Oh, I never go on Facebook, so I couldn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200533\">messaged you on Facebook. What? You still have a Facebook account, right? You still go on and like things, because I see you do it, right? I\u2019m not fucking stupid. And he knows my history with Franklin. He knows exactly what happened. And I\u2019ve had this conversation with him before. And he says, don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200534\">turn me into Franklin. I\u2019m not Franklin. And I\u2019m like, okay, then don\u2019t fucking act like him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">And then, so what happened was I got to work and I had to do a bunch of printouts. And they didn\u2019t staple and I opened a door while it was printing and a big jam happened. And I had an absolute nervous breakdown. I was crying and I couldn\u2019t stop crying. [16:40] And I was sobbing. And it just felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">I couldn\u2019t control myself. And I don\u2019t want to be breaking down because of a fucking machine not working. I don\u2019t want that to be happening at work anymore and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and it still is. And so I \u2013 maybe I need to go voluntarily commit myself. I don\u2019t understand how I can\u2019t even come <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200552\">to work and not have a breakdown about the fucking machine not collating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">And then she got all worried and she was like, well, you need to call your therapist right now. Da, da, da, da, da. I was like, well, I\u2019m seeing him later. She\u2019s like, no. And I didn\u2019t call you, because I didn\u2019t feel like I was at risk. I didn\u2019t feel like I wanted to hurt myself or die or anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">I just was feeling kind of numb. Just a waste of space and a waste of life. And also, really out of control of my emotions and reactions. And then Stephanie was like, I think you need to talk to your prescribing doctor and Josh between maybe something\u2019s not working with the medication. [17:56] And that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200572\">made me upset all over again.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">Because then it\u2019s like, cool. Every time shit sucks I just change the meds. Awesome. Which is not what I wanted. And then I also had the bright idea of not doing the 20 milligrams the five days before my period, because I was afraid that it messed it up. And then, Stephanie\u2019s like, no, you\u2019re stupid. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">You should. And maybe she\u2019s right, because now I\u2019m getting all overly whatever. And maybe it\u2019s hormonal, because I\u2019m close to my period supposedly or whatever. (pause) I\u2019m just feeling out of control again. [18:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I imagine maybe you also didn\u2019t call me because it felt like more of a risk than you wanted to take. I mean, your roommate is totally letting you down. Sergio is totally letting you down. The fucking printer fucking totally let you down. And you\u2019re feeling really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: No actually, exactly what I said to Stephanie was no, he\u2019s not going to call me back, because he\u2019s got patients all day and I\u2019m seeing him at 4:30 anyway, so I\u2019ll probably just see him and wait to talk to him at 4:30. And then, she was like, no, Trina. If you\u2019re feeling like you need to commit <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">yourself, then he\u2019ll call you back. If that\u2019s really how you\u2019re feeling, then you need to talk to him and you need to call. But yeah, that\u2019s exactly what it was. But I didn\u2019t want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And I think the thing that\u2019s in there is that if you called me and I didn\u2019t get back to you, you\u2019d have been really hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: Exactly. [19:49] And then Devon (sp) came in and saw that I was all upset or Betty (sp) had gone in and told her whatever. It\u2019s her first day back after being away last week. And she\u2019s like, do you want to go home? Like, what\u2019s going on? Of course I wanted to go home, but I also couldn\u2019t because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">I had so much work and I was meeting somebody for one of the conferences. I don\u2019t want this to be happening anymore. And it\u2019s still happening. I don\u2019t know what to do about it. And sure, it is valid to talk to \u2013 I\u2019m actually meeting with (inaudible at 20:33) next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">And you know, it\u2019s valid to talk about maybe I should change it. Maybe this is not the right one. Maybe we haven\u2019tBut at the same time, that\u2019s upsetting, because I didn\u2019t want to take more and I didn\u2019t want to change it and go through all these trials and stuff. I don\u2019t want to be on medication. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">just don\u2019t want to feel like this. (crying) I mean, every time there\u2019s a problem, I don\u2019t want to feel like, oh, well, I\u2019d better go see the prescribing doctor. [21:07] (pause) And it\u2019s so unfair that Franklin gets to be doing whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re saying \u2013 I was actually \u2013 I guess I\u2019m thinking about something that happens here sort of with the printer. Yes, it\u2019s true that the printer let you down, but I think there\u2019s more specificity to it. It also occurs to me that you\u2019re upset now. So where most of the time you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">been pretty pissed. I can see why with what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t get that. But I also think that there\u2019s a way that \u2013 There\u2019s something about you coming in here on a day when like, a few hours ago when you were feeling so upset and so much at loose ends kind of spending a bunch <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">of the time so far I think more than disappointment and frustration and pissed off.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">I think that that\u2019s something that you don\u2019t want to be feeling, but it\u2019s safer. And it also kind of gunks things up, I suspect. I don\u2019t mean for me, but I mean for you. It kind of gets in the way. It gets in the way of your being able to talk about things that you\u2019re feeling really frightened about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200671\">and really at loose ends over. Like what happened earlier today, I think. And I don\u2019t think you do that for no reason. I think it\u2019s because yeah, I think you\u2019re really worried about having done it or risked it. But I think it is very you to in a way trust me with that. Anticipating that I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200672\">let you down or am I letting you down. I\u2019m not sure how much that\u2019s I\u2019m not going to have a way of handling it so it won\u2019t happen again and that would be the disappointment. Or whether I sort of won\u2019t get or somehow it won\u2019t sink in with me how really out of control you\u2019re feeling and were feeling earlier? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200673\">I guess how helpless and how panicky and overwhelmed. [25:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get it. (pause) I\u2019m just not sure that you\u2019ll be able to help me. I just don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I don\u2019t know what to talk about that will be helpful. So I just am \u2013 It does get all messed up and I regurgitate how I was feeling or whatever and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">not \u2013 I don\u2019t feel like I ever make any progress. The same thing could happen with the printer tomorrow and I could have another breakdown about it. [26:40] And I think also I have these little moments where I feel I\u2019m in crisis. And then I\u2019m able to calm down or move on just because I have to be at <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200692\">work and work. And then, it\u2019s like, oh well, maybe I was just making a big deal out of nothing for myself. And maybe it\u2019s not that bad or that I\u2019m fine. Or, oh, I\u2019m just being a baby or not having enough perspective about what\u2019s really upsetting in life or the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: No, you\u2019re pretty upset about some stuff. No, there\u2019s stuff going on. I\u2019m not saying that I understand what\u2019s behind it, and I get that maybe you feel that you\u2019re just overreacting or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m justMy go-to is to be that this is my fault. I\u2019m making a big deal out of something or I\u2019m turning this into something to be upset about or it\u2019s my fault that I feel like this in the first place, even, choosing to surround myself with people that make me unhappy or are not right to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">But it\u2019s my fault. [28:00] Even when they are right to me because I\u2019m whatever. Being angry at Helen (sp) or I\u2019m not understanding or asking enough questions or I\u2019m not-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That certainly does sound like you to feel really at the end of the day that you\u2019re responsible for whatever\u2019s happening. I mean, you might get mad at her for a while, but you picked her as a roommate, so really it\u2019s on you. Obviously, I\u2019m not saying I think it works that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20071\">CLIENT: No. But I feel that way. (pause) And I don\u2019t want to feel like every time I\u2019m having a harder time again that I\u2019m just going to change my medication. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">THERAPIST: Sure. I\u2019d imagine that feeling there is tantamount to saying it\u2019s just your fault. [29:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">CLIENT: Well, you can\u2019t fix it, so here\u2019s some more pills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s certainly not on anybody else, and the only thing that you can do about it. So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: I felt like I was really going nuts this morning with this fucking printer. Why the fuck and I getting so upset about this fucking printer right now? But I couldn\u2019t help it. I was so upset. Well, why can\u2019t anything work out for me was all I could think. Why does everything have to get fucked <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200791\">up for me? I can\u2019t \u2013 I click staple, and it fucking staples. Why does there have to be in a jam in every fucking part of the machine? (pause) [30:09] And why does Stephanie get to be engaged and living a life, and I\u2019m fucking \u2013 I don\u2019t feel like I have any life. (crying) I don\u2019t even know what this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200792\">is. I don\u2019t even feel like I matter. What difference does it make if I\u2019m here or not or lying in bed or committed or whatever. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It really does sound like youIt\u2019s feeling like you don\u2019t matter and all these things really are your fault, and the best you\u2019re going to be able to do is hopefully figure out some way to fix it. And that would prove it\u2019s not your fault. [32:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: It just continues to be really upsetting to me that this is my life right now. And it\u2019s not how I wanted it. And it\u2019s not how I imagined it. It\u2019s not what I planned for. It\u2019s just what I\u2019m fucking stuck with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: This is not at all what you wanted. You want to be with somebody, married and with a kid or two by now. And settling down somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: Right. Instead of fucking depressed as hell, working at a job I\u2019m tired of. Living with somebody that I hate living with and dating guys who don\u2019t give a shit about me. (crying) [33:05] (pause) I mean, other than Stephanie and my mother, not one person reached out to me over the weekend. I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200811\">nobody messages me unless I message them, you know. And that felt shitty. Yesterday I was really feeling shitty about it. I was like, what the fuck? And this is what was going on this morning at work that made me feel like I really needed to not be at work for a couple months or something. And I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200812\">can\u2019t get ahold of myself. [34:19] I don\u2019t want to be fucking crying about the printer. I can\u2019t be breaking down at work about the printer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: I know that in a way that that\u2019s the problem, but that\u2019s not totally the problem. The problem is what you just said the problem was. That your life is totally not what you want it to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that\u2019s why the printer\u2019s making me so upset. That\u2019s why I\u2019m breaking down over stuff, because everything just feels like it sucks. Now I feel like I should take the 20 milligrams this week because of feeling like maybe I am a horrible roommate or maybe it\u2019s not working at all or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200851\">But I\u2019m nervous, too, because maybe it is what fucked up my period and that I\u2019m not going to get it again. And then the whole fucking thing is going to happen again. (crying) (pause) [35:49] And then Stephanie\u2019s point was like, well no, because the last few months your body\u2019s used to getting the 20 <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200852\">milligrams for a week out of the month, it\u2019s probably going to be the opposite effect and fuck up the chemistry more if you stop. And I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562516\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20087\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20089\">CLIENT: I mean, she\u2019s probably right.

[36:55] I mean, I feel way more resentful than upset toward Franklin about that than I do towards Lucas, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200891\">because that was already the plan. But it\u2019s still frustrating after the way that it ended and how he treated me to just-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I know. And then just walk away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just swept to the curb. (pause) [37:44] It just feels really bad to be close to two years into this fucking breakup and I still feel like a total wreck over it. (crying) Still feels like it was fucking yesterday.

I don\u2019t understand why I still feel like this. And I try to fucking take medicine that doesn\u2019t seem to be doing anything really. [40:24] And I try to fucking date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I think that you feel kind of in freefall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">CLIENT: Totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">THERAPIST: And as though nothing\u2019s really slowing you down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">CLIENT: Nothing is really doing anything. That\u2019s what it feels like. Nothing does anything. [41:33] This thing with Helen. Fuck, I should have just not brought it up, because now I\u2019m going to have to work on stuff. Now it\u2019s turning into a conversation where oh, that\u2019s good, because I feel uncomfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200951\">with XYZ, and I want to talk to you about it. Oh, fuck. Great. That\u2019s just what I needed. More stuff to work on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">THERAPIST: It comes back at you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">CLIENT: Right. Everything. That\u2019s what it feels like. Everything I do. I try to open myself up to seriously dating somebody. He comes back to me in the form of an idiot who is really annoying. [42:26] But I even though wow, I have so much to do. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be able to feel sad or upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200991\">or angry. I was actually looking forward to this week in the sense that I\u2019m going to be so busy that I won\u2019t be able to think of anything else.
