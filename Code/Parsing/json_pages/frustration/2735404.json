That s actually, you know, right on it s on West (inaudible at 00:00:38) between Central and Stanford. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: That s convenient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, then like because I guess because, you know, since the agency usually picks a person and sends them. But this time, the agency saw the posting online, and it was like posted to a couple of other temp agencies, so they actually had to interview me, which meant that I actually got to see <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">the space that I d be working in. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: So you already had the interview?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, I had the interview on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay. On Friday; okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And then he had said that they d probably hear back by Wednesday, and then they called me today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: And you were accepted today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And I accepted it. Because if they don t actually know I know the range discussed was like $12-$14 an hour, but I don t know what number was actually settled on, because I couldn t ask that kind of question there. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but the important thing is got a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: For some period of time, in a convenient location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Six months with the possibility or high probability of extension. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Wow, that s pretty long-term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: So in a good location; doing something that s enjoyable, and you re in your area of expertise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: And I don t have to dress up; I wore this suit to the interview, and I wore like used shoes that look good, but are really uncomfortable if you walk on them for some time. Like he showed up in jeans, and a button-down shirt, (chuckle) and I was just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So that s your code?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: That you can wear jeans and nicer shirt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, so after all of that shopping for more professional looking outfits -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well you can put them away for another time, and you need them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: So when do you start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Either the 9th or the 16th; I don t know which.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And you also have some time which is nice, because one on the things you were worried about was your being called in the morning, and having to show up that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: And so having a week of at least a week of prep time to kind of prepare yourself -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: And I have to do drug test, and now I m like starting to worry a little about the fact that I m on Klonopin will be a problem, since it s a controlled substance, even though it s a good controlled substance I have a prescription for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: That you have a prescription for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: That s not what they re looking for most likely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Probably not, but I don t if I have to like, you know, I mean I probably should I don t know if there s a way of like letting them know ahead of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. They usually give you some information about what they re actually looking what they re actually testing for; not all drug tests are the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: So you may be able to, you know, get some information about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, I ve gotten no information other than this drug testing, and the place right near the temp agency that I went through. But yeah, that is all I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well you re not doing anything wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Oh no, I know that I m not doing anything wrong, it s just is this thing that I am doing that is necessary for my psychiatric health something that will set off, and look like I m doing something wrong? (pause) But I just assume it would; I can t be the first person who s like, you know, especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">if people are ADD and on like Concerta, or something like that, which is even more controlled than my Klonopin is. Like it probably it won t be too much of a problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I would doubt it s going to be a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I m a little bit nervous now, but like when I had the interview, so we started off in a room that was nice, and was very obviously not the room I would be working in. But he then gave me a tour of the area and stuff, and so I was fine when I was down, and I didn t panic or anything; <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">it didn t set off any this will be really a depressing scene.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">You know, because then we were being in the same room as a person who is my supervisor and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So you won t be isolated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: I won t be isolated, because the researchers come in every day, except for Friday I guess. And like for an hour a day, they come and give you the notebooks and stuff, so I would be interacting with them too. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">And I d be doing a few different things; it s not just one thing. It is not the situation last time (overlapping voices)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know it sounds like pretty good situation for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I won t have to stop any of the things in my social life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because the commute is so reasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Do you know what your schedule will be like? You know that was another thing that concerned you, sort of fitting in therapy; fitting in your extracurriculars. (overlapping voices)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: I was instructed not to ask them about that while I was interviewing, you know, before I got an offer. But I think so, I know that in theory, you can stay later; like the way he interpreted it was me asking about overtime. It was like, you know, you can do overtime if things are really busy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">but we encourage people to do 40 hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">But that means that I probably could like have either a morning appointment, and stay a few minutes later to make up the time, or something like that. Like I ll have to schedule things in the morning, or afternoon, and I m wondering if between I think with couples therapy and this, I m wondering if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200811\">we could go to every other week, and then I have an appointment a week.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that s certainly a possibility; we ll see how you re doing. I think the biggest thing has to be, you know, that you re okay. And yeah, if going every other week is something that works for your work schedule, and keeps you feeling like you have enough support, (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Have you had another couple therapy session? Did they talk to you after the first?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, we did last Wednesday. And that pretty well we did this like role playing exercise in which well first we discussed (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: (sneeze) Excuse me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: First we had the it was a conversation about the fact that with arguments like or the fact that I give up on James when he maybe can do something, but is saying no I can t. So we were each other, and each of us said the things that like, you know, I said the things that I would want Sydney <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">to ideally say. And Sydney said the things that I would want him to ideally say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">So he came up with if he tells me that he probably can do it, he needs encouragement, then I can give encouragement instead of just expecting me to know and give him encouragement without him telling me that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">But then when we switched back and went to the conversation again, it actually was like, you know, me saying, Okay we need to do something. and then him saying, Will you be mad if I don t? Which I was like, Okay. (chuckle) This is where I would have to either lie or get things (chuckle), or make <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">things worse, because the answer is, Yes, I would be mad if you wouldn t do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: And is that not an okay answer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: That is not an okay answer, but it is also not an okay question. She like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: So that would be a switch if he can hold off questions like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, we came up with the word (round) (ph) of me saying like, Oh, well it s very important to me. Which to me is kind of like gagged, and like not be dragged, and not say what I mean, but apparently that s better for Sydney. But I mean I think it s doable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: It s the truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, it s not untrue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: But it s not sharing exactly what you re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: It s not sharing what I m feeling, and it s also avoiding a direct question. You know, it s like that is a yes or no question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It s not a fair direct question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: As it sounds like the therapist pointed out; that it puts you in a position of either having to lie, or something that you know is going to really upset him. So that s an unfair question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, (pause) it is. (pause) I don t think we ve been able to manage to that replicated in real life. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well this seems like a really useful exercise, to have, because these are things that you ve talked about; being worried about, sort of how you guys talk to one another in an argument, and what s questioning whether or not you re saying things that are fair, unfair, and being able to sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">of role play these things. It seems like a really useful practice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And then the other thing is like over the weekend, we did have a fight over the weekend, which was actually caused by him not being direct in the first place, with like so we went to his reunion at Providence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">And in the next well I guess it s a couple of towns, but like a 20-minute drive away, is this really, really, really, really, really big and well-known yard store that has like all the art ever. And I wanted to go there, but they re not open on Sundays, which would have the day that would have made <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">the sense. And Friday, we got down early enough, but then he wanted to relax in the hotel, because of all the driving, even though I did most of the driving.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">So then I was like, okay, can we do this on Saturday? And what he was thinking is that it wouldn t fit in the schedule, but he wouldn t actually outright tell me that. I m like you d thought I would get mad at him. If we just did a schedule or anything, and we came to the conclusion that it wouldn t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">fit, that would have been fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">But he was getting all mad at me like, Oh, well you only want to go to the yard store, you don t want to do anything else. And I m like, That s not true. The reason we didn t get together with your friends this morning is because you made the decision to sleep in (chuckle). We could have scheduled <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">this. Not my fault. (chuckle) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: How did that fight end?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: In the end, we came to an understanding it was just like it got really heated though, because I just got so mad at him for treating me like I was being unreasonable, and it was all my fault. I m just like those aren t fair accusations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">Even if he didn t directly say it s your fault, he was his words implied that it was my fault. (pause) When I guess it was a miscommunication, but it was caused by his reluctantness (ph) to deal with it directly, even though I wanted to use scheduling to figure it out.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">But (pause) yeah. And plus I actually did sexual things over the weekend, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like that s really been an area of improvement for you guys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. It s just then like that happened on Saturday night, and then last night though we got into a fight. Well I sort of just went crazy for no good reason. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: That sounds judgmental; give me the story of what happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Because I was just feeling sort of bummed out about not knowing whether or not I was going to get the temp job, and having, you know, met all these people who were really successful, and\/or hung out with my friends who are also really successful, and feeling like I was kind of like the failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">Then also I was trying to knit, and the cat was attacking my yarn, and attacking my needles and I couldn t even knit. I was just frustrated with the cat, and I just wanted alone time, but Sydney <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: So you were disappointed in yourself; you felt frustrated. That sounds very different to me than went crazy for no good reason. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Okay, except that I had a way overreaction, and got mad at Sydney for being there, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Well okay. So yeah, you had good reason to feel upset, but you responded more strongly than what feels reasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah; like the fact that it turned into anger, and I don t know why it turned into anger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: So let s look at that. What you know, rather than critiquing yourself, let s look at what happened when what switched? You felt badly in comparison to these people you d been spending time with. You felt frustrated with the cat and not being able to knit. How did it turn into anger that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">got expressed at Sydney?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: Well I just, because I wanted to just like relax, and listen to a song and stuff, but I felt like I couldn t because he was there. And I feel weird watching Internet videos for anything that has sound with him around. I mean there was the obvious solution of using headphones, but it was me resenting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">not having any <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Privacy. Because you know, he gets well now he s going to get all the free time in the world, because I ll be out working all day. But even before that, I had my games, you know, twice a week; I had (pause) I haven t been that good about going to Saints with (inaudible at 00:14:19), but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">ideally I also have swing dancing, and ideally I also have (takia) (ph). So there are these periods in the evening that I have (pause) or he has free time, and I have fun things, but not (overlapping voices)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Right. So this is something you mentioned before, that he s there; he s in your space; he s in your apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: And like, he s okay with theoretically planning alone time and stuff; it s more just like the problem is, I don t really know ahead of time when I m going to need alone time, and I just want to be alone. And if it were at his place, you know, I could always go home. But since we re at my place, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">it s like, that would consist of kicking him out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel like you have kind of an intruder. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, when there s the living room isn t really a place to hang out because it is now completely filled with cat stuff. (pause) So it s really just the bedroom. I mean I guess I could hang out in the bathroom, but that seems -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: But that also seems kind of unfair; this is your apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it would also be unfair to be like, Sydney, you have to go to the bathroom now, and stay in the bathroom and not bother me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: But it doesn t really sound unfair to ask him to be in his apartment sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, but the problem is, I can t do it; like he doesn t want me to do that when I m mad at him. And I don t really realize I want the alone space until I m like mad\/frustrated with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it would feel different, even though you can t predict when you might feel mad or frustrated, if you had time during the week; just had some time apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: To have, you know, to have time to watch whatever videos you want to watch, and not worry about your headphones. Or just really be alone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: In theory, he has his game on Saturday, or on Sundays like every other week. But it just hasn t happened for the past three weeks. And that s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: As long as every other week is not enough, anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: I mean maybe it is; like it s a stretch of a good four hours, plus transport time and stuff. (pause) It d be nicer if it were every week, but people aren t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Nicer for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: Nicer for me. And I think it would be nicer for him too, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but it sounds like this is really a need you have in your relationship to have some space, and to have some privacy tweak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: And I just don t know how to do that, and you know, because sometimes I do want him around, and that s I just don t know how to (pause) set that up, especially with the oncoming me getting a job, and then only having evenings free.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: And you re imagining that if said something like, I need some more sort of alone time during the week. Could we spend (pause) you know, pick a night at your own apartment; at our own places. That that would be something that he d feel really badly about?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: I guess it s just I want alone time, but then don t want to sleep alone. So if it s for the evening, then I m sleeping alone, and I don t want that. Which it s why it s like, why can t he just have a nighttime activity, like I have one, or a daytime activity or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yes, you can t set it up to be exactly what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: It may have to be (pause) some flexibility or compromise. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I m not sure how he d react to sleeping alone. I think he d be okay with it, but I mean I guess if it was just one night a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: What do you dislike about sleeping alone for a night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Well, because sometimes at night, I m feeling bad, and I often will want hugs and stuff, and I can t really get that. I mean I guess I can hug my cat, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: It s not quite the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: It s not quite the same. (pause) But maybe if Sydney weren t around, because originally the cat would sleep on my head, and he decided to start sleeping in the cat bed outside, but maybe if it were just me in the bed, and not Sydney, I could get the cat to sleep on the bed with me, then I wouldn t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201111\">be sleeping alone anymore. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">But that s a little bit harder to work (inaudible at 00:19:04) because a person will sleep in a bed, but a cat will sleep where a cat wants to sleep. So, yeah. (pause) I guess I could do that for one day a week; I just wish he could just get an activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">But he doesn t really like going out at night anyways, because the car accident that he had (pause) several years ago at this point. I m thinking it was like five years ago or something. But it s I guess his anxiety gets worse at night; the car accident is definitely like it (pause) (sigh) results <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201151\">in him never wanting to drive at night, but I think it also extends to not wanting to go out when it s dark out either. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">So, (pause) and because he s depressed, I think it s harder for him to make a commitment to something (pause) to go after. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so there s two side of it; there s your empathy for what s hard for him. Then there s also what your needs in a relationship are and your needs for yourself. And a need for some privacy; some alone time is perfectly normal, even within the confines of a committed relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">There s nothing that says people in a committed relationship need to spend all their time together. (pause) And even all their free non-work time together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it would so much like if we actually lived, and had a two-bedroom apartment, I could just go to the other room and that would be fine. Like I don t need him to be out of the building, I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: But there isn t that space in your apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: But there isn t that space in my apartment. (pause) So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: So it does mean either him being out of the apartment because he s got his own thing going on, or spending some time in your own apartments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, (pause) I guess I will suggest that to him. (pause) It still doesn t explain why it turned into so much anger, and I was just like, oh well, even if we do have a sex life back, in theory I m still mad and angry, so obviously this didn t solve the problem. Therefore it wasn t the only <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201251\">problem; therefore, I don t even know if things are going to work and sort of haven t. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20124-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20124-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: Ah. So how did it become about sex?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: Well it wasn t about sex; it was just thinking, oh I thought that sex would make this not happen anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Being mad at him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yes; for being that mad at him. Especially in this case, because he didn t do anything wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: But you were feeling resentful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: And so can you name what exactly you felt resentful about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: (pause) I guess the lack of privacy. I m not sure if there was something else there, but I think it was the lack of privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yeah, feeling kind of trapped and limited by it. That s what -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">CLIENT: Well it was already like 10 or 11 at night at that point. So, I couldn t have reasonably asked him to spend the night at his place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like it wasn t really about anything that happened that night; it was feelings about a pattern that happened to, for whatever reason, come out that night.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">CLIENT: But I still don t want to feel that angry, and I want to figure out how to not feel that angry. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Well it might be that feeling like more of your needs are acknowledged and respected can help you to not feel that angry. And some of those needs are sexual, but you have as a complex human being, you have lots of needs. You have a need for privacy; you have a need for sexual fulfillment; <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F1\">you have a need for companionship; you have a need for feeling, you know, productive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">And there s lots of those things that haven t been met. And some of those things, you expect your partner to help you with, and some you don t. I have a feeling, you know, you re carrying a lot of guilt about needing your parents financial support, and that s not a need that your boyfriend can help <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201411\">you fill. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">But there are needs you kind of expect him to help you with. The sexuality piece; respect for privacy and boundaries is something that we really do negotiate in a relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it wasn t like he was being overly invasive or anything, I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: He was overly there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Not just in that moment, but he s been overly there (pause) for a really long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: But it s not like it s something that I constantly get annoyed out or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: When does it annoy you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: When are the good times and when are the hard times?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: I guess it just annoys me when I m well either if I ve already been fighting with him about something. And then just want to get away, and can t. (pause) Or, it s just like when I felt like I couldn t do something I d want to, just because he was there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: You would feel limited. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: It s just like I feel self-conscious. (pause) Like it s not even like I d be doing anything on the Internet that he wouldn t like or anything. It s just (pause) I feel self-conscious being watched. (pause) And even if he wouldn t actually be watching me, you know, anything with audio sound would <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201591\">something he could hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">And I don t know why I was so angry that I thought that headphones wasn t a good solution. (pause) But because they re his headphones, and ideally I d just be able to do it without headphones. Which is stupid, because especially that sound of my computer sucks and headphones make that better. My computer <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B1\">can t be that loud anyways, so I don t know why I was all like yeah, I want to watch videos without headphones, when maybe headphones would actually be the solution. And it just wouldn t give me another time where I m mad at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2015A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: If you were maybe at that point too mad to accept a reasonable solution, because you just wanted to be mad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: Sometimes once you start feeling something, you re so vested in that perception. And having that feeling, and having your perception of the issue match what you feel, and it s hard to let in an alternative. You know, I think that s something I ve I think we ve experienced together, when there s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201611\">something that you see or you believe to be a certain way. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">You re pretty set on it, and it s hard sometimes to have flexibility to see another solution or another option.

And maybe you didn t want to let go of being mad right then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: Okay, but then how do I like, if I want to feel something, stop wanting to feel it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) what makes it if you had asked yourself, What do I really want? Do I want to be mad? Or do I want (pause) what s the alternative? What would have been the alternative? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Well I guess possibly Sydney going home for a few hours. Like having the place to myself for that night. Possibly, I mean this one wouldn t actually be possible, but it would be nice if he could like take Sammy with him for an evening, because that s the other thing, is that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Oh, you re also frustrated with the cat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: The cat, and I couldn t I can t get away from the I guess I can shut the cat out of the room for awhile, and (pause) you know, it won t hurt him, because he ll have access to his food and his litter box. But it does make the cat upset, but I could be just like whatever; I don t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201791\">(chuckle) it s not like it s that cruel to shut him out of the room for an hour or something. You know, I wouldn t be abandoning him for a day.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so not only did you feel kind of trapped by Sydney, but you also kind of felt trapped by the cat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so we re identifying some stuff here. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: And I guess I also (pause) I will turn this to silent (pause) there we go; okay, it ll stop buzzing now. He (sigh) I guess because he was the one who was more excited about getting the kitten, and I have been considering getting an adult cat. And then, yeah, this is actually it was actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201811\">a good decision, especially because now I decided I m going to because I don t even like, though I did get an extension on the signing the lease, I decided I didn t want to spend my entire salary on rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">So I m looking to live with roommates, and one of the people who I m going to be talking to (pause) is she has a cat too. And the thing about Kelly is that she can t deal with other cats, we found out. (pause) So if I d adopted Kelly, then I d be in a bit of trouble in terms of I couldn t live with <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201831\">someone else who had a cat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">But, well I mean, then again, there re all these other cats besides Harrold and besides Kelly that I could ve like gotten an adult can who wasn t either of them who didn t always try to claw me. And so it s just I know it s temporary; he s a kitten; he ll stop being a kitten; he ll probably be less <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201851\">crazy always attacking my yarn and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">But it s just like ah, here I am not being able to knit. I m finally knitting again, and I can t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">THERAPIST: And partly because this was Sydney s influence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah, because he was the one who really wanted the kitten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: So being mad at the kitten and also being mad at having to incorporate Sydney s opinion and need or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: Especially because originally, I was sort of thinking it was like you know, when I decided to let my parents keep Hank, I didn t even think I could keep care for a cat. And was like, terrified of getting one. (pause) Was like okay, I don t need a cat. So I mean in the end, it was like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F1\">don t mind. Taking care of the cat isn t the problem, it s the when he goes crazy, and claws and (pause) won t let me knit. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: Frustrating behaviors, and then you kind of part of you thinks I m dealing with these because of Sydney.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">THERAPIST: It s not completely separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">CLIENT: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: And so that s part of why you felt so mad at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But I don t know how to stop (sigh).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Well, so I mean there s two parts of that. Part of that is (pause) you know, maybe something to work on as part of the couples therapy is balancing whose needs are being met in the relationship, and are there compromises in both directions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">And how much are you compromising of what you want and you need? And how much is he compromising? How much compromises are needed to be? I think that s something that might be that you need to kind of look at in couples therapy, so that it feels balanced. When it s imbalanced, is when those feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F1\">of resentment, and anger crop up and you re clearly feeling those sometimes.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">The other piece to look at, and this is maybe more of your own work is, once you ve made a compromise; once you ve agreed to something, being able to accept responsibility for it. I mean so Sydney voiced his opinion about wanting a kitten versus a cat; you agreed. Well, so now you ve agreed to that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A11\">you have to sort of take responsibility; that s your decision now. That wasn t Sydney s decision; you decided to agree to his need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">And so looking at this in the bigger picture, it s not just about the cat, but it s about looking at the pattern of the relationship, and looking at if you re agreeing to these compromises, then you really have to own them, once you say okay. You don t necessarily need to say okay to everything, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A31\">once you do, then that s a Georgia decision, not -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">CLIENT: Then I guess the other things was that it like it didn t help that he wasn t happy with me being mad at the cat, and I was like, Cat, I shouldn t have gotten you. Things that it s okay to say to a cat, because he doesn t speak English. But it was like, You re saying all these horrible things <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A51\">about the cat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you re feeling really judged. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I m not allowed to be mad at the cat. (pause) So (pause) yeah, it was just this whole so maybe that s when I started being mad at him; the things I don t really remember exactly what -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">THERAPIST: When the feeling came.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, the cat came first I think. And then it was him, and I think that might have been it, but I m not sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Well I think going through these examples is useful in thinking about when; when are the patterns getting repeated? And when do the feelings those feelings of anger, and feelings of resentment; noticing when they come up, because if there s patterns; if there s repeated instances; similar <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF1\">types of things going on, then they re really important to talk about when he and you re in your couples work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It s just not being able to stop myself in the moment. That just is really frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Understanding the feelings can help you to make choices about how to respond them. When you feel overwhelming, and we can t understand why we re feeling a certain way, it s hard to choose an appropriate response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">It s not so much that the feeling is inappropriate, but it s the way, you know, the way you express it, or the way you respond to it, that you have some control over. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">THERAPIST: When really, it feels out of control. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">CLIENT: I don t I just don t know like when I had when I was gone for weekend, I missed Vicodin and at was first I was really happy to be back, but then it just sort of was all overwhelming and I have no privacy. And the cat is trying to claw me.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">He goes through like he can be really really sweet, but he also doesn t know better about using his claws on people, even though we ve been trying to teach him. Then he was, you know, my arm was moving around, and it makes sense that a cat would want my (overlapping voices) with yarn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Sure, that knitting sounds like a fabulously fun game to play for cats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it s like, you know, I can throw him off the bed, but that doesn t actually teach him why I m throwing him off the bed. (pause) And that s why we can t reason with a kitten. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah and it can be really frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">CLIENT: I guess it might mean that I ll have to take my knitting out of the house in the future. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, find another place to go for now, until he kind of grow out of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think he ll grow out of that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Or, I mean another solution; one of the things that you said, you know, you were sort of mad at Sydney for not helping you there. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">THERAPIST: What if he had taken a ball of inexpensive yarn, and gone and played with the kitten someplace?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D1\">CLIENT: That probably would have helped. Well actually I don t know, because some cats, you know, they ll know that you re trying to if this is a ball of yarn that is meant for the cat, he s obviously going to want to go for one that s meant for you. So it might have worked. But yeah, Sydney wasn t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D11\">really helping or anything. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D3\">Oh, (chuckle) and the other thing that had went wrong was I was supposed to give him his oral meds, and his oral meds were really goopy, and I didn t know whether I could probably do it. Sydney was like, Oh well, it s probably fine. And I m like, How can you know? What if these medicines are ruined forever? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D5\">And in the end, waiting, giving it some time to warm up, because it has been it s supposed to be stored in the frig, but I m thinking the frig was too cold. But this all confused me, because the first bottle of meds was fine, and this should be the exact same thing. But still, you know, that going <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D51\">wrong, and I can t even medicate the cat, it just all exploded.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D7\">THERAPIST: You felt really overwhelmed, and like you weren t getting enough help; enough space; enough empathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, because then also I was resenting the cat for having to medicate him, and having a medication I mean it s not his fault that the medication went weird, but, you know, (sigh) (pause). I am having to medicate him until his ringworm goes away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DD\">CLIENT: So, (pause) and basically everything piled on top of each other and probably, I mean, didn t help that I I guess I only had to drive that last half hour or so, so (pause) that probably wasn t a big factor, but yeah, just all (pause) went in together to the ball of craziness. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DF\">THERAPIST: A lot of things it felt like you weren t getting enough too many responsibilities, and not enough help, and not enough attention to sort of what you wanted and needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I feel like I m always you know, I don t mind always being the one to feed the cat or clean the litter box, but if I m always the one to have to put him down, or get him off the bed, or get him out of the way if I m trying to eat or something like that, just feels like like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201E11\">he ll sometimes attack Sydney too, but I think he goes for me more often.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Well I can understand your frustration and resentment that you were feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E5\">CLIENT: It just feels like I made such a mistake by getting a kitten in the first place. (pause) Because clearly, I couldn t handle a kitten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like that all the time, or it feels like that it felt it in that moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E9\">CLIENT: It felt like that in that moment; it doesn t feel like that all the time. Most of the time, he s really sweet, and he ll sit on your lap, and you pet him and you know, be really really nice. It s just when he gets crazy playful, because I couldn t get a second kitten to play with him. And if <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201E91\">I had gotten a second kitten, it probably would have solved most the problems. So the two could have just played with each other, instead of coming to get me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Then he does need your play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF\">THERAPIST: And Sydney s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">CLIENT: I mean I don t mind playing with him, I mind the fact that he claws me during this play. (pause) And not as bad as Sydney is; Sydney s arm is all marked up, that it looks like he s cutting himself or something, but it s the cat.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735404\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F3\">Even on my way to the job, I was trying to get dressed for my job interview, and the cat was following me around, and then he ended up I think he clawed my finger by accident. But he clawed my finger to the point that it was bleeding, and since I didn t have any Band-Aids, I needed gauze and tape. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201F31\">So I came into the interview with my finger with gauze on it and stuff, because the cat had clawed me so bad. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F5\">THERAPIST: That s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F9\">THERAPIST: I wanted to take a minute just to also check in about exercise and eating, which we know are things that have been on your list of things that are important to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So something I ve actually been doing for eating is that we re getting sushi, and I don t like fish that might always have vegetables in them. And, you know, it s vegetables, and rice and seaweed. So it feels a lot healthier than a lot of the other stuff I eat. So <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FD\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a good addition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. It s kind of expensive, but Sydney really likes it, and doesn t mind paying for it. So I think that s helping with eating, and the exercising; I haven t been doing as much. I mean, since I got the job now, I ll be walking to The T for however long that takes, and then walking from The <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201FF1\">T to (pause) the office, which is that s a 10, 15-minute walk; maybe a little bit less. But so I ll be getting more walking in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20201\">But I haven t my Tuesday contra had three weeks off, and I think this week is (pause) this week is the second or last week of it. But, you know, but I couldn t (chuckle) because of like the social barriers with swing dancing, I haven t made myself go swing dancing all the weeks that I didn t have contra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20203\">THERAPIST: So on these days when it s not rainy, which feel few and far between, but are there? Maybe even before work starts, not relying on work necessarily to get you those walks; maybe taking advantage of this weather to practice those walks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20205\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I should do that, and I I have been walking about we did a lot of walking at Providence, and a lot of it was uphill, and I felt tired from that. I was like wow; not going to contra dancing is clearly not helping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20207\">THERAPIST: Yeah so see if you can fit some of that in this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20209\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Anything else we should catch up on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020D\">CLIENT: (pause) I think we should figure out (chuckle) the scheduling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know you want help with that. All right, so let s turn to that. (pause) So anyway, you said you weren t quite sure of your start date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">CLIENT: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">THERAPIST: Would you want to meet this Friday on the sixth?
