My performance review got rescheduled for today. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) I\u2019m only laughing because it sucks to have to push out the dread.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yesterday I taught my first course on statistics to my co-workers. I had scheduled it for a time \u2013 I didn\u2019t check everyone\u2019s schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Is this the 1:00, as opposed to the 11:00?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. When I had scheduled it, I tried to track the managers\u2019 schedules, but not any of the employees because there were 75 people\u2019s schedules to track and there\u2019s just never going to be a slot. So I picked what all the managers could make, which conflicted with this guy, Rob. He\u2019s not in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">group; he\u2019s in a sister group  So Pete rescheduled his 1:00, which then caused a cascade of rescheduling, which caused my boss to need to be in a meeting (laughs) when we had my performance review scheduled. So it\u2019s kind of my fault, but not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah, except not really at all. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: But the class went well. People gave me kind comments afterwards, including my boss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I actually stayed focus on work and did not browse the Internet until about 3:30, so yay me. It was after 3:30. The day was kind of a wash. Sort of unusual, but I\u2019ll take it. It turns out the thing at 11:00 that I thought was due next week is actually due next week. The agenda that my boss sent <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">out on Tuesday was confusing, so yesterday was not a disaster. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I still feel like work overall is a disaster, though, largely because of focus or lack thereof. (pause) At MIT, the mental health staff was just so overwhelmed. There was not nearly enough staff to deal with all of the student issues. If you went in complaining of lack of focus, they would just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">give you Adderall and send you on your way. It was ridiculously easy to acquire a prescription, which made it legal, if not necessarily, the most healthy or ethical choice.  But being on stimulants does help me just get work done, not in a way that I think is good for me. I guess if you\u2019re only measuring <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">goodness by what your work output is, then it\u2019s an A++, but . . . (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: What do you mean, then, about it being in a way that\u2019s not good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: (sighs) I have a tendency, once something gets my attention, to hyper-focus on it and become obsessive about it.  Adderall just amplifies that effect for me, so all I have to do is get just enough focus on work to slip into that hyper-focused state of mind, almost a fugue state, and then I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">work straight for six or eight or ten hours without taking breaks or eating or getting water or using the restroom \u2013 and that\u2019s really not . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: This was at Harvard?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I can see how that would not have felt healthy. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think my issue with getting work done is a generalized problem with attention or ability to focus. I don\u2019t think it is classic ADD, I think it\u2019s other stuff that prevents me from being able to exercise focus. I try and exercise focus on things other than work. (laughs) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I agree with what you say. I think there are some things that are similar, actually, about you keep hyper-focus. You talk about work, when you\u2019re taking Adderall and, in a way, the similar kind of absorption, I think, that goes along with your feeling shut down at work, it seems like you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">would have thought to call it [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:09).  But it does seem to me you\u2019re kind of similarly absorbed with a crushing, overwhelming, very immediate sense of almost like how horrible you are. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562168\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: When I get sucked into a game or a time-wasting distraction, it\u2019s exactly the same sort of hyper-focus and ability to disengage. Society rewards you if you do that with work products, right? Whereas it doesn\u2019t do that if you do that with video games, but it\u2019s the same, I think, mechanism. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\"> Last fall I ordered paper for this book that I was going to print for Penelope and that feel apart. Did I mention this yesterday? I ordered color stock instead of . . . yeah. So I didn\u2019t realize I had ordered the wrong thing until \u2013 I was in Montana, actually, because I thought that Penelope\u2019s book <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">is half the size of the book that I\u2019m printing now and I was going to do half the number of copies.  I thought I had enough paper to do some pages, but I need to order paper now so I have enough to finish the book. So I went to look at my invoice to see what I had ordered so I could make sure to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">the same color, the same thickness, and I realized I had ordered cover instead of text. I got home late, late Monday night, like 2:00 AM, and didn\u2019t do anything about it and then Tuesday I was so overwhelmed with being unhappy about work that I completely forgot I needed to deal with paper. Yesterday <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200314\">I looked at the paper before I came here, just to confirm that the invoice was what I got and I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t use this paper.\u201d I completely freaked out. I tried to order paper online because [Legion Paper] (ph?) actually has a really fast turn-around time.  If I had gotten my order in yesterday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200315\">they would have shipped today and it would have arrived by tomorrow. I would have been fine, but their website was broken. Their shopping cart wouldn\u2019t let me order, which was really frustrating, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to just pick up the phone and call them. Now I feel really stupid because if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200316\">I had just called them on my lunch break yesterday, I would have my paper. Now I\u2019m not sure if I order it today and they ship it tomorrow, it might or might not arrive Saturday morning. I might or might not be able to print on Saturday and just \u2013 arggh. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite in this way, but this is reminding me of what you were saying about reminding me of a paper in the psych clinic literature, which I\u2019m mentioning because I think it doesn\u2019t describe how I\u2019m thinking or feeling, but I think you\u2019ll identify with what they\u2019re talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">about.  It\u2019s a paper called A Mind of One\u2019s Own, and in it, the author is writing about an experience that [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:21) and have in which a patient puts a pressure on you, without really realizing to or intending to or interacts in such a way that doesn\u2019t leave you any room to think and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">that makes you feel like you\u2019re in, I imagine, some kind of catastrophe or shut down in a way or overwhelmed in a way that you have no room to think. The idea is that there is some way in which the patient can\u2019t bear to think.  It\u2019s sort of giving over some of that to you, like focus a reflection of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">their own experience and, as a demonstration of their anxiety, that you will be able to put them in touch with the things that they\u2019re so overwhelmed by that they can\u2019t stop and think about them. What I want to be clear about is that I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re doing that to me, but I think you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200334\">what that\u2019s like. I do think there are ways you bring things up in here that I don\u2019t think, necessarily, have that effect in me, but pull a little bit for that in a way that I think is reflective of a kind of shutdown on your part. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562168\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">An example would be what you just said. Often, when this comes up, it\u2019s because you\u2019re talking about something that\u2019s actually impossible, like \u201cI have this huge project, huge deadline; they thought it was due last week. I\u2019m not done yet. Management is going to come down on my manager and on me like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">a ton of bricks.\u201d But in a way, it\u2019s already happened in that case, so it\u2019s impossible. Or what you\u2019re talking about now with the paper. But actually I was thinking about this even before you mentioned the paper because it seems like what you\u2019re saying about the work with the Adderall or with the computer <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">games.  (long pause) I think it\u2019s sort of a crucial aspect of a lot of what you\u2019re struggling with.  It\u2019s a way that when you\u2019re feeling off and, I guess, the shame or self-hatred gets so intense, you can\u2019t bear it anymore and shut down at the cost of also not being able to think and being a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200353\">distance, or maybe mildly dissociated from what you\u2019re feeling, which, that dissociative thing of you kind of feel it and you know you feel awful, but you\u2019re also not really feeling it. Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s not a fun vacation, is what I mean. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like a vacation from my parents \u2013 technically a vacation, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s probably extremely apt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: It causes you to spend your vacation days without actually getting any rest or relaxation out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah. (long pause)  I think a way that this probably plays out between you and me is actually that. I think at times I say things that point towards how you feel or towards what you might think about that may not be wrong, but can be overwhelming.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: (sniggers) Brainstorming ways to use up all that cover stock. I could do broadsides, but then I\u2019d have to deal with selling broadsides and then shipping broadsides. Oh, God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s a broadside?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Oh, sorry. A broadside is a printed format.  It was used in the 1700s \u2013 1800s for news of interest in the town or announcements or service flyers, but in contemporary usage, it often means a poem or a stand-alone piece of text, generally not more than 500 words or so, along with some artwork <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">printed in a format suitable for printing and hanging on a wall. I really like broadsides. They\u2019re fun. I have a lot of them at home, but the market for them is teeny tiny and shipping them is a pain in the ass. And I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll be easier to ship than a firm cover stock versus something soft <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">enough that you can roll it into a tube. (sighs) Man.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562168\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: How much was the cover stock?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: $250.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s the money you\u2019re talking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yep. I mean I\u2019ve spent more on stupider things before, but that\u2019s about what I spent on that print for Thomas that I bought last fall.  (pause) It\u2019s an amount of money where, had there not been a mistake on my part involved in the process of acquiring it, I wouldn\u2019t think anything about spending <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">that quantity of money on a [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:31). The fact that I screwed up suddenly makes it feel like oh, my God, that\u2019s a huge amount of money. What is wrong with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right, like if you had traveled to go see a show, someone that you wanted to see. Then it\u2019s not a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But since I now have paper that I don\u2019t really want and cannot easily make use of, and that will cause more work for me \u2013 and it\u2019s a reminder that I was inattentive when I placed the order and ordered the wrong thing and didn\u2019t notice for six months.  It\u2019s now grown in perceived <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">magnitude. (sighs) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: And I think it comes in pretty handy in relation to what we\u2019re talking about. (pause) It\u2019s really painful and awful, but safer, too, to be beating yourself up; and not for nothing, in your experience. You have told me how that have otherwise often leads to being hurt. (long pause)  Let me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">back up for a minute. You\u2019re saying that the $250 can just loom quite a lot larger when it\u2019s attached to your fucking up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: In other words, I guess it can feel like a much more significant amount of money than, curiously, it can feel like when it\u2019s doing you some good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Yep. (pause) In part it\u2019s all based on what I compare it to. $250 is what I spent to go see the Suge concert in West Virginia last fall. It was awesome. $250 is also the maximum amount of money I was allowed to spend on clothes in an entire year when I was growing up, so that\u2019s a year\u2019s wardrobe, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">right? Comparing it to a weekend trip makes it feel like a lot less important than comparing it to all the clothes I get to wear all year, even though it\u2019s not the budget I have for clothing right now.  That was a big thing when I was growing up. I had a $250 budget for the entire year and you had better <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200572\">be careful about what clothes you asked mom and dad to buy because . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: It comes out of that money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) And, of course, when you\u2019re ten, $250 feels like an enormous amount of money. (pause) Although $250 is, on average, a day\u2019s salary after taxes. Actually, I\u2019m not sure; it\u2019s somewhere in that ballpark. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: So you mean that\u2019s the example you think of when you\u2019re thinking of how significant $250 can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: So that was, according to your parents, all you should spend on clothes in a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)  I feel vaguely uncomfortable being so explicit about numbers and how much money I spend on things and how much money I have and how much I earn, but that might just be like social [ ] (inaudible at 00:32:14) that talking about money is gauche or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s the way that you feel awkward about it? Uncomfortable, like you\u2019re being gauche?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562168\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes, or perhaps insensitive, since I have no idea what your finances are like and it would be inappropriate for me to know that anyway. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: I see.  So you might be acting both socially awkward and making me feel bad or ashamed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, or resentful or pitying or whatever, depending on what relative positioning, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: But something bad any which way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Just to be clear. (both laugh) As opposed to glad for you [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:33) or compassionate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Right. I run into this a lot with my friends. When I was at Harvard and immediately post from Harvard, it was reasonable to assume that all of my friends came from the same rough social, socio-economic background as I did.  And certainly once we all got jobs, our parents income didn\u2019t matter <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">anymore. We were all working the same kinds of jobs with the same kind of pay \u2013 high-tech, high-paid, engineering, computer-science jobs. And then I started meeting and hanging out with people who are poets and try to make a living off their poetry or who pay their rent by working at Starbuck\u2019s as a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">barista and do historiography in their spare time because that\u2019s their professional interest and you can\u2019t get paid to study the history of historians. Go figure. Corporate America doesn\u2019t reward that. Here is an immediately relevant example. There is a restaurant in Connecticut, that does a festival <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200733\">of game meats in February, like antelope and elk and venison. I thought this was super cool and my friends thought it was super cool, so I e-mailed a bunch of people and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get a group together and go out to Student Prince and Fort for Game Fest.\u201d  But their meal prices are \u2013 you should expect <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200734\">to spend $30 $40 per person for a meal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Sure, antelope can\u2019t be cheap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Right. I consider that a little bit of a splurge. I wouldn\u2019t do that every week or even every month, but for a special event or a special occasion, like a birthday or an anniversary or whatever, I consider that totally reasonable. But some of the people I invited were like, \u201cThat is completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">unaffordable for me. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d Even as a once-in-a-while splurge. Lots of people said that was Lucy; and then I didn\u2019t know how to offer to pay for her because then, not only have I kind of rubbed it in my face that I can just go out to this dinner without thinking about it, I can afford to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">pay for two people to go out to this dinner without even blinking.  I don\u2019t know how to do that in a way that isn\u2019t condescending and doesn\u2019t reinforce class oppression and doesn\u2019t make the other person feel bad. In this case, the point was moot because Lucy\u2019s boyfriend also wanted to go and he has <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200773\">reasonable family wealth that he\u2019s sitting on, so he decided to pay for it. They have an established relationship where he does that. I guess they have sorted that out between them. If he weren\u2019t interested in going, I would have had to address that question. I don\u2019t know how to navigate that sort of thing gracefully.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: It seems like part of where you\u2019re getting stuck is, I think, you start with the assumption that what you do will make the other person feel bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, when what I do has the potential of making the other person feel bad, I\u2019d like to avoid that. (pause) In part, it\u2019s because I feel bad when friends who are wealthier than me just throw around some of the money that I don\u2019t have, friends who don\u2019t just work pet jobs, but got lucky in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">start-up game and sold Google for $10 billion \u2013 not that Jeff got all $10 billion. Much of that went to his co-owners and stockholders and then paying them.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562168\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right. That percentage of $10 billion . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: Right. Even single digit percentages of that are vast sums of money.  That\u2019s seed money for another company. That\u2019s a level of money I don\u2019t ever expect to have just sitting in my bank account, right? So Jeff does things like \u201cI\u2019m going to rent a yacht for my friends for a week and we\u2019re just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F1\">going to have a week-long party and get high all week.\u201d Wow. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Personally, I don\u2019t get the sense that makes you feel that bad. I mean, I would imagine you would like to do that for your friends, but I don\u2019t have the sense that . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: I\u2019m a little bit jealous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: Maybe this is just my pathology and normal people don\u2019t do that, but it makes me reason that all of the life choices I made that caused me to \u2013 you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: Not wind up in that situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Be a worker, be in a Fortune 500 company instead of an entrepreneur starting my own companies and selling them to Google.  Not that everyone who starts a company gets to sell to Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: Just like not every athlete gets to be Lebron James, but if you don\u2019t play you don\u2019t get the opportunity. If you don\u2019t start any companies at all, you\u2019re definitely not going to sell a company to Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: I stand corrected. I can see how it can make you feel bad and ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Maybe normal people don\u2019t do that. Maybe they might just feel a twinge of envy and then move on with their lives and be happy for their friends, but the more I\u2019m hanging out with that set of my friends, or maybe even that class \u2013 ha ha \u2013 I have to work really hard not to send myself into an <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">emotional tailspin.  Timothy is buying his third vacation home because three houses weren\u2019t enough? I don\u2019t understand that kind of wealth. (long pause)  A sort of related thing \u2013 maybe not really related, but it\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about right now \u2013 having this conversation with Lo over the weekend <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200932\">about Tracey, who is dating Lucy and is married to Matilda who is dating Lo.  I haven\u2019t talked about Tracey much, but Tracey intimidates the hell out of me. Tracey is extraordinarily smart and extraordinarily incisive and has expertise in fields that I have never even thought about. Tracey has studied <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200933\">history and urban planning in college and does literary reviews and is published in literary journals. She knows lots and lots about medieval Europe and about folklore and the roots of contemporary American culture and can trace back various aspects of our culture to where their originating points in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200934\">Europe were, et cetera, et cetera. She is just very incredibly smart in fields I\u2019ve never studied and I\u2019m intimidated by that. Lo was thinking, \u201cWhy are you so intimidated by Tracey? You\u2019re just as smart as Tracey. You know people who are smarter from Harvard, both smarter than me and smarter than Tracey.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200935\"> Well, it\u2019s hard for me to be intimidated by people who went through Harvard, especially by people who went through Harvard at the same time I did, even if they are more successful than me or smarter than me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562168\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: Tracey did not go to Harvard, I gather?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Right. Tracey went to Bryn Mawr for undergrad and then Yale for grad school. I can\u2019t remember if they got the PhD or they left with a Masters. So it\u2019s just as prestigious as Harvard, but \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Having that shared experience and background, it\u2019s really hard for people from Harvard to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">intimidate me, whereas people who didn\u2019t can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something like a kind of foreignness, both in the field that she is interested in and where she went to school and stuff that makes her more imposing or something. We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: See you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: See you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
