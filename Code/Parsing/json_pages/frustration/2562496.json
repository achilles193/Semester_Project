It\u2019s nice to see you, too. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I feel like Gavin is busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s peculiar that he hasn\u2019t gotten back to me. It\u2019s not quite like him, but I assume that means he\u2019s busy or something. I had one other thought of someone who I\u2019ve shared cases with and referred people to before and who also I hear good reports of and who I think is good.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Maybe it\u2019s time that Jeremy tries people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t try Gavin because he hasn\u2019t gotten back to me, but he could try this other person, who is Fern Toms in Waltham.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I can send you the number and stuff if you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Okay.  Does Gavin come to mind as being a better fit, like if Jeremy were to just wait until Gavin has time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s just really hard to know. One thing I liked about Gavin for Jeremy is that Gavin is also trained as a neuro-psychologist, which means he knows a lot about ADHD and has probably seen a bunch of times some of this stuff and has struggled with that. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">he just has a very articulated sense of that, as well, as being an analyst who has worked closely with a lot of people. Tammy is not trained as a neuro-psychologist, but she is a really good therapist.  She\u2019s a good analyst. She\u2019s very smart, and I\u2019m sure she has seen people with ADHD before; she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">just not specialized in that kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: She\u2019s a woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yes, as it turns out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Gavin is a man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yes. Right. That was the other thing \u2013 you had mentioned maybe a man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, he said that he might prefer to see a man, but he wasn\u2019t really sure why or if that\u2019s true. I think that Jeremy has bad stuff in the corners, hiding. I think he has lots of mom stuff out in the open and, somehow, all the women in his life in this role \u2013 like almost everybody has been a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">woman, except Brandon Miles in college.  Then just over the course of his troubles . . . I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m talking about, but I have a hunch that has to do with Jeremy\u2019s relationship with his dad. Maybe it doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I guess the other thing that comes to mind is that Fern, I think, can be challenging. She\u2019s very empathic, but she\u2019s not warm and fuzzy and supportive. She\u2019s kind of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Which I think tends to be good. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Is she a meditator?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Not that I know of, but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: You need someone who is really smart and quick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Both of them are very smart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I said that to Jeremy and he said, \u201cAllison, most therapists are very smart.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not so sure about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m not sure about that either because with his track record, I don\u2019t know. The last one, at least, was not smart about her. Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Jeremy wouldn\u2019t come through Providence ever, would he? There are also a couple of people I thought of through there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Do you want to tell me about them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Sure. Those are both kind of more senior-type people in their 60\u2019s and so both have done a lot of child work, so they know the ADHD stuff backwards and forwards.  They\u2019re also just experienced, wonderful, very smart people. They like taking classes (inaudible at 00:07:21) that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562496\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Two people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yes.

Riley Carver and Sirius Moby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Cool names.  Riley Carver and Sirius Moby. Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I guess I didn\u2019t think of them at first because they\u2019re not in Providence and they\u2019re probably more expensive, but they\u2019re both pretty awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Awesome, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think Brandon and Fern are awesome, too. I just sort of know them a different way.

That\u2019s weird for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: And then I don\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to pick up the phone and call these people, so I don\u2019t consider Brandon\u2019s slowness to be \u2013 like we\u2019re in a hurry so we\u2019re going to drop him.  I\u2019m in a hurry; Jeremy is not in a hurry. (both chuckle) Okay. Thanks. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: The more I think about it, if he can make the Providence geography work with either of those two, I would try to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Riley is probably less expensive than Sirius, and not for any good reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Maybe she\u2019s a more reasonable person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s a very reasonable person. It\u2019s probably like he\u2019s a psychiatrist and they sometimes tend to charge more, where she\u2019s a psychologist.  Also, he\u2019s probably been a little more visible in some ways than she has, so there are probably a lot of wealthy people go to see him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: He doesn\u2019t really need to charge less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s cut-rate or something. She\u2019s very good and has a very good reputation. Some of it, yeah, he can be a [blunt] (ph?) personality though, too, but he\u2019s not arrogant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: What do you think they charge \u2013 ballpark?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know.

(long pause)  I called you on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: You did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: I did, but I didn\u2019t leave a message. You didn\u2019t know. I called you at around 9:30 in the morning because I couldn\u2019t leave.  I think this has been close to happening a bunch of times before, but it has never really happened. I was paralyzed. (pause) I left here and I left the building and I felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200851\">like I was walking through sand or something, like a wall of sand.  I just couldn\u2019t walk anymore. You go through a little alley and there is a little bench on the left. I started to cry a lot and I was really cold. It was like 16\u00b0. It sort of felt like I just wanted to collapse, but I walked over to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200852\">the bench and I couldn\u2019t get up for like a half hour. I didn\u2019t want to go. (pause) I called you and I called Jeremy. Jeremy actually called me back. It took a while, but he managed to help peel me off the bench. I didn\u2019t want to go to my lab. I didn\u2019t want to go away from you.  I was cold. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562496\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">When I turn around and look at you and you move like you do sometimes, it\u2019s kind of a nice thing. (pause) It\u2019s a nice connection. (long pause)  I\u2019m just really glad that you didn\u2019t know that I called, (long pause) considering (inaudible at 00:25:49), like I could still be sitting there on the bench, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">stuck. (long pause)  (inaudible at 00:26:32) (long pause)  I\u2019ve been pretty occupied with two thoughts. One is that you weren\u2019t here for part of today, sort of seductive thoughts about why you\u2019re here now and the made-up fantasy. The other thought is whether you would describe yourself as challenging, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200872\">like (inaudible at 00:29:52).

I\u2019m looking at your posture, the way you\u2019re sort of holding yourself and I guess I\u2019m teasing you here a little bit, but imagine that I got back <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">from Hawaii; I\u2019m fine; I got here at 4:30.  I think you\u2019re seeing for yourself how challenging that can be \u2013 you know, I think is being sympathetic to you \u2013 you being sympathetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s hard to tell you about what happened on Monday and not hear anything from you so far, so you\u2019re not holding me (inaudible at 00:33:20).  I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s in a way that leaves you out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: No, I (inaudible at 00:33:31).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause)  I\u2019ve been sort of anxious the past week. (pause) It feels like being cramming or pressured has anxiety springing out of it. (pause)  Not really now or here. (pause) I\u2019m starting to notice some of the same transferrential stuff that comes up here, coming up really intensely <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">and fast in my lab work. (pause) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s about Kelly only or other people or the work, just by being in the work.  It feels like it\u2019s happening at all three levels and here, and that\u2019s a lot of separation anxiety. It\u2019s like I have a really hard time leaving labs, like it\u2019s so intense there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200932\">and it\u2019s so many people wanting to interact with me and I am very fond of some of them and I\u2019ve know some of them for many years. Also I\u2019m very fond of some new people. I sort of feel like this matronly \u2013 not really matronly, but maybe like matriarch figure.  Both formally, for my undergrad I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">The Turk, the crazy Turkish scientist, Ali is sort of taking his direction from me. We\u2019re together in what he is doing. Joanne sort of has a very intense role for her.  Sometimes I feel like she is sucking my insight practices out of me for herself, like my sort of wisdom and steadiness, the tedious <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">bits of wisdom and steadiness that I might have on any given day. I sort of feel like they go to her because she needs them and sucks them out and knows about them, so it feels a little parasitic sometimes and it\u2019s worse because I think it\u2019s mostly bad in an intense sense. (pause)  I have sort of shifted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200952\">my way of being with Kelly. I\u2019m trying to make it a lot more honest and just transparent with her about my fears and how I\u2019m doing and she is responding really well to it. Younger graduate students are responding to me differently now. They feel like they can\u2019t cross that line with her and it\u2019s too <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200953\">scary. Three or four small things happened over the last week where I just sort of went into her office and told her what was on my mind and these things are important to the lab.  Sarah is very important to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562496\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">It\u2019s hard to figure out what the specific dynamics are, but the things that feel transferrential is I have the invasive thoughts of all these people all day and night. They just come right into my \u2013 I can\u2019t do anything else. They are just there. Kurt is probably the worst. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m much <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">of a leader for him, but he\u2019s so intense and works so much and has so little . . .  I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s just really difficult for me right now. He doesn\u2019t like his marriage that much and he just drinks and he binge works and he\u2019s very sweet. (pause) He\u2019s always there. He\u2019s always in the space. I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">a hard time leaving every day. It feels like it takes an hour to feel like my own person again after I leave, which is kind of similar to leaving here.  And the invasive thoughts feel very similar, like it\u2019s not so much what the thoughts are that are invasive, but the speed and my recoiling at them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200973\">Things slow down when I meditate. I have felt a lot of spaciousness at times, but it\u2019s really hard to get there, a place with quiet and space and focus. It\u2019s hard to access it just walking around. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">The same thing now: there is this rotating wheel of faces and words and everybody is asking me something or are having loud conversations that are really hard to block out. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t want to let it in, but it feels like I want my privacy. When I\u2019m not there, I don\u2019t want it. I have those <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">people on my mind. (pause)  Kelly is part of the rotating wheel, but I feel like I\u2019m kind of in touch with her. (pause) I\u2019m pretty nervous about my work, which is a figure, too, but she gets overshadowed by all the faces and the words and the sounds. (pause) It\u2019s very intense.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I guess, so far, it seems to me that it was hard to leave on Monday because this felt so intimate and so close and that there is something parallel going on at work with Kelly, who you are being much more open with, and with these other folks who are mostly being close with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. A little bit because when I showed up to work on Monday I was like weeping pretty much for a couple of minutes when I walked in the door. There was messy setback in my day that showed up over the weekend; and so to a lot of people, the weeping was about that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">the lab before. That was kind of a thing. Kurt asked if wanted a hug and I said yes.  So not just them only being close to me, me being a little bit close to them; but mostly feeling like I need to protect myself because it takes too much time and too much energy and is so draining for me to have all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D2\">the interpersonal stuff going on and try to birth a paper. That\u2019s kind of how I feel about it. I didn\u2019t want to leave. I thought our time on Monday was pretty difficult.  It did feel intimate. Then I go to my lab where it does feel like there is some parallel happening, but somehow . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562496\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: But not the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, not the same. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: My hunch is that it felt wrong to be leaving on Monday. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, it did. (pause) I was paralyzed. (pause) I think there is some of that lurking around always.  (long pause) I don\u2019t know when I left the building. I didn\u2019t feel paralyzed as I was leaving the building. It was the whole time, like I couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t walk.  Or if I did, I needed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">to go somewhere else to have this space, a neutral space, because I was afraid how you might react or something if I stayed here, if I stayed in the living room. (pause) I thought it would be too much [of your hands] (ph?) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You would be too much in my hands to be able to deal with my not reacting well. I didn\u2019t react well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Also, I really felt like I needed to cry a lot and that space felt so cramped to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: The waiting room?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I couldn\u2019t imagine letting out what felt like needed to come out, like I needed to be outside. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: The thing that is striking me is how it seems like a fantasy of being born.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: You think reborn?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Like the office and the building are my body and you leave and you\u2019re crying and you\u2019re paralyzed and inconsolable for a while. We\u2019re separate in a way that feels very wrong. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)  Like sort of feeling like I needed to be shown what to do, like being \u2013 I was going to say like being out of my head, like being pointed to the nipple. Even though I can smell it I can\u2019t get to it myself, but there was no nipple. There is just cold, hard no nipple. (long pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\"> I sort of feel like you might want to take credit for it or something, the birth. (pause) Or that you did it to me. I guess those are pretty different, right? I\u2019m not sure.  Certainly in the moment, it felt like you were doing something to me because you didn\u2019t call me back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: But not like all the way. It was just sort of like it felt like a crutch. I don\u2019t have to go to the lab because Jay might call me back. And then, when I got myself up and going to the lab, the relationship, your calling me back, shifted. It was sort of like well . . .  It felt more like reality, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">like \u201cI didn\u2019t leave a message\u201d that kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You were sort of back in the world in a different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) I think this is really, really hard for me because I don\u2019t know how to connect with you in a way that I feel like I need to to feel whole. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I may be misunderstanding, but (long pause) it\u2019s so disconcerting, I think.  I think it\u2019s like how much you want to feel like I am really holding you very tightly and I think sometimes it does feel that way, like at times on Monday. I think. (long pause)  It would take some of the (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">at 01:07:58) out of all of that if this were sort of more of a two-way street \u2013 if you, in a sense, had [a connect] (ph?) with me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562496\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: It feels like it takes my identity away to not. (pause) Like in my whole life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019re swallowed up? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m taken apart and not swallowed up. (long pause) Swallowing is like sort of a union.  I get stretched between that and being completely taken apart and sort of strewn, like my pieces are strewn everywhere. Whole, I think the word \u201cwhole\u201d is what I mean, not feeling that feeling, only parts. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\"> (long pause) But you were saying like it first comes from how much in your hands or arms I feel sometimes. Because of that, I\u2019m one or I need to feel like I could carry you.  (pause) To me it doesn\u2019t feel always that directional. To me it feels like the feeling carrying each other is part of what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C52\">need to feel whole or like that\u2019s what my conditioning is or that\u2019s sort of what I\u2019m coming here with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: It shows up a lot in smaller ways with other people, it occurred to me this week, what I said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s also feeling like me. (pause) Maybe your holding other people or your holding me is feeling like me in how I hold you, or like other people hold you and just (inaudible at 01:13:48). (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Certainly when I hold other people I feel a lot like you these days. I can think of, during the course of my whole life, there is some critical sense of intimate connectedness that sort of compulsively has to be there to be able to move on with my life. Like the anxiety around not being whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">in that way is so strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: I think this is part of the pre-history of the pigeon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah?  There is a new book about pigeons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: No kidding?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yes. It was reviewed in the New Yorker a couple of months ago. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I guess what I\u2019m thinking about is in a little more theoretical terms, which is not how I want to be thinking about it, but it seems most clear that way, which is something like it seems like part of the way you manage the sense of separation or the specter of separation or the longing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">be held and carried . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 01:16:22)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah . . . is by identifying. That helps fill the space, being like me, being like your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Oh. It is theoretical.  (pause) I think my mom does that \u2013 pretty hard core \u2013 more than me because she\u2019s had a lifetime of it, a much longer lifetime of it. What? [It\u2019s something.] (ph?) I think you\u2019re right. I think you\u2019re totally right, but when I think about what being like my mom is, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">me, it\u2019s really, really, really similar to what being like her mom is, to me.  It\u2019s really, really, really, similar to being like what her mom is. There is like this recursive identifying back and back, like the same way of managing the same things. It\u2019s weird. (pause) I don\u2019t mean weird like this doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD2\">happen to anybody, but it feels a little spooky. It feels a little eerie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it also feels inevitable. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562496\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Well, in one way, in that it\u2019s clear that there is any other way to be, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, that\u2019s even more than inevitable; that\u2019s like obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like shifting, so it\u2019s hard to place the obviousness or inevitability, but I\u2019m not aware of filling the space between Kelly and me by being Kelly, are you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: I guess I am thinking of your sort of being surprised to hear yourself refer to yourself as matronly at the lab, which I guess doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Kelly herself, but in some kind of internal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Kelly\u2019s got some bad things, but maybe she\u2019s got some good things that I don\u2019t pay as much attention to. She is the keeper of the love and the carrot, so it\u2019s hard to be that rational, actually, or objective about her right now.  I don\u2019t mean rational; I mean clear.
