[laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">It sounds like you felt like she was really understanding that you have some things to be very upset about and critical of. There's a validation of your criticism, at last! [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It did. And it also, I guess, felt good to me to have someone objective, professional, with no personal agenda saying to Ivan, \"This is a big deal.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And I additionally felt, I guess, a little-like that was reinforced, because Ivan talked to me about he saw Dr. Bourd (sp?) yesterday and he said that Dr. Bourd pointed out that you and Dr. Farrow (sp?) had both said that I had been doing a lot of work, and that he thought that he should voice that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">appreciation to me for the way I've been dealing with the situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And then Ivan, after saying, he prompted me-he said that I should say this, he said, \"I just want to let you know I do appreciate that you've been working a lot and I do see some changes in you and appreciate that you're letting me make some of these attempts.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">That was a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: That's huge, too!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: That was a big deal. So I guess the sum is that we have another appointment with her. I'm going to take, I guess, my whole lunch break on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">If I'm truthful, it's a mix of feelings. And I'm actually pretty resentful. Part of me is like, \"I really don't want to take my second full day at my new job and not get to eat lunch because I'm rushing across, timing everything out by the minute, and spending money on what's going to be a difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">session and then go back and pretend like it's not on my mind.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">That's a lot. Why should I have to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: That is a lot. That's a lot in your first week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's a lot. And I guess part of me, even if I feel willing [sighs] or I feel obligated to this, I am-I think it's maybe natural to resent it somewhat, because I felt like we were-I felt like I was doing a lot of work and putting a ton of time and money into these sessions for many, many months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And to find out that a lot of it was kind of-he was doing these other things along the way that I had no clue about. It feels like, \"Why am I doing this again?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I feel like that's normal. [laughs] I feel like that's like a-I feel okay about having that reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: So understandable. So understandable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And I feel okay, because it's not completely I mean, sometimes it feels like it but it's not completely overshadowing the-if I am going to give this any type of chance, I am going to-maybe I'm going to have some restrictions.  Like, I will go if this is happening, I will go if... But to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">consider doing it and continuing...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And even for you to be able to say, \"There's a part of me that really wants to go, because this is important to me,\" and, \"I simultaneously feel really resentful and angry about the fact that we're now almost getting started, after all this work already.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: You can have both of those feelings right next each other and not have the one feel like it has to erase or invalidate the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: They're both your feelings. And they're in conflict, even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">Does it feel to you, Ramona, like it is too much for your first week? I just want to make sure you also feel like...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes. No, it's too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Okay. Because that sounds valid. Is it the best idea? Do you want to wait until the following week, even though you might be in a different place? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I don't know. Because Dr. Farrow has a one-week policy, so we already would have to pay the whole fee (ph). It's almost impossible, because he made the appointment eight days in advance, and she's like, \"Well, I need to know by tomorrow, if it doesn't work.\" [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">So I think I have to go. But I had kind of voiced this (inaudible at 00:04:21). [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a lot on you, I'm just (crosstalk at 00:04:31).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: No, it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Maybe if you'd had the space to really think more about what you need. You do want to have the appointment, but if you'd waited another week, it wouldn't have been the end of the world and you'd have an easier first week of adjustment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">I also think if it's absolutely too much the day of, you cancel. You figure a way to pay for it. That's legitimate, too. That happens sometimes for people. I know it's expensive, but if it makes the whole thing just feel frenetically crazy, it's going to be a waste of your time anyway.  Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: The other thing is I think the lunchtime is probably the only opportunity. She said she could maybe do it really early Thursday morning, but I already said that's earmarked for me, if that's possible. So I think it's always going to be a lunchtime, if it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">I guess she sometimes does go 5:00 to 6:00, but she doesn't have any of those available, which I'm sure a lot of people who work 9:00 to 5:00, they took those slots. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">It's hard, because I think for those sessions especially, right afterwards, I'm so-there's so much going on. It might be hard to go back and... So we'll see, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I also wonder and sort of think that you're being in a different place around your and Ivan, too but what you are able to continue to facilitate so that the dynamic in the room changed. . So that Ivan, he's working on owning more of his stuff and talking more. And you're also saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">\"Yeah, no, I'm actually going to pass the ball to him and he can-I'm not going to lead off. Let's let Ivan talk.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">In some ways, I think that's a piece of what I could imagine opened up Dr. Farrow's empathy even more. Had it been just you complaining again and Ivan only, \"Look how she shames me by talking this way to me,\" it's a different kind of feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">And just as I said to you, your capacity to feel your complaints are totally legitimate. Not sort of insistently, urgently trying to find that they're legitimate, but yet it feels more like you embody just knowing it more allowed her to have that much more empathy towards you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">And I'm so glad.  It's really important that that space, that that being marked. And it's not coming from me, then, and it's not coming from Dr. Bourd, it's coming from this mutual person that knows both of you. That that is very real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: So I guess on the one hand, I feel like Ivan has continued to make some progress this week. We had agreed that Tuesday, after our session since we were agreeing to see each other twice a week we could do dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">Things kind of started off on the wrong foot, because he was going to meet me at the apartment at 1:00. We were going to leave by 1:30 at the latest, to allow an hour to drive there because sometimes with traffic, it can take a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">And at 1:20, he's still not there, still not there. In fact, he had asked, \"Can I come over at noon? I just want to see you for a little bit. We can get a start on dinner.\" I said, \"No, why don't we just stick with 1:00?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">So 1:20, he's not there. 00:08:00 I call after him, and part of me was so, \"I shouldn't be calling after him. If he doesn't show up, he's going to need to pay for the appointment and I'm not going to do it, because this is the classic me chasing after him.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">So I called. [laughs] He's like, \"Oh, I just lost track of time. I'll be over in 15 or 20.\" So he shows up at 1:40. So he's 40 minutes late. We were on time for the appointment, we were even a few minutes early. Traffic was good. We were lucky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">But I was so-for whatever reason, it tipped the scale in the moment for me, because I shouldn't have to be doing this. You wanted to be an hour early. Instead, you were almost an hour late. Is this important or not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">And he always uses the, \"Time got away from me,\" or, \"I lost track.\" Mmm. It's not exactly-so if you need to set an alarm if you're doing whatever and you're-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: He's not a child anymore. He can figure a way around that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Right!  Literally set your phone to go off and there's nothing wrong with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">So I was really upset, and then at one point, I said, \"Let's just start over and pretend like it didn't-just let it go and move on if we're going to do this session.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">And so we did. And then afterwards, he came home. He ran to the store for a couple ingredients. He wanted to make-and he's like, \"I've got dinner.\" And I said, \"I can help.\" \"No, I got it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">So he made a really nice dinner. He got some roses at the store. He set the table, he put out a candle-I mean, this is huge for Ivan huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">We had a really, really nice dinner. And we watched some TV afterwards. And we just sat together. And we talked some, and it was good. It was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">The only thing is, at a certain point, I started saying, \"Oh, you know, it's getting close to 10:00.  I think you should probably get going. It's getting late.\" [He's like] (ph), \"Well, I was thinking I could stay a little later,\" and... [sighs] I don't know-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: He said, \"I was thinking I could stay a little later\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Is that how he said it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, something, like, \"I was thinking\"-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: As a statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, which maybe he-yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Very different than, \"Well, how would it feel if I were to stay a little longer?\" What would that be like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I think part of him is so eager to jump into these positive things. I find myself reminding him... But it's good to have positive time and it's good to even have conversations where we don't go near all the issues, that's probably important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">But I think, if we're meeting twice a week, part of those meetings need to be about what's going on. Because I don't want, in a few months, to say, \"Oh, well, we made some progress, now let's talk about those problems.\"  The delayed, it's too much for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: And I think it will become artificial for you, this sort of...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: ...if you start just only pretending things are just totally fine, that's actually not true...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: ...and that you won't want to kiss him anymore. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: That kind of intimacy was growing out of it being addressed in a real way...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: ...really being in the issues together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: So there wasn't any-so I think that was hard for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">So Tuesday night he went to hug me, which I said was fine, he asked about that. But then he kissed my neck, and he's like, \"Oh, maybe I should have asked about that.\" And I said, \"Ivan, I'm starting to notice you're doing some things and immediately after, you're feigning, like, 'Should have asked about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">that,' and that's not okay.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">I'm not sure he appreciates so much the act itself might not be a huge deal, but the importance of asking and getting permission and that that's really... I don't trust him.  And these huge things leave me feeling different about it. And this week, I feel different than I did last week about it, even. [sighs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">I let him borrow the car, because I said, \"It is getting late.\" He needed to open, so he needed to be at work at 4:30 in the morning. I said, \"Okay, you can borrow the car,\" which he hadn't done since he moved out, because it's my car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">And I said, \"If you want,\" he-he hasn't had a haircut in months, either, from me, and that's kind of different. So I said, \"If you want to borrow it, you can do to that, as well. I won't be home until the evening.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">So anyway, he let me know when he-I stayed at the hospital late, volunteering, so I didn't get until after 7:00. He said, \"I'll pick you at the subway (ph). I still have the car, I was going to drop it off, I'll pick you up at the subway (ph).\" And I said, \"You don't have to.\" So he volunteered to pick <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">me up at the subway (ph). And he asked, \"Did you ever get lunch or dinner?  Are you hungry?\" And I said, \"No, but just focus on getting your-get your haircut, just focus on yourself.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">So he showed up. He picked me up at the subway (ph). He was already waiting for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: With a haircut?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: With a haircut. [laughs] But also he picked up subs. He picked up dinner, because he knew I was hungry and it was getting late. So that was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Thinking about you (crosstalk at 00:13:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: ...really nice. This was really, really nice, really thoughtful. He wouldn't have had to do that. Even if had said, \"Let's go back to the apartment and I'll put together leftovers or something,\" that was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:13:34)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: That was all great. And then we did the same thing, kind of. We ate at the table. We spent time talking. And then we watched an episode of a TV show. And then it was getting towards 10:00 again and I'm like, \"Ivan, I think you should go,\" and again, \"Thinking I could stay a little later.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">He doesn't want to leave.  It is weird. It is weird, but... Then I started about a little bit an element that Dr. Farrow had brought into the conversation, something that I had sort of asked about before, which was... Ivan claims that looking at these websites and even his Life After Ramona [laughs] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">Google documents folder, his list of what he's looking for in a woman, she's like, \"Even if they're all fantasy, at some point, part of you knew that none of those things were ever going to connect you to your wife. Even if that was part of the motivating feeling,\" and that that bothered me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">And I said I wanted to talk about that and I have questions. It got very frustrating, because at this point, I want Ivan to be brutally honest. And I don't think anything is going to-I mean, it might get worse, but I think whatever it is, I just want to know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You would rather know what's really going on inside him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Right. So, I mean, if the-I mean, if he's painting it in this favorable light of, \"Oh, I really want this for my wife\"? It sounds different. It's hard, because even with-something that bothers me even maybe more than the profiles is the list he made of what he was looking for in a woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">And he's like, \"I was really angry when I wrote that. I was really frustrated.\" And there were things that he pointedly-the way he wrote it, it was the opposite of me, like something he was attacking about me personally. \"Someone who doesn't have crippling daddy issues,\" was one of the things that he wrote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">And I'm like, \"Do you really think that [laughs] about me? Clearly [laughs] I had a difficult relationship with my dad, but do you really... After all the work I've done and after all the-do you really think that about me?\"  He's like, \"I was so angry. I was so...\" [sighs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I think, in some ways, another way of putting what you're trying to say is that, \"Okay, he's angry,\" and, \"Okay, in some ways these are fantasies we're talking about.\" Okay, maybe he wasn't actually going to go do any of these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">But there still is an action that's actually happening in him making the list. Do you see what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Right! No, there is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: [So that] (ph) he actually doing something. He's not doing the even-louder thing, but doing something in making lists. And he's doing something in signing on that is important to you to understand, because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: It is!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: ...it's actually very different than not doing those things. A lot of people feel furious at their spouse and don't go make a list of all the things they'd want in someone else, that specifically is scathing criticism of their spouse. A lot of people would not do that when they're very, very <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">angry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: And I do think there's even a difference from having the thought being an enraged, \"Boy, she has crippling...\" thinking that and sitting down and typing it. Even sitting down and write it on a piece of paper and throwing it away, getting rid of the anger? That's even different, maybe. But this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">is, like, 75 qualities...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:17:21) file.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: ...that he wrote. And some of it was the opposite. And some of them were qualities that I have, very clearly still about me. And some of them were things that even he was angry about things about me were 5'3\" to 5'9\" I can never be that tall. And when I point those out to-whatever reason, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">that height thing bothers me more than maybe any of the others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">And when I point that out to him, he says, \"Well, in my mind, I was thinking I wouldn't want someone who reminded me of you. In my mind I was thinking I already lost you.  He's never going to have anyone else, but I don't want someone who would remind me of you.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">And I said, \"Then you were thinking about what you were looking for. Part of you had that fantasy, even if you were never going to act on it. Even if, say, we...\" [sighs] And he says, \"I was never thinking about what I was looking for in someone else. I was never looking for someone else.\" And I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">\"How does that go together? You write down a certain criterion that I could never-it's not something you're mad at me about. You don't want to be reminded in a future person, and yet you say, 'The thought about a future person never crossed my mind.'\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">So I don't know if the thought about a future person never crossed his mind in, \"I'm serious about this. This is something I would do,\" or if it crossed his mind in an abstract... It's very weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: One version of the abstract could be something-which is sort of both, in that sometimes people, if they're really angry at someone they love could have the fantasy of another person.  Not so much about the other person, but it's almost a form of getting back. It's a way of hurting the person <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">you really love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Which isn't (ph) right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Which means it's actually still about you. It's not about-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Which is what a lot of that seems to be. Even, he wrote, \"Someone who doesn't think that a group of 12 people for dinner is a big dinner.\" Because his family, when they have a small get-together, that's at least a dozen people. Sometimes, that's been overwhelming for me. But I've gone to all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">the family events that's he's-for years!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">And so, I mean even, \"Someone who has had five or less sexual partners.\" Why is that? \"Because I didn't think I could ever find someone else who waited until marriage.\" He's saying these things, and I'm like, \"So you're not thinking about someone else ever, and yet there are these things that-\" They're <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">not criticisms of me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's not a criticism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: They're not positives of me. They're just things that would never... That didn't bother him about me, but that I also could never be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">So I'm like, \"Where does that come from? And I got so frustrated with him, because I felt like he kept saying, \"I was never looking for someone else. I entitled it Introspection.\" He's like, \"It was a tool to show me that I was being an idiot and that I didn't want anything else.\" And I think that's really extreme.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: It's just hard to buy. And that's the part of you that's going, like, \"Really? That doesn't sound like what's happening.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: All the stories around the-they're all pretty extreme, and yet, Dr. Bourd seems to buy it, in that this is consistent. His escapist, it's very, very bizarre. But maybe it's legitimate. Not that it's okay but that this is actually happening to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">It's really hard for me, at that point, because I'm not trying to [laughs] find an explanation that is particularly damning.  I'm not trying to find one that paints him as this wonderful, devoted husband who had a lapse of judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">But I really want to know what's going on. And it feels like either he doesn't know, or he's really reluctant to come clean, because he doesn't have to, at this point. I mean, no one's ever going to know what went through his mind when he wrote that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">But so I guess the point of the story was I got really, really upset, because he was facing me and talking to me and looking at me, which is huge for Ivan. And using his normal voice. He wasn't moping and the whole-which I can't [laugh] it's critical of me, but I can't deal with it anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no. I don't blame (ph) you. I know what you're talking about it. It's not having a two-person conversation with someone, (crosstalk at 00:21:49).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Right. And I guess, especially given the fact that he-I always hated that he became the victim. He became the person who could barely get words out. Who could only look at the floor. And it's like, \"Wait a minute!  [laughs] I'm not beating you up! You did this!\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">So it was great that he was talking to me and looking at-this was good, but then there came a point when I kept-when I wouldn't let that thread go. I really wanted to know, \"How do you make a list of what you're looking for in a person without ever even thinking what you're looking for in a person? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">How do you look at naked women and say, 'I never thought about those women'? I only thought about you.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">There's a part of me that thinks that that's not all true, maybe. And I don't know. And I don't know. But I guess the point he wouldn't-there came a point where he just wouldn't answer anymore. Started staring at the floor, totally shut down. And I got so frustrated, I said, \"Then just go.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">And the worst part is he picked up his shoes and walked out the door. And that was it. And didn't call and didn't-and didn't nothing. And I thought...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">And I even said to him, \"Then we don't need to talk anymore.\"  I got so angry, because I thought, \"Wait a minute. I'm giving you these chances and we are (inaudible at 00:23:07). Things were going well-ish [laughs] as well as they could be and no. I can't accept that you're going to shut down and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">not answer and we're going to go back to this. Because I can't do that anymore.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What it sounds like would be helpful is if he... Here's what I think, backing up for a second, this is what I'm trying to say. I don't think Ivan yet understand what he was doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">So I don't think he's in a place where he knows the answer but he's hiding it from you. I think he's still trying to understand it himself. He doesn't get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">So I don't know that he's going to be able to come up with an explanation. It's not a matter of, \"Okay, if I really tell her the real answer.\" I don't think he gets it yet about himself. It takes sometimes people five years to figure out their stuff in therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">So but what he doesn't yet have in his repertoire which I think would feel very different for you is if he said, \"Ramona. I think you're asking me questions about things that I just don't actually know the honest answer.  And maybe I'm trying to tell you something that I wish it is, but maybe that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">not true. So can we table it? Because I don't want to tell you some things that are not true. Give me some more time to work on this, and we'll talk about another piece of it some more.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">That would feel different, right? That's not a kind of shutting down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess in some form of fairness he has told that he and Dr. Bourd are trying to work through it and figure out exactly what's going on and that he, in his words, \"Dr. Bourd is very dedicated, very persistent about finding out what's going with it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">[sighs] So I think, on some level, he's aware. It's hard for me, because even if Ivan said to me, \"Yeah, I mean, of course, when I saw those pictures and stuff, I thought about it even if it was only brief. Of course I thought about it.\"  But he's even telling me the YouTube videos, he says, \"Oh, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">started out looking for how to give a massage. And then it led to this. And then it led to that. And then it led to... And then I did click on it. I didn't watch the whole thing, but...\" And it's always this really innocent, really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">And of course I would love to believe that! Of course I would to-but I don't know if Ivan realizes...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Or even, Ramona, let's say for a second that's even true. It still doesn't explain. Another person might stop continuing to click at a certain point, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">THERAPIST: And he didn't. That's still what he has to understand. What was he going after? What is he looking for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">I actually think and this is why I say to you that the only part that's yours in that conversation is how, yourself, to try to bear more of the uncertainty for a little while. Because I just think if we come up with an explanation right now, it's going to be a fake one, no matter what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: He just doesn't know enough about it yet. I don't think Dr. Bourd knows enough about it yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">So I don't think there's going to be any explanation. I even think if he says, \"Okay, Ramona, I'll admit to you, it was all about that other woman. I was fantasizing about having an affair. I was fantasizing (inaudible at 00:26:15) divorce.\" I actually think that would be a lie. That's too clean. That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">actually not what's happening. When that's what's happening, it doesn't take this shape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">The list of things! People who are really wanting out of their marriage, that's not what happens. That's not the way it goes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: That's even (crosstalk at 00:26:33) bizarre, because I thought about it from my-could I feel that, because clearly, I guess, I feel like I have a lot of things to be angry with Ivan about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: But when I think about it, I think what I'm upset with Ivan about it or what I wish Ivan would change or what I wish... Or even I wish Ivan would work 9:00 to 5:00, like my friend Helen's boyfriend. I don't know. It's very weird. It's very bizarre.  And it sounds like a, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">I don't know if Ivan appreciates that even the thought of him looking at some women [laughs] doing yoga nude, that that's wrong and that bothers me on (inaudible at 00:27:17) level. But it doesn't really bother me in the way that the profiles and the list. And even them, in and of themselves, aren't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201211\">the-it's more like the thought process behind them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yep. The list, for example, there's very disturbed about it. That's what I'm trying to say. It's not even what people do if they're going to be going to have an affair. Or they totally want to get a divorce. It's just not the way it comes out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">You're trying to get it. What is that? What is this about him? You want to know, like, what are you in for? And is this going to change? What is this thing? That (ph) I think he just doesn't know yet. He's probably working on it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20124-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20124-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">What I guess I'm cautious about is it feels like pressuring him for the answer or telling yourself that's being too critical, to want an answer. Or that you shouldn't want an answer which isn't true, either! You're going to need an answer to that, ultimately, Ramona. I think you're going to need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201271\">get that and feel that it's moving and changing in a way that you trust in order for you to want to stay in this marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">CLIENT: That's the thing. I feel like I do need answers. But the other thing is, even him walking out that night, the next day, he's apologetic eventually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">And I get that. But I think I'm kind of at a point where it might not be fair. But clearly he's not changing overnight, even if there are lots of positive things happening which I hope there are, obviously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">If there was another betrayal on this level at all, a personal betrayal like that, I don't think I could take it. And I think, at this point, if I left? Right now, I feel like I don't-I wouldn't be leaving because he assaulted me. I wouldn't be leaving because he made the profiles. I would be leaving <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D1\">because he avoids. And that doesn't feel... I guess I don't feel like I have a real reason to leave, at this point. In my mind, I'm like... [sighs] At least with the work he's been doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">And it's so stupid, [laughs] I know this story will sound so stupid. But the other night Tuesday night while he was making dinner. Tuesday night was amazing. And something reminded me of this time when we were dating and... You know when you go to the movies and the popcorn is as expensive as the movie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh!

Ivan knows that I really like that. And we went to the movies pretty rarely. I mean, it's kind of expensive, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">There was a night we were going to do-we were going to watch a movie at home. We were going to watch a movie on our own. This is back while we were dating. And he went to a movie theater and bought popcorn and soda [laughs] and brought it for the-which was [laughs] so embarrassing. I mean, who's that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201351\">guy who walks in just to buy popcorn? But it was really sweet that he was-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: It's adorable!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: It was adorable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: I don't think that's stupid at all! I think that's (crosstalk at 00:30:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: And I thought about that. And I thought... You don't stay married to someone because they bought you popcorn one time. But there's definitely that side. And the side that made dinner and the side that showed up to pick me up from the subway and brought subs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: And that's really happening, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: It's hard. And here's the other... It's really, really bad timing, but I need to move, pretty much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: You do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: \"Need,\" I don't know if it's the appropriate word. But the point is, my lease is up October 27th. At which point, I can renew the lease and then if I leave at some point, I have to wait for them to re-rent (ph) the apartment. So that's not an option, given that it's definitely going to be a <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201451\">three-hour commute every day. That's kind of crazy. Since there are apartments that are comparably priced that are a lot, a lot closer.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20144-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20144-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">So I even asked my dad, because I don't trust myself to be objective at this point, \"Is that...?\" He's like, \"Well, that's maybe a no-brainer, if you can get a similar apartment, similar money, a lot closer. That's a wise decision.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">But the point is, that would put me on a month-to-month, which is over $300 more a month. So it would behoove me to move sooner than later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">THERAPIST: You're saying if you stayed, it would be month-to-month...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">THERAPIST: ...just trying to figure out what to do next. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">CLIENT: So starting November, it's going to be a huge, huge increase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">THERAPIST: And where you're looking to moving, are you imagining a studio, one-bedroom, with roommates...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">CLIENT: So that's the thing. That's the thing. Ivan and I are still separated, obviously, and we, I think, need to stay that way for two, three months, at least. And even that feels a little scary, because I want to believe that he's going to redouble his efforts and all this good stuff will continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201591\">and I will get more answers and I want to believe that. So I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">But that's the thing. I started looking at one-bedrooms, because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: If it's comparable...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Right. It is comparable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: ...if you could afford that, you might want that, either way. Is that right, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: It is comparable to what we have. We have a one-bedroom now a 600-square-foot one-bedroom. It's kind of small.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">That's the thing. I could technically afford it, once I start working, but it would be much more ideal, much more affordable, if it was for the two of us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">So I guess I'm looking with (inaudible at 00:33:06) in mind that he would be moving in. It feels scary, because I don't even want to say, \"I'm going to be moving on this date and I'm counting on you moving in and picking up half the rent,\" because then I have this secret worry that he's going to put <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201671\">his best foot forward for that amount of time, knowing that that's what we're working towards. And what if that's just because of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You don't sound like you're actually convinced, Ramona, right now, that that is exactly what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: So we've had three weeks in which he is pretty consistently aside from the couples' put in a lot of effort. He's been really working with Dr. Bourd, is setting up appointments-lots of good things. He's reading these books. He's showing up. He's making efforts. This is good. I think I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">to see that over and over and over.  And I think we would need to get to it seeing each other more than twice a week before I say...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Move in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">THERAPIST: And you need to build up more trust that you consistently see that over a long period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">So it's dangerous, maybe, to go in thinking, \"Okay. I'm renting this place because I'm assuming he's going to move in.\" I wonder if you could try to say to yourself, \"I need to rent a place and know that there is a chance that I'm going to have to pay for it by myself for a year.\" And that if that happens, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201731\">it happens. And it might be tight in your budget. And then if you know at the end of the year you're not getting back together, you could move to a different place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">THERAPIST: Right? In other words, not [bite off] (ph) something that absolutely isn't manageable...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20176-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20176-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">THERAPIST: ...on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D\">CLIENT: It would be. It just would be tight. And I'm hoping to pay off as much of my loans as I can. An $1,800 apartment is doable for two people. It's tight for somebody in my shoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Of course. Could you look at a studio? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20181\">CLIENT: I could, but then there's no chance of him moving in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20183\">THERAPIST: No? [Not to a studio] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">CLIENT: I mean, there could be, but I think that would be really-I mean, [laughs] I guess I learned in a one-bedroom with two separate rooms, basically, that can be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">THERAPIST: Tight anyway, I know. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">CLIENT: Right! That can be snug, when your option is to be in the bedroom, or in the living room, dining room. [laughs] So I think no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">And the other thing, the studios aren't going to be that much less. So to pay, like, $1,700 or so for a studio seems silly when...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Makes a lot of sense (inaudible at 00:35:34).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">I think as long as the mind frame is, \"He might not move in,\" and just to be prepared amongst the possibilities. That you want to not feel like it's a way of sort of backing into this. (crosstalk at 00:35:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">CLIENT: Right, and I don't even want to find myself looking only for the positive and kind of putting on blinders. Because really [need him] (ph) to move in. Really need to get this apartment squared away. [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">I told my mom what was going on, and she said, \"Well, you're not looking towards a permanent separation.\" She said, \"So I think you would be thinking about, eventually, him moving back in.\" Which makes sense. But then she's like, \"Well, then I think you need to take him to see the apartments,\" which <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201931\">seems fair if he's moving in three months, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20195\">THERAPIST: I don't agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20197\">CLIENT: [laughs] It's okay to-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20199\">THERAPIST: I don't agree. Right now, you are separated. And he needs to earn his way back into your life. If he doesn't like the apartment, he can deal for a year if it means you're getting back together. That seems like a-the message it sends by having him look at the apartment with you and have a <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201991\">choice in it really puts the message you're trying to deliver to him, really compromises it. For what, so he can like the apartment a little bit more? I'm sure you're going to pick a decent apartment, Ramona.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019B\">CLIENT: Okay. That's the thing, because I don't want to, on one hand, saying, \"Actually, if these certain things don't happen, forget about it.\"  Or even, \"I'm not going to couples' with you if these things aren't happening.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D\">And on the other hand, saying, \"But I'm sure everything is going to be squared away in two or three months, so I really want you to like this place.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly. Your mom's saying, \"Well, you're not having a permanent separation.\" I think we don't know that yet, Ramona. So I would not say that statement definitively right now. If you're saying that statement definitively, it means you are doing the thing that you've asked me to help <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F1\">you not do. You don't know. Is this going to be a permanent separation or are you going to get back together soon? You don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A1\">CLIENT: I feel like I don't know know. But I guess three weeks is, like I said, it's such a short amount of time. But I feel like if that continued and even redoubled, then I would feel clearly that we were moving towards resolving.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561772\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yep. It would be huge. That's what you're hoping, is that continues, because that would be enough for you, I hear you saying.  He's making enough changes that you'd absolutely want him back in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">So the scale's tipping like this right now. But what we don't want to have happen is as it tips, do you then forget about this? And what if there is still some secret betrayal that you don't know anything about right now? That you're going to find out about three months from now? I'm hoping that doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A51\">happen, too, [laughs] of course! Or what if, in two weeks' time, all of this starts to fall off again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A7\">You don't want to ignore the data that is going like this. That's really real. And yet, the things that were meant that you separated to begin with are really real and important, too, to not be forgotten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB\">THERAPIST: So hopefully it goes to this! And the decision's made. But you're just trying to keep, I think, keeping the, \"I don't know, so I'm going to proceed trying to keep both options open.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">I do think picking out a place, it's like the-it's not that much skin off his back if he doesn't like the kitchen or something.  You guys will move in a year. If you're happy, blissfully married at that point, great. You'll get a kitchen that he likes. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF\">CLIENT: It's a ridiculous question, but then do I put his name on the application? Do I put...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B1\">THERAPIST: It's not a ridiculous question, (crosstalk at 00:39:18).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B3\">CLIENT: I need to-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B7\">CLIENT: I wonder if I would even need-I don't know if my income would be enough. Somebody's who's only ever been in school, I don't know if my income would be enough. And the other thing is, I don't know if I can in three months in, \"By the way, my husband is moving in.\" So I wonder if I would put him <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201B71\">on and then... Take him off. Or if things didn't work out, or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Would he need to sign it, then? He would, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BB\">CLIENT: I think I could-I already saw the application, they already sent it to me for the one place. And I would need-whomever was the primary applicant needs to sign it. And they would probably check my credit and stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Okay. And not his?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BF\">CLIENT: Probably not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Because I'm wondering, is there a way of putting him and not having him know about it for the time being? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C3\">CLIENT: I don't know if I can-if I'm moving into a place, I don't know if I can say...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C5\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:40:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C7\">CLIENT: ...you can't move here.

Oh, you mean, you'd let him move in (crosstalk at 00:40:14).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CB\">CLIENT: No, no! No, not for months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF\">CLIENT: The very soonest I could think would be the beginning of December, which is maybe too soon. So no, not for a while. But eventually. His stuff is still at the apartment, [that would move] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What feels different is that he has to come to the appointment with you and you both are signing this? That feels a little bit too fast for that. But if there's way of, \"Okay, my husband is likely going to be here with me, too,\" but you get to do most of the application, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D11\">you're the one signing? That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D9\">THERAPIST: If you could do it without his income, do it.

That's part of my job is to help you stay on-task with that. And we'll do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E7\">Ramona, I also think-I don't know if you said to him what he said to you, in sort of naming, \"Ivan, I want to let you know that I see these changes and they seem,\" you've said that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Okay. Because I think that's huge. That goes a long way. I think, to the degree, that you would say, \"You know, next time we have this conversation, it would help me if you, instead of withdrawing, said, 'Ramona, I think I just don't know the answers to your questions,' and told me that with <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB1\">words, if that's what's happening inside you. Tell me that. Because that, I can work with.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201ED\">You can communicate some of those needs. It's a totally reasonable thing you're asking for and that's actually going to help him grow a repertoire. It sounds like when he starts feeling like, \"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I'm judging that person,\" he withdraws. And what he needs help doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201ED1\">is just saying, \"I just don't know. Can I get back to you on that one? I'll work on it and get back to you.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EF\">We have to stop.
