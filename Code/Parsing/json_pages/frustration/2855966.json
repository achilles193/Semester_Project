So what is the plan? I mean, how does it\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Her and Deborah have been up there since last week, since last Wednesday. Deborah is coming home Friday night, and Darla\u2019s staying there, and Deborah won\u2019t be able to go up there the following week because we have court on August \u2013 what week is Deborah \u2013 yeah, she\u2019ll be home that week because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">we have court on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the court for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: The restraining order I have against that lady.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: So unless somebody else decides to go up to Vermont, she\u2019ll get a ride with them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Who does she stay with when she\u2019s up there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Naomi, big house, big, big house, and she\u2019s company for Naomi, you know, and there\u2019s other people that come by and stuff. So, little (inaudible). Talked to me \u2013 was it Monday? It was Monday. \u201cCan you give JD $125.00, and he\u2019ll give you a bag of pot? That way Naomi can bring it up to Vermont? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">But make sure you wrap it up really good in case the patient gets pulled over by the police.\u201d He said, oh yeah, right, right. I said, \u201cDeborah, I don\u2019t have $125.00 to give the kid.\u201d  Then she called Annie, my next door neighbor, and asked her if she could borrow $75.00 from her mother. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200432\">how she was going to get that up to her. Annie said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have it. I asked her about it, she doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d You know? So she\u2019s a sneaky little devil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah. She needs it for\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Well her and Naomi smoke it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: How is Darla \u2013 are you worried about Darla getting by in terms of food?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: No, there\u2019s plenty of food up there. Naomi does all the cooking.  They\u2019ve got washing machine and dryer. They\u2019ve got the Internet now, if it goes on. They don\u2019t get that good of reception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Even though they got the big satellite and all that stuff. I said, oh, you need a bigger one. (laughter) So they\u2019ve been \u2013 they cleaned out Naomi\u2019s mother\u2019s house. Her and her two brothers own it, with all of the totes and stuff they had down there, and they brought their mom up to Vermont. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">Then they have storage up in Vermont, that they went there and brought a lot of furniture back, but there\u2019s still a lot of furniture and stuff inside it. Naomi\u2019s mother came by my house because Darla only went up there with two bras, so I had to send her up the other three that were in the house.  So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F2\">she came by and picked up the bag I had for her. I said, if I had known you were only going to be there for two days, I would have arranged to go up with you, and my next door neighbor, Frank, would watch the two cats. That was that. Needless to say, but they got no weed, because that kid never came <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F3\">by. Sometimes, I guess he doesn\u2019t mind covering it for Naomi.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855966\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Covering it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, and when she has the money, she\u2019ll give it to him, you know.

That didn\u2019t happen. (laughter) She\u2019s a nosy little bitch, my Deborah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Where do you stand right now with Deborah and what she\u2019s up to\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What do you \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what to think with that one. I like when Darla came up. I had given her $200.00 to buy clothes. She wound up paying for her mother\u2019s way to go to the movies. They went to the Providence and ate down at the Providence, so not only was it her plate.  She had to pay for her mother\u2019s. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">So no matter what, she\u2019s going to pay her mother\u2019s way. That $200.00 went nowhere on clothes. So I had given her another $200.00, and when she went up to Vermont, Naomi took her to Wal-Mart to buy more underwear, and socks, and t-shirts. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s got left for money. I want to call and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F2\">tell her don\u2019t \u2013 I keep telling her, don\u2019t give it to your mother, you know? And yes, Darla is smoking pot with her mother and Naomi. She\u2019s, \u201cI can\u2019t help it. I like pot. I\u2019ve been smoking it for the last three years.\u201d I says, oh, okay.  So I says, I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Darla. Look at your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Well yeah. I was thinking, it\u2019s her way of being with her mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Right. She says, \u201cIt calms me down. I don\u2019t have any anxiety attacks when I\u2019m on it.\u201d I say, but yet you don\u2019t want to go to the doctors because you don\u2019t want to get a tranquilizer, because you don\u2019t want to go on pills? Is that what I hear? \u201cYeah.\u201d Oh, you don\u2019t think marijuana\u2019s a drug, Darla? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">I say, Darla, you\u2019ve got a brain. Use it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: It seems to me like some of this that Darla\u2019s up to is related to her getting more in contact again with her mom, and you know, her mom\u2019s life is about pot, is about marijuana. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really \u2013 in some way that\u2019s her way of relating, even maybe when she\u2019s in Georgia, feeling somewhat connected with mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I says okay. I says, when I decide to give you more money, I understand you don\u2019t like going into the store and buying things because you get anxious, and the anxiety all over you and everything, so what we\u2019ll do, Darla, is we\u2019ll (inaudible). That\u2019s the only thing I can do for you. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">what you like, so I can\u2019t go to the store and pick up something, and go, oh, Darla will like this.

I said Darla, look. You\u2019ve got a double chin now. Before you were a lot thinner, Darla, you had no double chin, but you know, you\u2019re getting ahead there. You got the double chin like your mother because all you do is eat junk food a nighttime just like your mother. I said, the two of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">you make a pair. And boy, can that kid sleep too.  I thought she could take a nap in the afternoon, take a nap before bedtime, get up and eat something, go right back to bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: So as I said, she\u2019s not getting cash anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s got to use it for pot too, like mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: How are you feeling about her being up there then, in Vermont?

They\u2019re potheads from the moment they wake up, you know? So they\u2019ll go crazy to sleep without any pot.

She may stay four nights, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E71\">if she does stay the seven nights, I says, that\u2019s when I come home from the hospital. I was just in the hospital in June.

How would you like to come in and have a cup of coffee?\u201d No one. They\u2019re all afraid of her.

So the next day they got \u2013 she wanted something fixed in her apartment, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB1\">they send two maintenance men from now on to go in her apartment. One can\u2019t go, two, so that she can\u2019t say \u2013 I said, well then Janelle, she\u2019ll say she was gang raped, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED\">THERAPIST: How did Janelle respond?

It\u2019s only two steps, you know, but I missed the last step, down, half in the bathroom and half in the other room. I thought for sure I was going to need stitches.
