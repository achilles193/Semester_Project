Tell me what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m trying to back up. (PAUSE) Uh...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Do you want me to tell you the last thing I heard?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Okay. So I remember that you, you know, you and your wife had a talk and you kind of told her how unhappy you were, you know, and she felt pressured, you know, when you told her about the physical intimacy missing. You know, and I remember you guys were going to go to Indiana University to see...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay. And I remember she chose to drive with her friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Okay? And I think that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So I didn\u2019t tell you about going to Indiana University?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: No. Because I don\u2019t think you had gone yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Okay. So... Really? I thought that was the weekend before that. It doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: So Indiana University... My son is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh no. Okay. Yes. You told me that we has in a play and you felt like he was playing your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yes. I remember that. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Okay. Good. Yeah. So that Thursday... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I guess it was maybe that Sunday we went out to, we went to the show in Detroit and that\u2019s where...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: ...you know, we had that discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: At dinner. I remember that. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: So, yeah. That Thursday, I came home and it was just like... I was kind of in this place of not really sure what to do and I was like feeling all this anger and... (PAUSE) I really tried to put myself back there and I don\u2019t remember but it was just like, \u201cI just want to get out of here.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">So I went home and visited with my, or stayed with my brother and sister in law and, for Friday night. And then I made plans to go see my mom and dad on Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: So the brother and sister in law, I know... I\u2019m going to be shifting around. I\u2019ve got a pain in my hip here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to find a comfortable...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Do you need to put your foot up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I might. We\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You can move the furniture. Feel free...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT: So, at any rate, I went home to see them. (SIGH) I know that they had been doing their marriage counseling for about a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">CLIENT: And so we ended up talking for a while and my brother had to work on Saturday and he was tired. So he ended up going to bed a little bit earlier. But I stayed up until like one in the morning...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">CLIENT: ...talking with my sister in law. You know, and it\u2019s like just felt like we were, we really had a story to share...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D\">CLIENT: ...in terms of similarities that she had put the nuclear option on the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">CLIENT: And, as it turns out, all of us, my four brothers, or my three brothers and I... There are four of us. You know, we\u2019re all in exactly the same boat.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: We\u2019ve all thrown the nuclear option out the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Each of you around the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Tell me about that. That\u2019s pretty significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. It seems significant. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWell, maybe not all that significant considering we all came from the same house.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But that really emphasizes the house that you came from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. I mean, so there\u2019s a connection there. You know? So, at any rate, I felt like, you know, it was good to be able to feel like I was, you know, sharing that. You know, I felt like I had this significant moment of sharing with...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I mentioned that I... Peterson had recommended looking at Brene Brown (ph). She does work with shame and vulnerability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes, yes. That\u2019s right. Because you mentioned that to me because she did a TED Talk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: Yes. So, at any rate, I had kind of watched that and kind of felt this place of like... I was feeling some empowerment from just kind of like finding the people that you trust to be vulnerable with and kind of leaning into that. So, you know, it felt like that was good. Let them know that, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200891\">know, kind of where I was at. It\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go see, you know, marriage counseling. But...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Okay. This is a lot I\u2019ve missed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: Oh, it\u2019s a lot. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Okay. Can you tell me how this came about? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll keep going. I\u2019m just trying to go through it chronologically but... So... (PAUSE) Yeah. It was just in that place of like explaining where I\u2019m at. It\u2019s like, \u201cLook. I\u2019m going to go. But I know, you know, before the session\u2019s over, they\u2019re going to ask me the magic question.\u201d It\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200951\">\u201cHow much are you willing to put into this?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">It\u2019s like... In all honesty, if I\u2019m going to stand in my boots right now, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve got nothing. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m showing up with. You know? So I kind of did that talk with them and, you know, there were other things. I mean, my sister in law was able to kind of mirror some stuff back to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200971\">It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. You know, we\u2019ve kind of been noticing, you know, over the past six years, you know, things weren\u2019t good.\u201d You know... My nephew kind of asked her a question. So it\u2019s like, \u201cDo you think Seamus and Mary will stay married after the kids are gone? It seems like Mary and Ms. Curt are together <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200972\">all the time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Wow. What was that like to hear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just like, \u201cWow.\u201d So... I mean, there\u2019s that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: I went to talk to my folks to let them know that I was going to go do marriage counseling...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: ...because they\u2019re like, you know, the ultra conservative Christians. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWell, this is not going to go well.\u201d But they turned out to be like super supportive in terms of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s like, \u201cWe understand and, yeah, we kind of noticed some stuff too. But, you know, it\u2019s not our place to say anything.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s like, okay... So I was feeling kind of encouraged by all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Mary left with the band and the choir for like, like Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of this past week or...

So it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. Point well taken.\u201d Yeah, that probably wasn\u2019t the best way to do that. So, at any rate...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost as if though you\u2019re tired of keeping it secret.

Could be that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">CLIENT: I mean, there\u2019s another issue I\u2019d kind of like to discuss too. But Sunday night, you know, we had... Everybody was out of the house, you know, another opportunity to talk and, you know, I think I was able... Again, I don\u2019t remember the entire gist of the conversation. I think I can pull some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D31\">bullet points out of that. And I think that we\u2019re... I was able to get to, you know, and underscoring again for her... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">You know, after, you know, seven years of this experience, I feel like my emotional penny bank is empty. You know, the well is dry and I\u2019m starting from a place of like negative because there\u2019s just not a whole lot of trust left here. And, you know, that whole weekend, you know, she was like... (LAUGHTER) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D51\">For seven years, my experience has been like she\u2019s going to be gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">CLIENT: You know? One way or the other, there\u2019s something always on the go or she\u2019s with Lisa or whatever. But like she was home and it\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s all about me,\u201d and, \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d and, \u201cYou know, let\u2019s make...\u201d You know, it\u2019s just like... It just seemed so insincere after like so much of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D91\">the opposite experience to all the sudden have like all this syrupy sweet attention is just like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">THERAPIST: How did you feel about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">CLIENT: I was furious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I would imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: And so I was telling her that, you know, that I\u2019m having this, where I\u2019m at with these feelings. And she goes, \u201cWell, I\u2019m here to make a deposit.\u201d And I thought that it wasn\u2019t possible for like people\u2019s heads to explode. But I really felt something click at that moment. And I was just like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E11\">I really shut down after that. I was so angry. I stood up and I was like... I really felt like I was going to break something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Tell me about your anger in that moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was just like shaking, you know, kind of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: But tell me why. I think I get it. But tell me why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: (SIGH) It just felt so insincere. It felt so late. It felt like this is somebody who really doesn\u2019t understand the situation at all and this is not... This is just not fucking going to get any better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: You know, because I\u2019m just... You know, we are so far apart for this. And it\u2019s like I\u2019m not hearing... She\u2019s not hearing me. I\u2019m not hearing her. Whatever. And it\u2019s just like we\u2019re miles apart on this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Like a Band-Aid over a gunshot wound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what it felt like to me in that moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Sure. After it\u2019s already started to fester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. And you\u2019ve been left there for seven years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s my experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT: So... And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I just don\u2019t know what you need. I just don\u2019t know what you want.\u201d And the best I could say was like, \u201cI just need some space. I just need some space because all I\u2019ve got right now is anger and rage and that\u2019s the best that I can do. And that\u2019s the best that I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD1\">tell you.\u201d So she was gone for the next couples of days on this trip which was just, you know, (inaudible at 00:10:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT: You know, it gave me an opportunity to just kind of chill out. And it was Spring Break and, you know... (SIGH) But when she came back on Wednesday, you know, she texted me. \u201cSo, I\u2019m back in town. You know, do you need more space or do you need me to stay in town? Where should I, you know...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">I said, \u201cDo whatever makes you comfortable. But I just need you to know that if you\u2019re coming out here, I\u2019m going to be sleeping upstairs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">CLIENT: So she said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll stay in town for a couple more nights.\u201d And she did. You know, and then got home... I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) She called me, I think it was maybe, Saturday night. Peter was going to be home again. And, you know, she was in tears and it\u2019s like, you know... \u201cCan you just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201071\">can you please just stay in the room with me, you know, while Peter\u2019s home?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">THERAPIST: Because why do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">CLIENT: Because... You know, I think I get it. I mean, it\u2019s just like this, you know, being in this place is completely devastating. Her world view. You know? And it\u2019s like... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been up and down and I keep playing around with like what\u2019s going on. (PAUSE) Let\u2019s see. So what is today? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B1\">Saturday. We went... Oh, Sunday. Sunday was my son\u2019s senior recital down at Maroa. Okay. So, you know, I was upset of course, you know, that I had talked to a couple members of my family and the kids, you know... So she was upset about the fact that, you know... It was like, \u201cCould you have found a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B2\">better time to do this?\u201d It\u2019s like we\u2019ve got this senior recital this weekend and so, you know, she was feeling hurt and betrayed that I had talked to people. I can sort of get that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">But I\u2019m like... (SIGH) Whatever. It wasn\u2019t my intention to do that. It was just an intention to feel like I needed some support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">CLIENT: So we did this recital and it all went fairly well and everybody was pretty, I think, pretty normal except that, you know, it\u2019s like, there\u2019s, you know, the white elephant in the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: But whatever. And then we come back Sunday night and it was late and I just... You know, it was like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a deal out of this right now.\u201d So I went into our bedroom. But last night it was like I had made the decision that I was, you know, I was going to be in that place of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201151\">\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable doing this anymore.\u201d You know, it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Doing what anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Sleeping in this bed. It just feels like, you know, I\u2019ve been doing this for so many years. And it\u2019s like now that I\u2019m in this place of feeling, all I feel is tension and I\u2019m not sleeping well at night anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">And I\u2019m like... So, as it turns out, I didn\u2019t sleep well last night anyway. I went up to bed and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: So did you move upstairs then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: I just... Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: I just went... I didn\u2019t move everything upstairs. I just went to... We\u2019ve got extra beds upstairs. But, you know... I don\u2019t know. She got home. I don\u2019t know where she was at. I don\u2019t know. What was last night? Oh. I got home from class and she got home probably around a quarter to nine, texted <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">me from downstairs and said, you know, \u201cI\u2019m home. Going to bed. Too sad to talk.\u201d And I just texted back, \u201cOkay.\u201d I don\u2019t know what time it was. I had actually gone to bed. So I don\u2019t know. It could have been fifteen minutes. It could have been an hour. I don\u2019t know what time it was actually. But she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201232\">just came up and turned on the light and just like, you know, unleashed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: Okay. Tell me about what happened. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Why are you being so cruel?\u201d (SIGH) I\u2019m like... She\u2019s always been somebody who can like... The internal thinker. When it\u2019s on her mind, she can just say it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: And she can dump it out there. And for me, you know, especially when I get hit with a barrage of feelings like that, then it\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You know? Then it takes me a long time to put it all together, you know, as an external thinker to get it out there and all that stuff. So I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B1\">know. We were up until three-ish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: How did you respond to sort of her emotional barrage?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: I was really pretty amazing because I had spent some time over the last, whatever, week and a half just kind of thinking about all of that and thinking about, you know, how I believe, you know, that I have been, you know, for fifty years out of my life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">It\u2019s just that sense of like I gather my self-worth based upon whether or not people like me. It\u2019s all external stuff. You know? So the worst thing in the world is for somebody to be angry at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: You know, because you could snuff me out of existence by being angry at me. So I had really spent some time thinking about that, journaling about that, talking to some other people about that. You know, and getting a sense, you know, \u201cThis is how I\u2019ve operated all my life.\u201d Combine that with, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201351\">you know, my shame issues and combine that with a really bad skill set for communicating, you know... And it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, here it is. It\u2019s all come home to roost. This is the sum total and accumulation of like all of your really bad communication skills. So here you go.\u201d (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: So what happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Yes. How did you respond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">CLIENT: You know, I just kind of sat there with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">CLIENT: You know, and I just kind of sat there and it\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m just going to let her get this out.\u201d And what was really amazing, you know, is that I\u2019m not in this place of overwhelming fear. I\u2019m not in this place of like \u201cI\u2019m going to have to cave into everything that\u2019s being said <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201411\">here.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what? She\u2019s got a right to be really, really angry and pissed off and all of this kind of stuff because, yeah, it\u2019s her stuff. And I\u2019m good with that.\u201d You know? (SIGH) But, you know... (PAUSE) Yeah. You know, so it was helpful, you know, to a certain degree to kind of get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201412\">like, you know, to be able to get it from her. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re recognized.\u201d These are conversations, these are talks that should have happened twenty years ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20140-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20140-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: Sure. But she\u2019s emotionally responding to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And that\u2019s not... You guys have been emotionally not responding to one another and now you are. You know, something that you said. You know all of your bad communications skills. You know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad communicator. I think it hasn\u2019t been safe to communicate what you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201471\">needed to communicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: Okay. Well, whatever. I get that. I think that I get that. Enough other people have affirmed to me in being a fairly easy communicator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: When it comes to this relationship...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: ...it really, really sucks in a big way. And I get that. You know? And I get that, you know, there\u2019s a lot of issues going on. So as we were talking and as we were trying to like get things out, it\u2019s like, you know, I get the fact that, you know, she believes that in her mind that, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201511\">she was, she\u2019s giving me my space. You know, that it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t get you to communicate so I decided that I just needed to move on and move on with my life and just wait for you to decide to communicate or decide to start feeling again.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">So, you know, I get that we\u2019re doing to best that we can with the skills that we had. It just didn\u2019t work out real well. You know? You know, so a lot of old past hurts came bubbling up and, you know, thrown around and things like that. So... (PAUSE) Yeah. You know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: How did you guys get to the point where you decided to go for couple\u2019s counseling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: Oh, we had made that decision earlier in the week.

You know, you shouldn\u2019t destroy peoples\u2019 worlds like this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">THERAPIST: How do you feel about what she said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">CLIENT: Well, there\u2019s truth to it. But I also feel like... I mean, deep down underneath all of this, it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. You know what? There\u2019s a world here that needs to be destroyed.\u201d In my opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2016E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: Do you think... Well, do you feel that way, that kind of counseling or coming to counseling here has destroyed this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: No. It was destroyed long before I came here. You know, this is just fixing me to allow me to be able to communicate and to feel. The fact of the matter is I don\u2019t have a whole lot of skill set for that so maybe I didn\u2019t do this gracefully. Maybe I didn\u2019t do this as well as it needed to be done. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201771\">But, you know what? It\u2019s out there now. You know, so it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve got to deal with that.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: Well, you know... I can see her perspective where before coming to counseling you were... You guys had this status quo pattern. Now all of this was bubbling up underneath it and it sounds like she had some denial around what was happening around the relationship. But it worked. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: And then it didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: Because a lot of people... You know, what we had was really wonderful and a lot of people would really, you know, give a lot to have what we had. And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah. We had some good stuff here. But, you know...\u201d (PAUSE) From my chair...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: But it wasn\u2019t good for you. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: From my chair, this was a lot of years of really sucking a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: You know? And not being able to really own that or feel that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: You know? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: You know, I fluctuate from being deeply sad for the situation you\u2019re in because it\u2019s such a painful thing to deal with and amazingly proud of you because, in such a short amount of time, you went from being paralyzed, you know, fearful about saying what\u2019s real for you and not wanting to experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D1\">your anger to putting it out there in a way that... You know, it\u2019s almost like you just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. You just couldn\u2019t take the denial anymore... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">And so, in some ways... So, for her, I see she sees her world as destroyed. But the world was based on water because of all these things underneath it you\u2019re the one who was being... It worked for her. It never really worked for you, not for at least seven years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that we got... (SIGH) We got to this place of like, you know... I felt like we kind of circled around to another place that was really familiar to me in my past relationship which was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: ...you know, that when we would occasionally have these moments where we would have these disagreements or arguments or even... But, you know, these moments of conflict, it was always feeling like the situation got manipulated around so that it became all my deal. It was all my work that needed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201951\">to be fixed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">You know? And if you could just figure out how to line up your world...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">THERAPIST: And fix you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: ...the way that I want it to be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: ...then everything\u2019s going to be great. You know, and I feel like the piece that\u2019s missing in that formula now is that I\u2019m less inclined to believe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: I\u2019m less inclined to believe that I need to gain my self-worth from jumping through that hoop. So I was able to like, \u201cYeah, you know what? Something doesn\u2019t feel right here to me.\u201d And I was able to say to her sort of, \u201cYeah. But you know what... I\u2019ll take 50% of this but this is not... I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A31\">we\u2019re still not dealing with the 800 pound gorilla.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: You know, which is the sexual abuse issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Right.

It was abuse and abusive. We wouldn\u2019t define it was childhood sexual abuse. But what difference does it makes? It was abusive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, what I think she points to is being her sexual abuse episode was her brother.

You know, I feel that, you know, that kind of the loss of innocence and, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">So sex has been a bad thing for her...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: ...ever since then.

And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about here is I\u2019m talking about intimacy. I\u2019m talking about the fact that we don\u2019t have intimacy physical or emotional...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: \u201c...and it\u2019s all related to this issue. We need to deal with this issue because none of this is going to happen until we do.\u201d And it took like two or three times and I\u2019m still not sure if she...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Because she\u2019s terrified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: Oh, she\u2019s terrified. And then, you know, she\u2019s... Whenever the really intense anger comes up, it\u2019s all around that sexual abuse issue. She is so resistant to this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Sure. But, you know, I guess, you know, in hearing your response and hers, I guess, you know, if I could provide you with some protective mechanisms, and I don\u2019t know if I can, this is not about her or you. It\u2019s about the both of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: So, you know, when this sexual abuse issue comes up and comes out more and more, you know, it\u2019s tempting to say, \u201cWell...\u201d It\u2019s tempting in some ways to deny your own needs, I think and to focus on the sexual abuse because, you know, \u201cHow could you possibly want these things from me? Look. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB1\">I\u2019ve been sexually abused. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d And you\u2019re not talking about that.

And you want me to give you an answer right now tonight? Do you want this to work out? And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m telling you what I got. And what I got is nothing.\u201d So it makes me feel like, you know, I get to be that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202291\">guy then. I get to confirm all of her worst fears and I get to... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B\">THERAPIST: Okay. That\u2019s right. So let\u2019s stop for a second. You know, that\u2019s my fear for you that you inherit that and that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s never ever that simple. Right? You are not that guy. Right? That guy would\u2019ve had multiple affairs, left, done many things... You\u2019re not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B1\">guy. You\u2019re not happy and you\u2019re no longer willing to put up with a relationship, a marriage with getting any of your needs met in intimacy. But that doesn\u2019t make you that guy. And so, you know, as you have worked incredibly hard to find your truth and you have found it, as painful as it is, in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B2\">counseling with her, in your discussions with her, you have to stand in your own truth. Right? You know, I think I told you when I was thirteen, my parents separated, right? And I was old enough to kind of understand some of it but not all of it because as a kid I\u2019m watching these things unfold. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B3\">I saw how very painful it was for them both. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2022A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">I probably as a kid took my dad\u2019s side. I was kind of a Daddy\u2019s girl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">THERAPIST: I was pissed at my mom for years. But... And as a grown up, I began to see things differently that these were two really good people. They loved each other. I don\u2019t think they liked each other much anymore although, you know, they managed to figure their shit out later after their parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202311\">started dying off, after they were separated. They were always separated. They strangely became good friends. Right? But I began to realize that, you know, they were both correct from their point of view. And something wasn\u2019t working for them anymore. Right? And there were times I think when my mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202312\">really wanted it to work and there were times I think when my dad really wanted it to work not really at the same time. Right? And I remember it being a painful experience and both of them talking about it being a painful experience. But, you know... And she was really angry at him. But he was not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202313\">guy. He really wasn\u2019t. He could act like an asshole or she could act like an asshole. But they weren\u2019t assholes. It just didn\u2019t work anymore for them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">You know? And this is not working for you. This hasn\u2019t worked for you in a really long time and it hasn\u2019t worked for you in some extremely damaging and painful ways. That doesn\u2019t make you that guy. It just makes the truth that it\u2019s not working for you. That\u2019s the truth, no more, no less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">THERAPIST: And you have a diminished ability after sort of like swallowing shit for years and years and going, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this anymore. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Right? But that doesn\u2019t make you that guy. No matter how positioned into that role you will be pressured to feel, that doesn\u2019t make you that guy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202371\">It doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t make you perfect.

You know, I think the other thing that I\u2019m, you know, feeling, you know, is that, you know, she knows how to throw, you know, she knows how to throw the old stuff back out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s like...

She\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, I kept encouraging you to go get a job. You just wouldn\u2019t go do that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202411\">You ended up going to this, you know, this counseling thing.\u201d And it\u2019s just like all of these things that from her vantage point, the way that she\u2019s seeing it and the way she\u2019s throwing it out at me, is that, you know, I\u2019ve just been this narcissistic character that has just pursued whatever the hell <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202412\">it is that he wants to do. And, \u201cI\u2019ll just sit here and go to work and fund all of your narcissistic adventures.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20240-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20240-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20243\">And I\u2019m like, \u201cWow. That really hurts.\u201d You know, I get how you might see that or something from your point of view and it\u2019s like... It\u2019s difficult to look at the track record and not say, \u201cYeah. I guess I do change up my career, you know, quite a bit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20245\">THERAPIST: But let\u2019s hold on for a second. I think that\u2019s one way of looking at it. However, when you decided to stop teaching and open up your own business, was there a discussion about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20247\">CLIENT: (SIGH) Yeah, I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20249\">THERAPIST: Okay. And were there any sort of say, \u201cNo, hold on. I don\u2019t think you should do this,\u201d or, \u201cLet\u2019s not do this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Permanently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">THERAPIST: Like... Right. In the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like... You know, it was a scary adventure and it\u2019s like, \u201cDo you really want to do this,\u201d and, \u201cThis is really taking a step out and away from security and...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">THERAPIST: But was that message consistent? \u201cI really don\u2019t want you to do this.\u201d Or did it change?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">CLIENT: I think that she eventually just kind of gave in on the idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">THERAPIST: Okay. So, in some ways, if that is her perception... Right? So this is a communication both of you have where you may subtly state or state once or twice what you think or feel in disagreement with the other person and then let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">CLIENT: Probably once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Okay. But then are these... What happens is there are these fundamental... In some ways, she bears a responsibility for saying, \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with this. I don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d But that\u2019s not the message that you heard consistently. And the same thing for you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D1\">If something was happening... I mean, it didn\u2019t have to be a seven year...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">THERAPIST: So this is the... And this is not pointing the finger. But what I\u2019m trying to point out here is this is the agreed upon couple contract that you guys signed together about how we do things in this house with one another. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">THERAPIST: And how we do things in this house up to this point has been we don\u2019t really talk about the things that hurt us, that bother us. We just kind of go into separate corners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">THERAPIST: And then you changed contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">THERAPIST: Right? Because you couldn\u2019t stand the contract the way it was. But both of you, right, both of you absolutely agreed upon that contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">CLIENT: And I think I was able to say that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">CLIENT: ...in so many words last night. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou know, we have really, really poor communication skills. You know? And the reason we\u2019re here right now tonight is because we have 27 years of really bad communication skills.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t go there anymore.\u201d It\u2019s like whatever that was, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202731\">whatever that was, that\u2019s over now because I\u2019m changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">THERAPIST: How are you doing with all of the feelings this brings? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) You know, I... You know, it\u2019s difficult to manage, you know, because it\u2019s omnipresent and difficult to like focus. You know, it took me like two hours to get stupid little reflection question done that I had to submit online today. A smarter man would have figured out a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202771\">plan for doing this. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20279\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with intelligence.

It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027F\">CLIENT: I mean, this is all in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20281\">THERAPIST: It is. I mean, you completely changed the dynamic. Like since you guys had been following all the rules and now there are now rules. All the rules that you had are gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20283\">CLIENT: And I get it. You know?

It\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to stand back here and you...\u201d You know, the image I have is from a long damn time ago in our relationship. It\u2019s like there are these walls built up. And it\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you over this wall. Do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2028B1\">feel intimately close now?\u201d That\u2019s the kind of intimacy that we\u2019ve had in this relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ll stick my head out to see if it\u2019s safe for me to, you know, tell you how I\u2019m feeling.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20291\">THERAPIST: The first couple of sessions you described it as the force field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20293\">CLIENT: Same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20295\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20297\">CLIENT: So I get that, you know, I did the same damn thing. And which came first? I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20299\">THERAPIST: Well, it came together. That\u2019s the agreed upon contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B\">CLIENT: Right. I mean, yeah, we entered the relationship like that and we came with our own brokenness. So this is how we do this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029D\">THERAPIST: But that doesn\u2019t make you a bad guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029F\">CLIENT: Oh boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A1\">THERAPIST: That just makes you a guy that can\u2019t deal with this current situation the way it is anymore. Right? And I\u2019m going to say this again because in the moments where you feel guilt or shame or whatever, I would like you to remember that it doesn\u2019t make you a bad guy. And if you really focus within, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202A11\">in your truth, you know that this doesn\u2019t make you a bad guy. So whether this marriage continues or not or what happens next doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the one at fault or I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a fault. I just think that it, you know, things are not working and you\u2019re not willing to put up with it anymore. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202A12\">You know? And if you look to, you know, it is kind of remarkable that your brothers are at a similar place and maybe if you think existentially some of it is getting to a point in your life, you know, the kids are out of the house and you\u2019re reclaiming parts of your life for yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A3\">And you look back and you go, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want, you know, the next forty years to look like this. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A7\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A9\">CLIENT: And she does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AB\">THERAPIST: Well, sure because it works for her. She gets the social acceptable desirable position of being married, kids are out of the house, that\u2019s respectable. It\u2019s very Christian. Right? And yet her emotional intimacy needs get to be met and yours don\u2019t. Right? And, in some ways, I can understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202AB1\">her perspective. You\u2019ve destroyed this very nice little life that we\u2019ve had. But it\u2019s hell for you. It\u2019s been hell for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AD\">CLIENT: And it has been because I get that. And it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, has it really been hell?\u201d Well, why don\u2019t we look at the facts, pal. You know? I mean, not that I... I\u2019m just saying this... I shouldn\u2019t say this knowing my position as a counselor in training...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N202AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AF\">THERAPIST: You say whatever you want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B1\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t need you pressing any panic buttons.

Have you ever been to couples\u2019 counseling before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D9\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DB\">THERAPIST: Okay. It\u2019s emotionally intense. I hope that you have a good counselor and I think your honesty with where you are is probably one of the most important things. If you... You know, it\u2019s almost always the case that people are differentially motivated. But you continue to be honest. Right? You <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202DB1\">be honest with where you are. Where you are may change...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DF\">THERAPIST: ...depending on how things go. But I don\u2019t think you have to have expectations. I just think that you have to try to be open to the process, not even expect what it will bring or fix or heal or whatever. But just kind of... You know, you have so much more information now from your wife than <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202DF1\">you\u2019ve had in years about her emotional responses to things, some of which hurt you, some of which pissed you off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E1\">But you have emotional data. Right? And so counseling will bring more emotional data and then you will continue to kind of look at it and decide what you want to do with the rest of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E5\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s the expectation to have, that you\u2019re going to learn more and that information will be useful to you for decisions that you have to make. And I think that\u2019s all you really have to bring to the process. Show up, listen, state your truth...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E9\">THERAPIST: It looks like it\u2019s really wearing on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is. You know, and I get that. And it\u2019s... (PAUSE) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F1\">You know, and really, you know, there\u2019s a huge... It\u2019s who I am. You know? And it hurts inside to see her hurting. You know, and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to do that to anybody. You know? (PAUSE) There\u2019s also a part of me that\u2019s like... Whatever. You know? I can\u2019t take 100% responsibility...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F3\">THERAPIST: Absolutely not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F5\">CLIENT: ...for this. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N202F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F7\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a sad situation and... Yeah. Everybody\u2019s going to be feeling what they\u2019re going to be feeling about this. But I can only accept whatever I feel I\u2019m responsible for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FB\">THERAPIST: Sure. And recognize that, you know, if you have... I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s say you have 40% responsibility and she has 40% responsibility, there\u2019s 20% variability there still floating around, you know, of just factors. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FD\">I think it is pretty incredible that you reached out to your family for support. Well, I need to hear that because it feels like, you know, I\u2019m being some kind of a sneaky bastard who\u2019s trying to, you know, set up conditions for blood money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FF\">THERAPIST: Not really. You know, in terms of talking to your sons, that might have been a decision the two of you made together but your family, your siblings, your brothers. Right? You are allowed to have relationships with your family members and to reach out to them. You really are. You really don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202FF1\">have to ask anybody\u2019s permission to do that. And what you got back from your parents and from your brother and your sister in law was surprising probably for you because you had, in some ways, you know, everybody\u2019s kind of cut off from one another. But you needed that. You had gotten into a habit of <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202FF2\">not reaching out and when you did, you got a lot of rewards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20301\">CLIENT: I really did and I found it not just those family members...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20303\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20305\">CLIENT: ...but there\u2019s a half a dozen other friends...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20307\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20309\">CLIENT: ...that I\u2019ve had since a long time friends and it\u2019s like.... I had this small little, you know, group of support system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you didn\u2019t feel that way a couple months ago. We...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030D\">CLIENT: Probably not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030F\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20311\">CLIENT: And, you know, a couple of months ago it\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t tell you what I was feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20313\">THERAPIST: No. But you didn\u2019t feel like you had much support and you changed it by talking about what you\u2019re going through. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20315\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20317\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re changing these huge patterns... Maybe it\u2019s hard to see because you\u2019re in the middle of it and it\u2019s really painful. But you sort of had a lifetime of one pattern. You\u2019ve completely changed it in a couple of months. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20319\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, as much as I didn\u2019t want to be Wile E. Coyote hitting the plunger on the dynamite, that\u2019s pretty much what I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I pretty much just fucking blew it all up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031F\">THERAPIST: But you blew up the pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20321\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20323\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t blow up the marriage. Okay? You blew up the pattern that wasn\u2019t working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20325\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20327\">THERAPIST: Alright? Again, I don\u2019t want self-blame to creep in here but what it does is it really clouds understanding what\u2019s really happening. If you are just guilt ridden and shame ridden, you don\u2019t really, you\u2019re not really in a place then to really look at what\u2019s happening. Right? So I\u2019m imagining <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203271\">things as you go forward. I\u2019m imagining this is a pretty awful place to be. But it was a worse place to be where you were before and you won\u2019t stay here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20329\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I have no idea... You know, a buddy of mine who\u2019s... I call him my redneck alter ego.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20331\">CLIENT: If you can imagine everything that I\u2019m...

But you\u2019re not changing the truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2039D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2039F\">THERAPIST: You know, so, now, again, so when I say, you know, my goodness, you\u2019ve broken this pattern, you\u2019ve broken the shit out of the pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A3\">THERAPIST: Like, you know, it\u2019s like a glass plate that you just cracked the hell out of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not going back together again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A7\">THERAPIST: No. And you know what? Good. Because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A9\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203AB\">THERAPIST: I sort of liken it to having acid on your insides the other way where you\u2019re just slowly destroying yourself from the inside. Say again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203AD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203AF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what... Yeah. That\u2019s what I think of it as not being able to say how you feel and how you think and how you\u2019re dying inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203B1\">CLIENT: Swallowing all that poison for years. You know, it\u2019s like, you know... I think the one thing that was really difficult for me and I did call my daughter. It\u2019s like... She wasn\u2019t home so I called her and talked to her over the phone. She\u2019s the only one that really expresses any kind of emotion <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203B11\">out of all the people that I talk to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203B5\">CLIENT: I get it. You know, it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203B7\">THERAPIST: What happened there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203B9\">CLIENT: She was, she was sad...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203BD\">CLIENT: ...about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C1\">CLIENT: And then she called me another time. I think she and my wife had a discussion and she said, \u201cIt just feels like you\u2019re not going to try to put it back together Dad.\u201d You know? And so I get, you know, that I\u2019m changing up, I\u2019m rockin everybody\u2019s world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C3\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C5\">CLIENT: And that one\u2019s probably the hardest and it\u2019s just like, you know... I don\u2019t care who else is crying but my little princess cries and then it\u2019s like, \u201cOh shit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203C9\">CLIENT: But, you know, Mary is like, \u201cHow can you... How can you...\u201d Whatever she said, the word. I don\u2019t know. \u201c...break the hearts of our children,\u201d and all that kind of thing. And I\u2019m just feeling like continuing this crap and giving them that for how many more years, you know, it\u2019s like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203CB\">THERAPIST: But see even that is a very emotional blackmail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203CD\">CLIENT: Manipulative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203CF\">THERAPIST: \u201cBreak the hearts of our children.\u201d Well, your children are grown and it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re immune to this.\u201d Okay? But it means you will have conversations with your grown children and you will say what\u2019s true for you and you will acknowledge how difficult it is for the family. But are <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203CF1\">you breaking the hearts of your children? You know, I don\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N203CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561978\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D1\">CLIENT: Here\u2019s another thing. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay.\u201d I get that what she\u2019s saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D3\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure. It\u2019s definitely sad and they will have a reaction to that. But that\u2019s really... That\u2019s a finger point. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the hearts of our children.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D5\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D7\">THERAPIST: You know... And it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Like, I mean, I certainly don\u2019t speak for every child of divorce or separation but, you know, I had a really good relationship with both of my parents. And there were a rocky few years. I was a lot younger than your children. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N203D71\">my brother was probably college age, at the time, my older brother. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D9\">But, you know, my relationship with my parents stood the test of time individually because I had good individual relationships with them. And it was a very difficult thing for our family go through to watch your parents separate or split up. But my... Each of them attended to the relationship with each <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N203D91\">of us and there were three of us, each of them did. And I think that even though it\u2019s a painful time, you know, remember that you are a good dad and you are their dad and you are going to have conversations with them about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203DA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s just, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203DC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203DE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203DF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s throwing around that kind of, that emotional stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203E0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203E1\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203E2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203E3\">CLIENT: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203E4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203E5\">THERAPIST: And you know what? You are trying. You wouldn\u2019t agree to go to counseling if you weren\u2019t trying. So when you say, \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re not going to put it back together,\u201d that you don\u2019t know. But you know you\u2019re trying and trying today looks different than it would yesterday, looks different <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N203E51\">than it would tomorrow. Trying today may look like you only have negative two. Maybe tomorrow it\u2019s 10%. We don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203E7\">You don\u2019t know.

There is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203F3\">THERAPIST: But you are extraordinarily brave to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203F5\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s what some others have said and I\u2019m like... I need to hang onto that because... I mean, there\u2019s kind of like this dualistic list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203F9\">CLIENT: You know, it\u2019s like the things that I feel like I\u2019ve come to know about myself and the things that, you know, got thrown at me last night.

Right? But that\u2019s one perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20400\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20401\">CLIENT: Yeah. And these are perspectives too and it\u2019s like neither of them are really ultimately real. You know, it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20402\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20403\">THERAPIST: Well or they\u2019re a shared reality or, you know... If you, you know, if you feel like it or if something happens in couples\u2019 counseling and you want to check up with me, please do. Send me an e-mail and tell me to call you.

They weren\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N204131\">able to connect, emotional intimacy. This is not a unique experience to you. It is your experience. But it\u2019s a painful experience.
