What\u2019s happening for you at night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: (SIGH) You know, it\u2019s just like I\u2019ve been really tuned into by body and like the body is just like screaming at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s it saying to you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Well, it was interesting. I\u2019ll back up just a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: A friend (PAUSE) was talking about some gestalt stuff. And I\u2019ve been resistant to that kind of stuff. That whole notion of talking to the empty chair just drive me crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m like why would I be so resistant to something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: So... Like, I don\u2019t know. For whatever reason, like Sunday morning, I was just like (PAUSE) just sitting there and I started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: You know, and it was almost barely audible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, okay. It\u2019s not like thinking about talking to the empty chair. I have to talk to the empty chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like the more I did it, the louder my voice got.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: And I just started saying stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: What did you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: You know, like I was just directing it all at Mary and just trying, trying not to edit, just trying to get it all out. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">And I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOkay. Maybe this is what I need. This is what I need to do in order to get rid of this knotted up feeling in my stomach.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: What kinds of things did you say to the chair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: You know, I think, you know, anger feelings, hurt feelings, you know, how could you have done this to me kind of feelings. You know? And ultimately, you know, saying those really hard words of, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s just not any love there anymore and I just want out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: You know... And that\u2019s just like, just really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Gut wrenching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, \u201cHey, you know, maybe this is good. You know how to get this stuff out.\u201d The experience that I had of doing that it just like... It just knotted up that stomach even tighter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: And then I started to develop this like splitting headache.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m like, \u201cOh fuck.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">CLIENT: You know, so then Mary was coming home and she was home in the afternoon and I had to go down the road of like trying to fix some (PAUSE) financial mistakes in my Quickbooks program with the business that I\u2019m sort of transitioning out of. And I\u2019m just like such a zero when it comes to that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B1\">So I had to go revisit tapes of being the failed businessman. You know? So like carrying that around and then like really not wanting to talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: So like, \u201cLet\u2019s go try to see a movie.\u201d You know, there\u2019s nothing really. And so we\u2019re going to watch a movie. Well, the Internet\u2019s not working properly. So it\u2019s just like, \u201cOkay.\u201d And I\u2019m really just like... You know, the longer it\u2019s going on... I don\u2019t want to be too graphic. But you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">that feeling when you\u2019ve got to vomit and there\u2019s just nothing that\u2019s going to make it feel better unless you do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">So it\u2019s like, \u201cLook, I just need to get some stuff out.\u201d And I know that, you know... And she\u2019s... You know, she\u2019s not unaware that I\u2019m like physically in a really bad place. You know? And I\u2019m sure that probably on the outside it looked like someone who is going crazy. But it\u2019s just like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">got to get this stuff out.\u201d I just need to be heard. You know? So I launch into some of the stuff. And, again, you know, what\u2019s coming out? Not 100% sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: You know? It\u2019s like coming out. And I could sense that she was going to jump right in with, you know, being defensive about the stuff I\u2019m spitting out. And I was able to say, \u201cLook, you know, if you\u2019re not in a position to be able to hear this right now, I understand and I\u2019ll stop because I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">not in a place of arguing about this. I just need to get it all out. And if you can\u2019t hear it right now, I understand. But that\u2019s... If you\u2019re going to... If this is going to happen, I just need to get this stuff out. You know?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: What was that like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Again, it was kind of like the gestalt experience. It was kind of slow and I\u2019m not really sure how I\u2019m saying. It feels kind of awkward. But the more I was doing it, you know, I could just really feel just that sense of lightning. And it was like, \u201cI know that this is what I need to be doing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">I just need to be getting all of this crap out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I mean, you are really in the heart of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: (PAUSE) Yeah. So... (PAUSE) So I\u2019m just like trying to stay with that, trying to stay with, you know, is that really what you feel? Is this what you\u2019re... You know, it\u2019s like... So I think I was able to get, you know... It seemed like okay. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">This is probably all I\u2019m going to be able to do right now. Not that it\u2019s all said. You know? But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Because I couldn\u2019t go there. I couldn\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t love you anymore and I want out.\u201d You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: What was that like for you to say that to yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: (PAUSE) Well, it\u2019s truth. It\u2019s where I\u2019m at. I know it\u2019s truth. But it\u2019s just like... (PAUSE) Okay, for me to speak my truth, I have to go down to the place of watching somebody\u2019s life just crumble. (PAUSE) And, you know... After I was able to get my stuff out, you know... You know, it was kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B1\">of like I can tell, you know, that she\u2019s standing there. I recognize that, you know, when I\u2019m looking into her eyes, you know, all I see is the fear and I think that that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever seen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Tell me more about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: You know, recognizing that it\u2019s like... (SIGH) (PAUSE) I\u2019ve experienced other relationships.

You know, this is... You know, we\u2019ve got to march completely honest forward <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">in this. You know? Because whatever it was, that\u2019s over.

There\u2019s another one of the women from the faculty who I suppose probably is in on what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like at least half of the people at the table are like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It sounds like hell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m like, \u201cReally? Why are you wanting to do this? Why are you going to do this? What\u2019s...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Going to do what? Make you go to that... Have you at the dinner?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Why am I going to this dinner. You know, and I\u2019m like asking myself ahead of time. It\u2019s like there\u2019s nothing that feels like you want to be doing this. What the hell are you going this for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: You yourself or what Mary? Okay. Yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s me, inner conversation. So I\u2019m like... So I think ultimately I just decided, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to go.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m just going to try to stay with, just be aware of what\u2019s going on, you know, feeling wise. And it really was this hellish experience for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: I can imagine. Because it\u2019s a lie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s phony. It\u2019s fake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: The whole thing was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: You know, and I just was like... It took all of my skills, you know, to stay in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">CLIENT: And I recognized just the screaming and yelling that\u2019s going on inside. And it\u2019s like I know that the only way that I was able to get through those kind of things in the past is just to shut down. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">You know what? I recognize that it doesn\u2019t make any difference what relationship you\u2019re in. I mean, there are some things we go and we do because they\u2019re an obligation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: And you do it and you get through it and blah, blah, blah. You know? And not everything has to be, you know, that, you know, you always have to be in this place with me. \u201cWell, if I don\u2019t feel like doing it, I\u2019m not going to go do it.\u201d I think. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Right. Because that\u2019s not how relationships work. But it\u2019s interesting that you should bring up Gestalt because... And I don\u2019t know how much you know about Gestalt. Do... A little bit. Okay. There\u2019s a personality structure in Gestalt that talks about peeling back the layers. Right? The first <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB1\">one is I think the phony layer and the second one is the phobic layer. Right? You know, and you peel back... There\u2019s the implosive and the explosive... I can\u2019t remember all of them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">But then, you know, that\u2019s the whole purpose of gestalt therapy, to increase awareness. I actually showed a video of Fritz Perl (ph) last night in class. So it\u2019s interesting that this should come up today. You know, and he talks about body awareness and wholeness. But you peel back the layers and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD1\">you have the genuine authentic self which is something that\u2019s very hard to do and be. Right? And you\u2019re talking in so many words about peeling back the layers and not being able to take the phony, phobic layer. And I want to take you back a bit when you first came in and I asked you if you liked your <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD2\">wife. And that was a question that was so hard for you to look at. You kind of pushed it away and you kind of pushed back kind of not wanting to look at the anger. And you\u2019ve really moved really quickly to sort of not being able to tolerate any phoniness, fakeness, something that\u2019s not real for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that that\u2019s really... You know, it\u2019s got to be jarring for everybody around me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s jarring for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m just like... You know, I find that it\u2019s, it\u2019s affecting so much. You know, it\u2019s just affecting everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Tell me how it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: I mean I... You know, I\u2019ve not handled it well. (PAUSE) And I recognize that, you know, this whole process and all the turmoil that I\u2019m in right now is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m supposed to be doing this little five hour a week tuition waiver thing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: ...with one of the professors. And, you know, and I\u2019m like... I felt early on like I should have declined it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: A, because I\u2019m not sure I really had time to do it. And then, B, it\u2019s not something I give a shit about. (WHISPERING)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) And I\u2019m supposed to be doing research and I\u2019m supposed to be reading research articles and reviewing them and submitting reviews. And I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the hell I\u2019m reading.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: You know? And I\u2019m like... So, there\u2019s just this like, \u201cAh, I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d So I know subconsciously it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, this is my lowest priority.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">CLIENT: So what happens, you know... Well, I\u2019ve put it off for a couple of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: And then this shit hits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: And then it\u2019s like, you know... So... (SIGH) I recognize that, you know, in kind of retrospect, the first... Maybe me now would have been able to go in and say, \u201cYeah. You know what? I need to decline this because I can\u2019t do this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Right. But you couldn\u2019t at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: But, you know, this is as much a surprise to you as much as anybody else. This is the you that always was. I mean, this is... But, you know, when you say, you know, you\u2019re screwing up everybody\u2019s life and that kind of thing, I think you\u2019re going through a period of transition. And when one <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201111\">person, as you know, in a family changes, everybody has to change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">But is it screwing up someone else\u2019s life? Your wife would probably say yes. But I think there\u2019s a different interpretation of that because you were dying. Right? I remember actively thinking after some of our early sessions that, you know, what your potential was, you know, and the fact that I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201131\">felt so much for you because I saw you dying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Right? And not wanting to be emotionally dead anymore but sort of really struggling with not only admitting your own truth but what it means to who you say you are. Right? And I think that\u2019s the process that\u2019s being challenged here. Who you say you are you have always been this person. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">you haven\u2019t always felt safe enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Well, and somebody else reflected that back to me recently...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: ...very recently. And it\u2019s like, \u201cLook, you keep saying that you\u2019re an inauthentic person, that you\u2019ve lived an inauthentic life. It\u2019s like that\u2019s not true. You know? That...\u201d And I guess that I admit that when I think about this network of people that I\u2019ve kind of gone around and I\u2019ve set up, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D1\">you know, to kind of support me through this...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT: ...it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got authentic relationships with all of these people don\u2019t I?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just that for whatever reason, you know, and I\u2019m sure the list is long, I can\u2019t be authentic in this marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: Well, you are now. (PAUSE) And that\u2019s not... That\u2019s a combination of two people as well as a culture, a family culture, a couple culture. That\u2019s not just you. That was the agreed upon contract and when you changed the contract, everything has to change. But both of you for years agreed upon that contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: The problem is you want to renegotiate the terms of maybe you want to walk away from the contract altogether and that\u2019s what\u2019s different. And you know what? As sad and as painful... As excruciatingly painful as it is and what this means to your life and hers, you have a right to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">You do have a right to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: I think that that\u2019s probably where I\u2019m at right now. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not sure that I believe that I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: I mean, there\u2019s a cognitive part of me that, you know, like gets that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: And then there\u2019s the other part of me that\u2019s like, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: Tell me about the other part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s buying into her story. It\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ve sacrificed this and I\u2019ve done all I could. I\u2019ve tried to get you to feel. I\u2019ve tried to get you to talk and blah, blah, blah.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2013A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like wow.

But the bottom line is, you know, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to go to a movie with you tonight.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be having, to be sitting here looking into your eyes that are just about \u2018Are you going to leave me?\u2019\u201c You know, and knowing that there\u2019s all of this vitriol. There\u2019s all of this vitriol there. But I\u2019m willing to forgive all that if you\u2019ll just come back. You know, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201471\">uses the words and I\u2019m just like, \u201cThis is really insightful.\u201d And as she was saying it, it\u2019s just like, \u201cUgh...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: What words?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: She goes, \u201cI know... You know, what I hold onto is this kernel of you, you know, who this true part of you and who you are and I\u2019m just holding onto this kernel.

You just... Whatever that kernel was that you\u2019re hanging onto, I\u2019m not that guy five minutes after you hung onto that kernel.\u201d It\u2019s like I want to be known for who I am right now. I\u2019ve wanted to be known for who I am right now for a very long damn time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: Sure. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like... I get it. You know? \u201cI\u2019m not meeting that picture so you don\u2019t get anything.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: Well, you know, this is not a matter of rightness or wrongness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s the most frustrating part of it. So if you do say, yes, you\u2019re a selfish bastard, the... Now what? You know? We could look at it and put blame on both sides. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about blame. Her perspective is valid from her perspective and yours is valid from yours. But you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201591\">can\u2019t go back to the way things were. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">It... You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t physically. You can\u2019t emotionally. You can\u2019t psychologically. You can\u2019t. Like, you know, sometimes once you just break it, it\u2019s broken. Right? Now, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t put it back together if that\u2019s what you want. But that\u2019s a break in there. And you can\u2019t... You refuse <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B1\">to go back to it like that. You know? And it seems like, from at least what you\u2019re telling me, every statement she makes is confirmation that she doesn\u2019t get you. She just wants to hold onto the marriage because it paints a pretty picture. Right? But it\u2019s an empty marriage from your perspective. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B2\">what picture is that? And the picture, in some ways, is soul destroying for you because it\u2019s just a picture. You know, I think you gave the analogy of saying, you know, \u201cThis is not a marriage bed. So what difference does it mean if I go upstairs?

Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">And I\u2019ll tell you know, Seamus, she\u2019s never going to come over and fully get it. Right?

No. I think that\u2019s where I\u2019ve come to recognize.

I don\u2019t... This isn\u2019t working. I want out...\u201d Those are pretty powerful statements to be making. Those are statements you haven\u2019t made before. You have hinted at it.

I really felt like the best answer or the only answer I could give this guy last week was, \u201cHere\u2019s what I got. You know?

And you know what? I think it\u2019s sort of not about whether it works or whether it doesn\u2019t. In some ways, it\u2019s about the process. And you have to be able to look yourself in the mirror. And maybe part of being able to look yourself in the mirror is to do due diligence in the relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: So you still remain true to yourself but going to counseling, whether it works or doesn\u2019t... Right? I still think... Remember, we talked about on the phone a different one possibly. It\u2019s sort of like... You guys have been married for almost thirty years. And in some ways, if this is ending, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A91\">you have to see it to its end so that when you\u2019re done, if this is the course that it\u2019s taking, you say, \u201cYou know what? I tried and the answer was still the same for me.\u201d Right? So although it may seem like, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is going to work...\u201d You know, a lot of couples feel that way <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A92\">when they go into counseling. You know, and although I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be some miracle and everything\u2019s going to be perfect... I don\u2019t believe that things work like that. You have to do your due diligence and I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I know that it\u2019s just the hardest damn work I\u2019ve ever done before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.

There\u2019s that. (PAUSE) You know, mostly run away. You know, spending more and more time up here as opposed to being home. You know, and I recognize it\u2019s like... This whole career path, you know, I\u2019ve set up conditions. I\u2019ve set up conditions to be locked into <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B31\">a career path or, you know, a graduate school program where I don\u2019t have to be at home. I don\u2019t have to be around. You know?

Right? She with all the kind of commitments with music stuff and with Lisa, right, and you in school. Right? And are you running away or are you getting space? Because it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">CLIENT: Oh it\u2019s space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

It ain\u2019t going anywhere. I mean, it\u2019s constant. It\u2019s with you when you sleep. It\u2019s with you when you\u2019re here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C51\">You know, you are having conversations about it.

Where was I going with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Tell me what you\u2019re feeling right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(SIGH) (PAUSE) You know, I could potentially see her just like giving up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">You know, and not committing suicide but, you know, something physically happening to her that, you know, would just put her into some kind of a physical state or, you know, she would have a stroke or whatever. I mean, she\u2019s had a history of really serious migraines that I\u2019m sure, in my opinion, are <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E31\">related to the abuse issue and her inability to deal with that. And it\u2019s like, you know, she\u2019s always... She\u2019s always thinking that these headaches are going to. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, maybe it\u2019s a stroke.\u201d It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s talking herself into it. Kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">THERAPIST: So you are taking some of this on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. So it\u2019s recognizing that, you know, it\u2019s just against my nature as a person to, you know, feel somebody, you know, experiencing that much pain and not have this incredible empathy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">CLIENT: You know, and I\u2019m like...

I don\u2019t know. Because right now it\u2019s like, you know, she\u2019s just grasping at whatever little thing she can grasp onto. It\u2019s like... You know, she said something to me the other night. And I\u2019m like, \u201cI didn\u2019t give you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F71\">any indication, outside of the fact that I\u2019ve like let up on some of the anger...\u201d Because it\u2019s just really hard, you know, to be in that place of anger all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">And, you know, it\u2019s like just ask the question. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d You know, and I feel like, you know, I backed off of the anger a little bit and just asked the question, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And it\u2019s like she\u2019s interpreting that as, \u201cWell, at least we\u2019re both committed to fixing up the relationship.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F91\">I\u2019m like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s the very reason why you can\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to go home because home, once again, you know, this sort of needy representation...

I\u2019m wondering if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB1\">sort of don\u2019t see it as superficial, a little too late. And, you know, it\u2019s almost like you have an aversive reaction to it because, you know, it\u2019s so skims the surface, desperation to hold onto what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">CLIENT: Exactly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">THERAPIST: This thing that you don\u2019t even want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20203\">THERAPIST: Right?

I know that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20213\">THERAPIST: Yeah because that\u2019s when you guys stopped having sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20215\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20217\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20219\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and longer really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021B\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s where that final connection was broken. So other connections were broken up to that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021D\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, at that point, to me, that was almost like the final straw.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20221\">CLIENT: You know? Prior to that, it was living with years of rejection and feeling like I was a sexual predator and a pariah and whatnot. So it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20223\">THERAPIST: Tell me about feeling like a sexual predator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20225\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. I mean, it\u2019s just... Yeah. You know, it\u2019s like once it became known that the sexual abuse issue was something that was the fabric of our marriage, then it\u2019s like, \u201cGreat. Now I\u2019m in the position of if I want to initiate a sexual experience, then, you know, that\u2019s I\u2019m sure how I\u2019m being <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202251\">portrayed.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Well then, that just kind of puts me in shutdown mode.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20227\">You know? Or what you end up learning over time that the only way that\u2019s going to happen is if you start, you know, plying her with two or three martinis. And then it\u2019s like... Doesn\u2019t that feel special? You know, then you still feel like a sexual manipulator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20229\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022B\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like... There\u2019s no intimacy in that. It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">THERAPIST: So you just quit that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And eventually it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m done with this. I\u2019m done with drinking. I\u2019m done with the whole nine yards.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">CLIENT: You know, I didn\u2019t like what drinking was doing to me and it\u2019s just like cold turkey, done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">THERAPIST: Sure. Well, that was a way of coping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">THERAPIST: But, you know, of course, for her to not have sex and to not be asked was a relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">THERAPIST: But, for you, it\u2019s the opposite of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. It\u2019s just been like the shutdown of everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like there is no emotional relationship here because there\u2019s no vulnerability. There\u2019s no openness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">THERAPIST: But her grieving process now, her fear, her panic, right, are things, you know, her suffering is reflective of your own for years. You understand? So it\u2019s just you had been in pain and suffering for all these years for wanting this connection, denying yourself of a voice to say anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202451\">Right? And you finally exploded. Well, what you\u2019re seeing, right, is kind of she\u2019s kicked out of denial because you\u2019re kicked out of denial and now you\u2019re just seeing her reflection of the pain that you both feel. You know? You\u2019re both in pain here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20249\">THERAPIST: You know, this is not, you know... Whatever happens, you don\u2019t come away from this things absolutely clean. It hurts you. It hurts you to see her hurting. And it hurts you deeply. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But for me to sit here and say that I can just forgive and forget and move on and pretend that none of that ever happened and to pretend that everything\u2019s hunky dory and it\u2019s not...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2024A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s not possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">CLIENT: Let\u2019s revisit all of those, you know, those feelings that you had for each other 27, 28 years ago when you first got together. It\u2019s like... I can\u2019t fucking remember anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">CLIENT: There\u2019s nothing there. You know? It\u2019s like I have to get through so many layers of crap to even get back down there that I\u2019m like... And when I get there, it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re so far removed from that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">CLIENT: You know, there\u2019s been too damn much water under the bridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">THERAPIST: What... So are you guys going to go back to this guy? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019ll go Wednesday and we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll try it one more time and, again, I\u2019ll be in my truth. And it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, William. No...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So what would it... You know, and I\u2019m laughing because I told you when we talked over the phone that we had to fire... My husband and I had to fire a couples\u2019 therapist. Right? Because he just... You know, and I remember there was a point in the session where we said to him, \u201cWe don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D1\">want this. We want this.\u201d Right? And I wonder for you, if you could tell him what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">CLIENT: Well, I think that what I want is like, \u201cWilliam, we need to get everything out on the table, A, you know, so we can see what we\u2019re clearly looking at. I want to be heard. And then it\u2019s like... Departure is from here. Whatever that was, that was a snapshot of a long damn time ago.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">CLIENT: \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure that I can make any connection to that at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">THERAPIST: Or you even want to at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">CLIENT: Or even want to. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But tell him and, I mean, and sometimes a worthy discussion with Mary about what she wants to get out of it. Right? But that didn\u2019t serve your needs. And I think you can say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working for me. The solution focused approach, given how much water is under the bridge, to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202691\">point where we\u2019re drowning, that\u2019s not going to work because I don\u2019t even want to go back and look at who we were 27 years ago. I want to look at right now because I\u2019m in my right now. You know, I can\u2019t even connect to that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that\u2019s where it\u2019s at. So that\u2019s... Yeah. That\u2019s the hard stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">THERAPIST: A lot, a lot of hard stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">CLIENT: Yeah. How are we doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re doing perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">THERAPIST: Where are your kids in all this? I know over the weekend you told me you talked to your son who was pretty supportive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">CLIENT: Yeah. I haven\u2019t really talked to the other two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20279\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027B\">CLIENT: I would imagine that, you know, my daughter... I mean, she\u2019s immersed in trying to get through a musical right now. So she teaches all day and musical practice all night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027D\">THERAPIST: What is... What are their years again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027F\">CLIENT: She\u2019s 25, out teaching for three years. The other one\u2019s... The middle one\u2019s a senior in college and the youngest is a freshman. So... We have to go drive down to southern Illinois, three hour car drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20281\">THERAPIST: It is. In Pocahontas or Ferguson (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20283\">CLIENT: No. Taylorville.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20285\">THERAPIST: Where is Taylorville?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20287\">CLIENT: Halfway between Belleville and Decatur.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20289\">THERAPIST: Yeah okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s in everybody\u2019s favorite pee spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2028A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D\">THERAPIST: Okay. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the only wide place the road where you\u2019ve got a decent exit there. But, you know, we\u2019re supposed to drive down together on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20291\">THERAPIST: And what\u2019s on Friday? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20293\">CLIENT: Her musical. Penelope\u2019s directing this musical or no, not directing, she\u2019s the musical director of this musical. We\u2019re going to go down and see that. So it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20295\">THERAPIST: How will that be, three hours in the car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20297\">CLIENT: Long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20299\">THERAPIST: Yes. Right. And I remember when you were just kind of getting started with being open and honest, you would want, you wanted the time with her and she didn\u2019t. And now... I know because I remember there was an incident where she could have chosen to drive with you but she drove with Lisa. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202991\">And now the last thing that you want is a car ride. What are you going to do with the car ride?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B\">CLIENT: (SIGH) Well, you know, I guess the bottom line is just stay in authenticity. You know? And if I can\u2019t go there, I\u2019m just going to have to say, \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029D\">THERAPIST: Do you still love her? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029F\">CLIENT: You know, that\u2019s an interesting question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A1\">THERAPIST: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A3\">CLIENT: You know, do I still love her? You know, there\u2019s a lot of... You know, love is one of those tricky words to define.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A5\">THERAPIST: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A7\">CLIENT: Do I love her as a person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A9\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I want the best for her. I care about her. You know, she\u2019s part of my family. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I love her like I love, you know, Delia who lives with us and I love her like, you know... Do I love her as much as my kids? Probably not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Sure. Different kind of love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B3\">CLIENT: Different kind of love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B5\">THERAPIST: But I... Here\u2019s why I ask. I\u2019m not asking if you\u2019re in love with your wife. I\u2019m asking if you love her because that\u2019s why when she hurts, you hurt. Right? It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t love her and care about her. It\u2019s you don\u2019t know if you want to be married to her or if you have romantic feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202B51\">or if you like her or if... Love is complicated. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B7\">And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re impacted deeply by this because you do love and care about her. The marriage isn\u2019t working. Right? If you, if she was, if you were, she was a hateful bitch and awful and horrible, in some ways...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B9\">CLIENT: It\u2019d be easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BB\">THERAPIST: ...it\u2019d be easier. Right. But to see her vulnerable because of your reaction is difficult. But I think in whatever conversations that you have, part of the authenticity is, \u201cI do love and care about you. I don\u2019t know though where I am in terms of wanting to be married because I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202BB1\">I have not been happy in our marriage for years.\u201d And both of those pieces of data are true. That\u2019s why it\u2019s complicated. Because both of those pieces of data are true and they will probably always be true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s sort of like, you know, if, you know, if this wasn\u2019t... If we weren\u2019t talking about marriage but if you think back to the woman who you were engaged to. Right? You might not say you love her today. But you do care. If you heard that something bad had happened to her, you would have sad <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202BF1\">feelings about that probably You want her to be okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C1\">She\u2019s not part of your life. Right? This isn\u2019t somebody who you kind of hold a candle for. Right? You know, but it\u2019s somebody who you had a connection with. You\u2019re not emotionally immune to that connection. Right? Well, that\u2019s an even more way here. You\u2019ve had children with this woman. You have a history. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202C11\">You know, there are parts of you that know her and there are parts of her that know you and then there are parts that don\u2019t know each other well at all. You know, complicated because both of those are true. It makes it very complicated. It is not a cut and dry case and it won\u2019t be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N202C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I just need to hang onto that because (PAUSE) she\u2019s very convincing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202CB\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202CD\">CLIENT: Because she\u2019s very scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202CF\">THERAPIST: She is very scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D1\">CLIENT: And I get that. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But there is not bad guy. Sometimes shit doesn\u2019t work. We can look at why but in the end sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work or, you know, a relationship is uneven. One person is in love with the other person and the other person isn\u2019t. And it\u2019s painful and it\u2019s screwed up. But there\u2019s no <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202D31\">way to make it.. I mean, it\u2019s just unbalanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D7\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D9\">CLIENT: You know, and I get... Yeah. And try as hard as I can, you know, it\u2019s just like I can\u2019t bring myself back to that. You know, and it\u2019s like... You know, I felt like why, why all of this... You know, and it\u2019s not a huge place to go. You know? It\u2019s just like years of accumulated feelings like this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202D91\">And it\u2019s like, you know... (PAUSE) You know, I was able to tell her. It\u2019s like, \u201cLook. The anger that I\u2019m feeling is not some kind of a random anger feeling.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DD\">CLIENT: The feeling that I have is, and the feelings that I\u2019m trying to deal with, you know, is being in a relationship for seven years where the other person in the relationship has had an affair and you\u2019re witnessing all of this and you\u2019re just allowing it to happen. I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202DD1\">That\u2019s what it feels like from my side of the chair. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DF\">THERAPIST: An emotional affair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E5\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just like that\u2019s just really, really, really hard. You know? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E7\">THERAPIST: But as you process that piece with the therapist because that\u2019s what has to be out there... Put that out there. Right? Don\u2019t forget all parts of the truth. If you look at all parts of the truth, you do love and care about this woman, you know, and you\u2019re sorry and she\u2019s in pain and you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202E71\">sorry that you\u2019re in pain. Right? That is a part of the truth. You are not the bad guy. You are not a bad guy. You are not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E9\">CLIENT: (SIGH) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EB\">THERAPIST: Right? You\u2019re not the bad guy. In some ways, you cannot put on the bad guy cloak, you can\u2019t because if you\u2019re going to be genuine and honest about everything, that\u2019s not a piece that fits. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202ED\">You can feel like the bad guy or you can feel somewhat guilty or I wish... You know you wish it was a clean break or whatever. You can feel and you can wish but you cannot don on the bad guy cape because that\u2019s not true data. It\u2019s not. You know, like I said, you can feel whatever it is you need to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202ED1\">but you can\u2019t put that on. You\u2019ve been wearing that shit for years. And it\u2019s not accurate. Right? She can have her perspective and be angry and hurt and you get it. I mean, you have empathy for that. Right? But there is no blame here. Right? It\u2019s a two person contract that was agreed upon by both of <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202ED2\">you for years and now the contract isn\u2019t working anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N202EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561976\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F1\">THERAPIST: And as shitty as that is, that\u2019s life. That\u2019s life. Right? No matter how much we wish it otherwise, you know, and our relationships are not always on the same page as the person we\u2019re with and that\u2019s painful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s painful. It\u2019s painful. And it\u2019s like... (PAUSE) Yeah. And there\u2019s... Yeah.

And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FD\">THERAPIST: Not that you want to be hearing a lot of that but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202FF\">CLIENT: No. I get it. But she\u2019s... Yeah. You know, so it\u2019s difficult, you know, when she\u2019s throwing out the \u201cfor better or for worse.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not... I\u2019m thinking that sounds a little... All of that sounds a little coercive at this point.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20301\">THERAPIST: Yeah. See that\u2019s not... That\u2019s the desperation talking and not the... Which this is new for her. So I get it. But that\u2019s not going to pull you closer. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20303\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20305\">THERAPIST: But, Seamus, it would have worked before. That\u2019s the point. Do you understand? Because when I came in here and I asked and we talked a little bit about divorce or whatever and you said, \u201cI took vows.\u201d Right? Like this is kind of the way it is. This is why I\u2019m stuck. Right? That would have worked before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20307\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20309\">THERAPIST: But that doesn\u2019t work anymore. There\u2019s no way for her to know that doesn\u2019t work right now. Right? Right now it\u2019s aversive to you. You know? Like, \u201cThat\u2019s all you got? Like, ugh.\u201d But that would have worked before because that\u2019s what you said. That\u2019s what you projected, right, that you... <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203091\">You know? And now that\u2019s not okay anymore. And that\u2019s not a switcheroo or a bait and switch. That shit just happens in real life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030B\">It just happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030D\">CLIENT: It happened day by day, year by year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2030F\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20311\">CLIENT: Incident by incident.

You would have been here seven years ago, ten years ago, the next ten years might have looked very different. And we can only be where we are. But you just got here today. But this was always the point unless you remained in kind of some very deep denial. This was always the point. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203131\">You know, and I... You know, as being honored to bear witness to, even though it\u2019s a painful struggle... When you first came to this point, this was always there from the minute you walked through the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20315\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20317\">THERAPIST: You know?

I mean... And I think this is why I continue to be able to stand in it and be willing to stand in it because it\u2019s... It\u2019s just hard. And I feel like it\u2019s just kind of a thing where I get up daily and it\u2019s like you really have to like steady yourself. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20323\">THERAPIST: Well, sure because you\u2019d had it the other way before.

I get that I\u2019m that guy that pulled the plug and walked off the stage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2032B\">THERAPIST: What do you mean \u201cthat guy that pulled the plug?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2032D\">CLIENT: Oh I don\u2019t know. I suppose that that\u2019s one of those things that I\u2019m going to have to get over that too. I guess I\u2019m hearing her language in that. It\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he turned out to be one of those guys that would just throw it all away for, you know, whatever, you know, whatever...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2032F\">THERAPIST: Which guy was that? The one who stayed in the marriage for almost 35 years? The one who\u2019s going to counseling? The one who has not had an affair? Which guy was that? This is not she got breast cancer and you left, you had a disabled guy and said, \u201cForget this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20331\">That\u2019s that guy.

Like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re that guy.\u201d Which guy? Are we pulling the plug, what, to go and have an affair with a 22 year old? That\u2019s not what I\u2019m hearing. That\u2019s not what you\u2019re saying. That\u2019s that guy. See, you keep... You\u2019re hearing that guy. That\u2019s where you <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203351\">put yourself. But you are the guy. You are that guy that said, \u201cI can\u2019t fucking take it anymore.\u201d Right? \u201cI need closeness. I need physical intimacy. I need warmth and caring.\u201d That\u2019s the guy you are. And where is the bullshit in that? So that\u2019s that guy. So when you hear \u201cthat guy\u201d or you think \u201cthat <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203352\">guy,\u201d be that guy that you are not the guy that\u2019s being projected to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20337\">You cannot put on that cloak. Right? It makes no sense. Right? We\u2019re not talking about three years into a marriage. We\u2019re talking about 27 of which you, you know... If you told everybody, \u201cBy the way, this has been a sexless marriage for seven or eight years,\u201d most guys would tell you what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20339\">CLIENT: Are you fucking nuts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2033B\">THERAPIST: Are you fucking kidding me? Right? No way. That\u2019s grounds for immediate dismissal. Right? You know, so, you know... And yet, through all of it, you know, you kind of stood there with it. You know, emotionally withdrawn, depressed, angry, whatever. Right? So when she says \u201cthat guy,\u201d I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2033B1\">see where she\u2019s saying that because she\u2019s hurting and her world as she knows it is ending... It\u2019s not ending. It ended. And what does that mean now? But when you say \u201cthat guy\u201d you\u2019re the guy that stayed there for 27 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2033D\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2033F\">THERAPIST: So don\u2019t inherit that.

It\u2019s important but it doesn\u2019t change anything. It doesn\u2019t change anything. Right? Because we only ever see <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2034B1\">things from our perspective most of the time. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2034D\">But you are not that guy. You cannot take out the whip and whip your back with being that guy because it\u2019s inaccurate. It\u2019s just inaccurate.

Right? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20353\">CLIENT: No. I mean, I don\u2019t want to be going through all of this, all of this work, all of this pain and suffering only to end up, you know, back in some, you know, place that\u2019s like this much better than what it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20355\">THERAPIST: Right. But you can always feel for her circumstance and feel that this is a sad ending. Right? It\u2019s a sad ending to a story, a history, you know, a life with someone and that\u2019s always devastating.

(PAUSE) Yeah. You know, I think it\u2019s just the hard work of like continuing to stand in the truth, continuing to try to send the message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2036D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2036F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just like, you know, not probably not ready at this point yet to be able to say my truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20371\">THERAPIST: Sure. Well, and maybe the truth is still validated. But it\u2019s a very, very brave thing because it pushes all your buttons, all the buttons about being liked and all those buttons are being pushed and that\u2019s what makes it so brave. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20373\">CLIENT: Yeah.
