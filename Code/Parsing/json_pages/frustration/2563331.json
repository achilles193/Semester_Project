So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">THERAPIST: Oh. Is that what you\u2019re worried about, why she nixed it because of the 8.1?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, we\u2019ll see. Dr. Elliott thinks that it should be taken out, period, because it will get longer and will attach to other muscles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20075\">THERAPIST: Why would they be worried about the A1C?

So that\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but now Winchester\u2019s like she needs to get this done and it might be worth the risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563331\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: So I know he was writing her a note yesterday. So I saw Elliott-boy yesterday and he says, did you write a letter? I says, yeah, it\u2019s almost a book. That\u2019s how long it was. He said, what was it about? I says it was about how the infamous doctor didn\u2019t write out my prescriptions so that when <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">I came up here there were no scripts and the doctor that was here for the day didn\u2019t feel like writing it. And then if he wrote it it was going to have to wait until he had time to do it. You know, all he had to do was put it in the computer and it prints out. And he says, nope, you know how it is. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B2\">Other doctors don\u2019t want them to be on narcotics. So he says, yeah, I apologize and blah, blah, blah. I says, you\u2019ve got to have some type of communication here. I says, you know, what goes on at the front desk doesn\u2019t go to the nurse and then does it get to you? I says because nobody ever seems to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B3\">call me back. So I was there yesterday. I booked my appointment for I think the 18th it was which would be exactly 28 days for my prescriptions. I says, I\u2019m going to have to (unclear) because that\u2019s the only way I can get my prescriptions. Don\u2019t I get a fucking phone call today? This is the Falmouth <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B4\">Hospital, the clinic. I said, yes. We have to change your date for Dr. Winchester. Would you like to come in on the 25th? I said, no. I said because my prescriptions won\u2019t be there and I\u2019ll have been all run out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Oh you had the appointment just to see Winchester just for a visit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: And you wanted to do that at the same time you got the prescription.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Prescriptions. They want to know now why you\u2019re coming in every month and can you go two months and I says, well maybe I could if you know how to do your prescription thing that you have that\u2019s going to take care of everything. I says, do you have anything for the 11th? She says, no, he\u2019s all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200831\">booked up? She says, do you want us to get another doctor on the 18th? I said, no. Because they don\u2019t want to write out scripts for \u2013 well I\u2019m only here talking about getting an appointment for you. I says, well don\u2019t bother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well if you showed up on the 18th \u2013 are you sort of saying that if you show up on \u2013 when you show up for the visit then Winchester will write you a prescription then and there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: How does it work otherwise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: There\u2019s no prescriptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: But they\u2019re supposed to have a prescription? How do they want to have it set up? Where you come in every 28 days?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: He doesn\u2019t even want to do that. He wants to \u2013 like say I went in \u2013 I saw him yesterday. He would want me to see him in March so that when I went in February I\u2019d go up there just to pick up my scripts. But I\u2019ve tried that. It\u2019s not working. They\u2019re not there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: And so you don\u2019t want to run into that again where you go there and then you\u2019ve got to deal with all the \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: So I explained that to them. I think it went in one ear and out the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Do you think they\u2019re getting blowback from the insurance company like you can\u2019t see this patient every month?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why. He should be able to. Because of my diabetes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What would the problem be coming every month?

But I got a phone call back from the same girl from Dr. Winchester\u2019s office. Hi \u2013 would you be able to come in on the 11th? I says, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">well you told me there were no appointments on the 11th \u2013 he was all booked. Oh, he said to open up a slot for you. I said, okay. I\u2019ll be in and then he can write them there. You just go to the drug store, give them to the pharmacist and he will hold onto them until the following week and fill them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

He <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">says, oh, alright I\u2019ll call over. I call the drugstore \u2013 no they got no fax or nothing. I call and leave a message and the girl calls me back. She says well you know, you have 11 refills on that. It\u2019s not going to do me any good because I take two, not one. Oh. Alright. So whether he did call it in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B72\">I don\u2019t know.

There\u2019s a lot of gaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like pulling fucking teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it must be incredibly frustrating to feel like you\u2019ve got to do all this work to get the kind of care you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: If you don\u2019t want to be there to see the patients that you have, then just assign people to other doctors and quit doing it. You\u2019re only there one fucking day a week. And then like I say, some weeks he\u2019s not there at all. He\u2019s teaching or you know. He does the students \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Oh, the residents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Yeah. Amherst Health Alliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Amherst Health Alliance is associated with WR? I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. They just I think started it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, joining forces. They\u2019d be doing something like partners with NGH and all those other hospitals. How about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">CLIENT: Then I said to them, there\u2019s a \u2013 in every patient room up in that clinic there\u2019s a sign that says, if you\u2019re a diabetic \u2013 please take off your socks and shoes. Because being a diabetic you could have cuts on the bottom or your skin is all cracked and all this stuff. I said, not for nothing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D31\">never have you asked me to take off my shoes and socks so that you can check my feet. Not ever. She says, well you go to the foot doctor. Oh, you haven\u2019t seen the foot doctor in ages. I says, no, I see my own foot doctor because the other one upstairs thinks everything\u2019s a big joke, you know. Oh, we\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D32\">see you in a year. No. I get seen every three months. I\u2019m a diabetic. I get free shoes once a year for being a diabetic. I just go to my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563331\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess what you\u2019re getting at with them is they don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s doing a thorough job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s not doing the necessary things that should be done. I says to his health aid \u2013 she says well let me make you an eye appointment. So she called up and she says \u2013 I don\u2019t think I see them until May. She says you were seen in January. I says yeah, I was seen because I had an eye injury. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">Because generally they\u2019d want to see you every year the same month that you were in. So I didn\u2019t see her again until May for my eye exam. She says, alright. I says, I haven\u2019t seen the woman doctor who does the PAP smear. I haven\u2019t seen her in I don\u2019t know how many years. I says you\u2019re really not checking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D72\">off all these things. I says, I\u2019m supposed to see the podiatrist. I\u2019m supposed to be seeing the optometrist. I\u2019m supposed to be seeing another doctor. You don\u2019t \u2013 she doesn\u2019t question me.

Shit, after I wrote a three page letter, I spoke to him yesterday and it\u2019s like they\u2019re not even, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Like it didn\u2019t register.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I made an appointment while I was there yesterday. Why did you make it knowing he wasn\u2019t going to be there? Did he not tell you he wasn\u2019t going to be there until you know, the end of the day and he said block my day out from the 22nd? Whatever day it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Because they called you the next day to reschedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Well Louise it really seems like \u2013 I guess it kind of reminds me a bit of how you were feeling about Darla, at times like whoa, why am I being forgotten? Why am I being treated this way? Not kind of a feeling you\u2019ve had about that, and Mark, too. This feeling of the world is kind of forgetting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F11\">about me at times.

Oh, my next door neighbor, Annie, she came over yesterday I think it was and she says, have you seen Mark? I says no. She says, oh, I see him walking the dog. She says but then one time I thought he might have got thrown out because Deborah was walking the dog. She said, but then again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F31\">she says, I saw him yesterday and he was walking the dog. I said, oh that\u2019s nice. She said, why doesn\u2019t he come over? What\u2019s the reason? I says, I don\u2019t know and you I don\u2019t give a shit. He\u2019s gone.

We\u2019re not really \u2013 we\u2019re not buddy buddies <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B1\">but we do talk and stuff like that.

So it was like \u2013 well, we had party hats and we had horns and things. But you know, it was like \u2013 it was only for the people that went to the Christmas party.

It\u2019s just how she put it. She hung up things on the walls and said, you know, pizza being served only for those who bought tickets to the Christmas party. Oh, I know why. They idiot \u2013 our new director, another asshole, gave her money to spend for New Year\u2019s Eve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: But they wanted to limit it to people who had bought stuff for the Christmas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: So that was fair. I said, okay, fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: But it only lasted for an hour, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah, an hour, hour and a half.

I had two and that was it. I said, Jesus Christ, where the fuck is she putting it? Yeah, they\u2019re bad. So I don\u2019t know. We have this one couple who live on the first floor \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B1\">Trevor and Pat. Well they have Meals on Wheels delivered every day. I mean you get a cardboard tray with something on it for supper. For lunch I think you might get a sandwich for supper or whatever. Well, she and her husband both get it. Do you know that lady could leave it there on Monday at 8 o\u2019clock <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B2\">and it still is hanging on the doorknob at 10 o\u2019clock that night? So it\u2019s like they really need that food. And I think the two of them, all they do is smoke pot all day. They have a \u2013 they\u2019re down at the short end of the wing where there\u2019s only four apartments. And you go around that corner and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B3\">can just stand there and get high. It\u2019s bad. And Kelly will go over to her friend\u2019s house across the way from them and she\u2019ll say, \u2018why don\u2019t you get stoned on that goddamned fucking crap?\u2019 And she goes out in the hallway and she\u2019s crazy. And I says, oh well, what can you do? And I remember they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B4\">always getting takeout food delivered and he\u2019s going out to the store and he\u2019ll come back with Dunkin Donuts, the ice cream store, Whole Foods, you name it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2012A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563331\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: What about that to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, you know, come on, let somebody else have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: The Meals on Wheels?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah.

She lives in a building with a hundred people. You don\u2019t walk around in your housecoat that you can see through and the button\u2019s undone and you\u2019ve got no bra on. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. And no teeth in your mouth. You know. What you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B1\">do in your house is fine. But when you\u2019re out in the hallway or associating with other people, please get dressed. You know?

I saw \u2013 Dr. Winchester was my 9 o\u2019clock appointment. They picked me up at 8 o\u2019clock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: They really get there \u2013 they make sure to get there super early.

What\u2019s it like here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: Well, there was me and then there was a kid sitting in the other seat. He fell asleep and then he didn\u2019t see anybody. He got up and left. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: He was a kid kid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: No. Is that the heat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: No. That\u2019s somebody rolling a cart. It\u2019s a cart with a bag. Somebody\u2019s carrying luggage on a cart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I mean I just sit and \u2013 the only place I go is to Kelly\u2019s and she comes to my place. Or sometimes I\u2019ll go upstairs and see my girlfriend, Greta. She came down just at 1 o\u2019clock. She cut my hair. She brought me down a big container of meatballs, sausages and stuffed pergolas. And what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201831\">did Deborah make yesterday? Sausages and meatballs and stuffed peppers. And the day before that I had made beef stew. So you can\u2019t see anything in the refrigerator right at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?

Just enjoying being over there and not seeing a damn thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: What do you mean? You mean staying on your end?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because the only thing I can do is wave to the people on the trains that go by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: But you have a little bit of privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">THERAPIST: And you like it on that end. That\u2019s nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s got to be quite different than what you had been used to in a lot of ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah, like when I had my hair pink they used to call me \u201cPinkie\u201d. When are you putting your hair back pink? And I says, I don\u2019t know. I might do purple instead. No, we like it with the pink. And why is your hair brown? I says because it\u2019s my natural color, that\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563331\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s very different living in an apartment like that because it\u2019s more than just an apartment building. People are very \u2013 it\u2019s a social club. I mean other apartment buildings people can be very anonymous in these places but you know everybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, you get to know everybody in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Whether you like it or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Did you hear about Jeremy and Eunice? No, what? All right, fine. What\u2019s been good lately though is they have a much bigger group at Bingo now for some strange reason. There\u2019s a lot of husbands and wives that are going. And then men play cards I think three nights a week and a couple of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F1\">the wives play too.

Kelly \u2013 you\u2019ve got to call me every day, Kelly. What am I going to do, Kelly?

Is she still taking medication? Is that right? But her and \u2013 maybe it\u2019s because her and Bennett have been off and that\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D91\">of kept her feeling more stable?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563331\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Because for a while there it was really worrisome.

Kelly goes \u2013 where the fuck do you think she is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20229\">THERAPIST: She wants to be around you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022B\">CLIENT: She wants to know what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">CLIENT: I say, do I follow you over to Annie\u2019s house? No. I say well good.

I fucking hit her. I can\u2019t fucking stand him. Jesus Christ, you drive me up the fucking wall. I says, well there\u2019s a bench out back, but he\u2019ll have to share it with Deborah. (Laughs) I says, maybe he can throw his air mattress bed on the ground out there and get <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202331\">a tent, but then the raccoons and the possums, and the skunks and the water rats \u2013 hey. We live in the jungle. We get the possums that are walking around, the skunks that are walking around, the raccoons that are fighting all night long looking for food. We\u2019ve got a gopher. Oh I tell you. We had a big <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202332\">water rat the other night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">THERAPIST: Oh boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, and of course Deborah and Todd are right out there taking pictures. I would say she\u2019d be right here and the rat was right there. I says, you\u2019re lucky it didn\u2019t jump on your leg and freaking bite you, you jerk. Oh yeah, they\u2019re just wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re with their moms or the long haul, aren\u2019t they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. I says you don\u2019t even have a car that you can go and sleep in, Deborah. Can\u2019t you go to a shelter, Deborah? Do something. I says, you\u2019ve got to go back and start seeing the psychiatrist. See she won\u2019t go now because I don\u2019t have a car to drive her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see. She\u2019s not eligible for the things like the ride or \u2013 as of right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">CLIENT: Because yeah, she\u2019s not disabled. Even though she is \u2013 mentally she\u2019s just you know. I can\u2019t say mentally because she passed school with all As. Laziness? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">THERAPIST: And she\u2019s not going to do it. And she\u2019s how old now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">CLIENT: 39. She\u2019ll be 40 this year, right? I don\u2019t know. She just thinks that I should be supporting her. I said, Deborah, now like Darla wanted her to come up March 15th. I still haven\u2019t gotten her tickets for her over-the-holiday issue. I said, Deborah, I\u2019d rather spend the money on getting something <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202431\">for the house. I want to buy a freezer. Why do we need a freezer for? Because, I says, you know, Deborah, to fill the freezer because I never know when I\u2019m going to get out to the fucking store again. But she thinks because I bought two things of Mr. Clean \u2013 well she puts one back. I said, why did you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202432\">do that? Well you only need one. Why do you have to buy two? I says because Deborah I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get up there again. Just like we could go without milk for a week, Deborah, because you\u2019re too lazy to get up off your ass and walk to the end of the street to get milk. You can either go out to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202433\">the street, Deborah, or you can go out the back way to go to (Unclear). I\u2019m not spending that \u2013 I says, Deborah, it\u2019s not your fucking money. It\u2019s my money. Well, she\u2019s kind of confused about that. I have to get the cat\u2019s cat food and kitty litter. That costs me over $70 for wet cat food, dry cat food <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202434\">and kitty litter.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20242-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20242-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563331\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20245\">THERAPIST: For how long?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20247\">CLIENT: A month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20249\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Well, to Deborah, what\u2019s mine is yours and what\u2019s yours is mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">THERAPIST: Including where you live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">CLIENT: I said to her, make sure you get stuff for a salad. All she bought was the bag of salad greens. No tomatoes, no cucumber, no nothing. I says, oh, okay. Well, you could have bought it. But I said, it was on your list, you know. At least let me know what I\u2019m buying for myself. I had to buy her <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202531\">four things of coffee because she would use those (unclear) things \u2013 I bought four for her because sometimes she drinks five cups of coffee in a day. I bought three for myself and I bought two for when we have company because Deborah likes that dark Italian roast or anything \u2013 the darker it is and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202532\">stronger it is, she loves it. And, of course, I drink decaffeinated coffee. I mean she has gotten desperate enough to drink mine. She\u2019s just such a good child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, she\u2019s your roommate for life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">CLIENT: For fucking life. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m looking forward to surgery.
