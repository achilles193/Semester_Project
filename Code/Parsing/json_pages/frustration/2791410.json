If it is less shipping for you\u2014if it\u2019s just almost no shipping in the lowest spot then that is a great deal. If you want a bit more, fantastic. These numbers are\u2014Oh, shit! Look at this! This fucking idiot put up these $30 for a dollar! Let\u2019s just see if everyone else notices. I went to Pandemonium. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201713\">I was like, \u201cHey. These things were all marked way way down. This is 80% off. This is 80% off. This is 60% off. The quick bar code scan is an Ebay app. I\u2019m like, \u201cThis will go for 70%. This will go for 50% and this will go for 15%, but it is $4, $18, and $20.\u201d So I am like, \u201cGreat! I will just buy these.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201714\">Thanks guys!

I can triple my money on this and triple my money on this and triple my money on this! Like, \u201cOk. So ya, I\u2019ll totally buy these!\u201d And the funny thing is, the funniest <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201751\">thing, man, there\u2019s those three [train \u2026] (ph) There\u2019s really cool like cardboard 3-D train that clips together with special clips. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s customizable sideways. You can play good games on it but it needs these things called Terra Clips I think you can get. Pandamonium sells the maps, not the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201752\">Terra Clips. 00:44:59 Comacausie has a couple boxes of Terra Clips, not the maps. You can\u2019t sell either of these products without the other. It\u2019s impossible. So I buy at Pandamonium marked down by [\u2026per cent or 80%] (ph) the map. I\u2019m like, \u201cThanks.

There are Series <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201831\">One Skylandars, the ones I always wanted and never got: they are worth $38. Thirty eight bucks this $9 thing!
