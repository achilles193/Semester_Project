I couldn't see her, she's kind of behind a plant but I figured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Well, yes, that happened. The good thing is it just seems like the ECT is actually working, so that's nice. I feel like it was about time for a break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Maybe a little over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Maybe. But yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: The I know they memorize all those problems like you do, which is a little bit disconcerting, but it's okay. So, do you think I'm a Borderline Personality Disorder?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: No, I don't think so. I think you have some features of it or whatever they call it, some related vulnerabilities but I don't think you quite fit that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Okay. It would be okay, I just wanted to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Do you have one particular question about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I'm trying to remember why I would want to know. Oh yes, so I ended up talking with some medical students who's [inaudible at 00:02:26] basically one I'm sorry I'm really absent-minded basically I just talked to the medical students and the conversation seemed to center around Borderline <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">Personality Disorder. So they asked me a couple questions and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: But they were interviewing you or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes, basically, and they were asking very transparent questions of like do you have this symptom of Borderline Personality Disorder? And I'd be like no I don't have that symptom. [Laughing] But I, yes, just wondered. I mean it would make sense in something like I'm fairly certain my mom does <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">have it. I would not be surprised that those were the kind of vulnerabilities that could be passed from generation to generation. So, I don't know. But yes, I seem to be able to have stable relationships, which is the important thing. I mean I don't care if I have it as long as I have stable relationships. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">[Laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yes, I think that the primary feature that you lack of that prognosis. I think there are times when you have stronger reactions to things that happen in your close relationships that you're sort of not aware as such at the time. Like, I'm thinking of examples more from over the current events <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">of recently. where you talk to James, he wouldn't be so helpful, you get really hurt, and then you'd go into a tailspin, and it wouldn't be clear until later that you actually reacted strongly to something he had done or said and really upset or angry or offended about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">But it doesn't really create instability in the relationship I don't think, like you and James don't have a lot of pain. I mean there's a lot going on and it appears worst when times are easier but I you never said like there were ups and downs in the relationship, like a sense of being much closer <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">or much less close. And it was always presented sort of there was a lot of being much close or being less close, [inaudible at 00:05:40] distance if it's connecting at best. I don't get that feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I would expect the times when I was closer to James to be themselves symptoms, does that make sense? I don't know. I mean, I just feel like I'm I just feel like James and I are pretty solid, and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yes, and you kind of have that feeling in a kind of consistent, ongoing way that's atypical of Borderline Personality Disorder .

So you were in the hospital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes. I really did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I guess I [inaudible at 00:07:09]. I'm sorry you happened to be in the kind of shape where that when you need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yes. Don't worry. Doctor's in town, obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Just in time for the waiting room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes. That turned out good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Good. What did she say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: A couple days ago. I don't remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Earlier this week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes, she's great. James was pretty great [inaudible at 00:08:25].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:08:26],<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes. [Laughs] I don't know. And then my [inaudible at 00:09:22] are starting to get to me. Kind of constant low-level uncertainty, just like I wasn't sure where to get off the bus when we were coming back here. I knew there was a really good coffee shop somewhere but I couldn't remember where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">it was. I couldn't remember what it was, so I just kind of wandered around. Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: How long does it last usually?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I don't know. They say it's temporary. I imagine probably continual until I'm down to maybe once a week, maybe once every two weeks, which will be another couple two weeks. Actually ECT is not work, distracting at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Good. Glad to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: They're really nice to you. Really nice to you. All the nurses are super nice. So that's the picture (ph). I feel like [inaudible at 00:11:35], honestly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yes? Well what happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: You go in the room and you just sit down on a bed and they put a blood pressure cuff on you. Then they wheel you into the ECT room and they put a put you out. And so the part that you're conscious for, there is no part that you're conscious for. And then I think while you're out they, while <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">you're out they put gel in your hair I still had gel in my hair and I guess pass a current through your head for, which I think it's only like a couple of minutes. But it went back up and then and that's it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: And so you continue to not have headaches?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: No I haven't thankfully. I take 800 milligrams of ibuprofen a couple of hours beforehand and that usually takes care of it. I did they did forget to give it to me once last time and then I hadn't had anything afterwards, so I need to not forget that. But yes, it's really not bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes, I don't like being so uncertain and feeling like I'm not speaking very well and it seems like I don't have my act together, but I'll be okay. I can deal with it. I've seen Matt. Very funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: I guess you were there for two weeks? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes, for two weeks. That's a long time. I was really ready to be gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: It sounded that way, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: We talked on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Did we? I don't remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yes, we talked about seven in the morning [inaudible at 00:15:12], 7:45.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes, I was really, really homesick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: What were you missing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: James.

I was convinced I was going to be late to come here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh really? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes. I wasn't, we were a half-hour early but I was convinced because I missed my appointment with Dr. Vaughn (ph) yesterday well I didn't miss it but Dr. Vaughn (ph) was sick and we got to her office and the door was locked and she wasn't there. And it was and she'd sent an e-mail but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">I hadn't gotten it before.

I'm really ready to get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: You've had enough? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yes. I know it doesn't actually work like that but I'm about ready. I'm just really tired of being down all the time. I've got to go look for a job. I want to get to work on that. It's about time.

Any time now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: And then you can settle for easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: [Laughs] That is true, I would, I would settle. I'd settle for not excruciating. James really wants me to take it easy. When we were talking about my discharge, he was very anxious to insist that I not go back to looking really hard for a job right away. He really wants me to take it easy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yes, you and I talked about it as well on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Did we?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yes. No, no, no, I understand. Yes I think I heard something in regards to that. It would be a good idea whether we go to [inaudible at 00:36:34] or [inaudible] running. That I like. Had this really awesome article [inaudible] but...I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: You can just say it. I'll believe you. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I think I'd say if you wind up literally (ph) back to the hospital your job search isn't going to matter all that much. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: You make a compelling case. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: So and I when you had explained that the window for finding things was basically now to May so that we're still in the powers (ph) of continuing it on one hand, that you'd be missing sort of prime time, taking off wouldn't cut you now but not most of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. It would not be catastrophic to take some time off now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And it also seems like we'll know more in a week or two. All we know now is what it's like to be back home, what it's like to have ECT no longer, stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yes, fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I know you're eager to get moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. It won't hurt to relax a little bit. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And it would seem that he already knows and that it actually makes an awfully big difference just to feel better even for a little while. Like, it sounds like you can see really how far down you were, how it's not inevitable that you'll always feel that way. I guess what I'm saying is I imagine <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">there are things about taking it easy and the way that could help feel good that could be beneficial, though I'm also unclear that some of the toughest times for you have been when you have not worked and you wanted to or expected to [inaudible at 00:39:57].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, it's hard for me not to be working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: I just really don't want May to come up without me having a job. I just really don't want to miss out on that. I guess I have to suck it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I think that's probably a good idea for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Not for too long. I mean, not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: It's going to require some real effort to pull it off. I think I can probably do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: If it's not, I'm ready to come back. It's really not too for real I'm not going -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: No. I think it's possible that you could start doing job search next week and it will be fine. But it seems to me it would probably increase the risk a lot to wait a little longer. It may make you feel better. I agree in a way it's sort of a long way to come back but that doesn't necessarily <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F51\">mean it's going to be a long time before you're more functional than you've been. I think it'd probably be more like it may take a while to come to terms with the stuff happening and why and whatever. I understand you're somewhat divided but a good outcome would be you could do that while you're busy <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F52\">living your life more or less the way you want to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098808\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: We'll stop for now.
