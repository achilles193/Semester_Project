Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. I felt cooler than anywhere in the last three days. So I talked to my sister for a while this morning which is like glad I talked to her but the conversation left me pretty low.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like just right after (inaudible at 00:00:41) being alive again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) And she\u2019s just not doing very well. (PAUSE) And I can\u2019t fix it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: And I want to fix it and she wants me to fix it and... Or... I don\u2019t know. I think in the last few years we\u2019ve gotten into this pattern where she thinks of me as this like giving really, really good advice. Which, you know, I do think I give pretty good advice. She just doesn\u2019t ever take it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">and then I don\u2019t know what to do. (LAUGHTER) And then I sort of feel like I\u2019m just being like overbearing or something. It makes me really sad to hear you\u2019re not doing well. You know, I think her mood\u2019s pretty okay still but like she moved out of her apartment and is subletting a place that is like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">a hellhole and gave (inaudible at 00:02:05) her dog fleas after the first two days and so she is just like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just go to (inaudible at 00:02:11) right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Which they go every year, every two years, a tradition. But... (PAUSE) So (LAUGHTER) I was like, \u201cWell, do you have like a sublease agreement? Like do you have... Like are you... You shouldn\u2019t have to live in some place with fleas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: \u201cYou should be able to tell your landlord.\u201d Like vermin I feel like are really beyond the pale. (LAUGHTER) Like no air conditioning in San Antonio? Okay. Yeah, that sucks. But like I can see how that\u2019s something you just have to suck up. But like fleas? No. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: But she does have to deal with it because she doesn\u2019t have a sublease agreement and she doesn\u2019t even... Like it was just a verbal agreement. Like she did the... She\u2019s subletting it from a friend of hers so... (PAUSE) She like... And I don\u2019t know what to tell her. She doesn\u2019t... It\u2019s only for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">a month. But like she doesn\u2019t want to live there but she also is clearly not going to say anything to the people that she\u2019s renting it from. So... I don\u2019t know. You know, and luckily it\u2019s San Antonio so it\u2019s like a lot cheaper. Like she\u2019s out only like three hundred dollars as opposed to $1500. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: As she would be if she (inaudible at 00:03:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yes. You know, I\u2019m like... I say like, \u201cWell, what do you want to do?\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: She says, \u201cWell, I want to be a teacher.\u201d Which I think she would be an amazing teacher and I\u2019ve been telling her that for years. And... But... (PAUSE) So she wants to like work towards a teaching certificate but she also wants to be a sports instructor. And so I was like, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">to pick one. (LAUGHTER) You can\u2019t put all of your resources towards choosing the same time. Like you\u2019ve got to figure out what you want to do and then go for that.\u201d Which is not really what she wanted to her. You know, not like she got in a fight with me. But she kind of said, \u201cYeah. I think you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">right.\u201d (PAUSE) You know, and the things that she\u2019s worried about are the same things that I\u2019m worried about. I also want to be a teacher and don\u2019t know how to make that happen and I also feel like I\u2019m approaching thirty and really what have I done? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559805\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Like what do I have to show for my adulthood? I feel like I\u2019m not where I want to be at this point. And... I don\u2019t know. I want to make things better for her but I can\u2019t. (PAUSE) So... I already wasn\u2019t feeling terribly well. The last couple of days have not been terribly well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I guess I feel like (PAUSE) (SIGH) I\u2019m not where I want to be but I sort of have a plan like sort of figuring out how I want to get there and, you know... (SIGH) (PAUSE) And so I... (SIGH) (PAUSE) I guess I feel like I... Talking to Amanda (ph) about all these things that she\u2019s concerned about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">sort of bled over into me and so now I feel really at my wits end and I don\u2019t know what to do both for her and also for me. (PAUSE) I\u2019m just frustrated with Amanda. Like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: You know, if what you want to do is sports the rest of your life and put all of your resources into sports, that\u2019s great. Do that. You should do that. That sounds great. But that\u2019s going to come at an expense of something else. You know, I guess like (inaudible at 00:07:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just worried about her. (PAUSE) And... (PAUSE) It\u2019s not so much that like... I don\u2019t... (SIGH) I don\u2019t feel depressed in my usual way of feeling depressed. It\u2019s not like my mood has been consistently low or even as consistently low as my mood generally is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: But like the last few days the kind of suicidal thinking has come back.

(PAUSE) Yeah I guess in the last few days it\u2019s been more noticeable but it has more felt like an uptake than something coming out of nowhere <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to tell James about it because I feel like he will... That will make him terrified and uncertain and (inaudible at 00:10:43) into turmoil and then he\u2019ll be angry at me. But that also is not really a very good reason not to tell people that. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:11:01) (WHISPERING)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Did that (inaudible at 00:11:31)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: No, no.

That was not... (LAUGHTER) That was not normal people\u2019s thoughts.\u201d (LAUGHTER) But like I don\u2019t know how to tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:27) think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I will be, you know, just doing normal things like thinking, like getting up to heat some water for a cup of tea and I\u2019ll just like...

It\u2019s a cooperative game where you have a CVC (ph) you\u2019re trying to... Have you heard of this? Okay. It\u2019s a good game. And diseases control exponentially. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">You\u2019re trying to like stop it. And like it would be... It was like a pretty great game. But playing it with James and (inaudible) was very difficult because both of them... Because it was cooperative which meant we were always like talking about the best thing to do next and I didn\u2019t get to talk very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200832\">much. And I felt like some of the... A lot I felt like I got dismissed some of the time and... (SIGH) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I just... (PAUSE) It felt like a game that the two of them were playing rather than that we were playing.

And people said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">fine.\u201d Turns out, we should have focused on doing that.
