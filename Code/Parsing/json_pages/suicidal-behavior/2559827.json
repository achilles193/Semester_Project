You get the iPad (ph) worked out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I put on my IT department hat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: (Laughter) Well, you know, it\u2019s good that you have one of those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do a lot of cursing at things and then handing them to James. So the e-mail that we talked about yesterday. It occurred to me that, like, (pause) there\u2019s, I think, a pretty big difference between the examples you\u2019re giving of something that, like, feels hurtful and is constructive and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">something that is just hurtful. And the main thing that sticks out to me is that (inaudible 01:06), like, I participate in an active way, you know, both of the things we talked about are in the context of conversations. Like, both are things that, like, (pause) I\u2019m signing up for, in some sense and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">that, yeah and participate (inaudible 01:28) as opposed to just, like, being sniped (ph). Although I, like, think about that, that I say, well, you know, like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So I don\u2019t know if you know this book, \u201cThe Gift of Fear.\u201d It\u2019s, like, a very (pause) sort of well-known book that deals with, like, domestic violence and stalking, mainly. And so one of the things that it it\u2019s basically, like, how to deal with a stalker. And so the domestic violence chapter has gotten <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">a lot of criticism, I think rightly so, because basically his attitude is the first time a woman gets hit, she\u2019s a victim. The second time, she\u2019s a volunteer. And, yeah, it\u2019s kind of (inaudible 02:19). The rest of the book\u2019s really good but the, like I don\u2019t know. I guess I just wonder. Like, my first <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">thought is, you know, but there\u2019s a difference between what I am actively participating in and what is happening to me. My second thought is, \u201cBut I\u2019m putting myself in those relationships with people who do those things to me.\u201d So I don\u2019t know how distinct that line is, but I feel like there is a line. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">[That was as far my thinking got] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">That idea about domestic violence is pretty insidious. You know, like, I can tell that it\u2019s bullshit for other people, but not so much for myself. (Pause) [As with a lot of things] (ph). It took me, like, more than two hours to get to sleep last night. I just couldn\u2019t fall asleep, and it\u2019s not fun. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not so typical?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: No, not at all. Yeah, I was sort of exhausted all day. And then (inaudible 04:27) was actually (inaudible 04:30) went to bed at 10:00. I was wide awake. [And it sucked] (ph). You know, I\u2019d taken a nap in the afternoon because I was exhausted (inaudible 04:42). I am very glad it\u2019s not typical <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">for me. That\u2019s, like that\u2019s a rough situation [for me] (ph). You know, there\u2019s, like, not much to do other than stew (ph) and I\u2019m constantly thinking, like, this is going to make me tired for the whole week ahead. I\u2019m trying to, like, relax and, like, let my body fall asleep and it\u2019s just not doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">The amount that I think about suicide has been increasing, rather than decreasing. Although it\u2019s a little bit strange because my mood\u2019s been not like, getting better, rather than getting worse. (Pause) I don\u2019t know. [I just mostly] (ph) don\u2019t want to be here. (inaudible 06:28) the thing. I, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">(pause) it\u2019s like I go (ph) (pause) I had a great talk with James last night, and we, you know, talked about what we wanted to do differently next year and where we wanted to live and, you know. He was saying that he likes (inaudible 07:01) because it\u2019s not so fucking loud. (Laughter) The noise <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">in Andover really, really gets to him, and it\u2019s hard for me to remember that in some ways because it doesn\u2019t get to me. I just block it out. It doesn\u2019t bother me at all. But, you know, so I was saying, like, \u201cWell, even if we stay in Denver, like, we should look for some place that\u2019s quieter, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">(inaudible 07:24) fits in our budget.\u201d And, you know, he was saying he thought we should try to get out of the city more, which I\u2019m definitely on board with, and things like that. And, you know, it was very, like, future-oriented conversation. It was all about, like, what are we going to do together. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200254\">What are we going to do with our lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559827\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">Like, I was right there in it. And before and after the conversation, I just wanted to kill myself. (Pause) I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m, like, desperate by any means. I just feel really tired. (Pause) But it\u2019s like I\u2019m easily distracted from that. You know, not as easily like, the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">I do to distract myself are working less well than typically. But, like, I\u2019m easily distracted by other people, so, like, I sort of come to therapy and, like, I sort of want to talk about it. But, like, the other things that we talk about are a lot more interesting, so I\u2019d rather do that. (Laughter) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">But it\u2019s just, like, right there when I leave and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s to be done about it (inaudible 09:48) and hope and (inaudible 09:51).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">(inaudible 10:30) talked yesterday about, like, lack of sleep being a really tough thing for me. (Pause) Like, it\u2019s not I don\u2019t stop wanting to die when I\u2019ve had enough sleep. I\u2019m just better at dealing with it. (Pause) My dad is up in Vancouver, at the place on the bay that (ph) we used to go camping, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">my whole life. So he, like he\u2019s one of those men that, like, resisted having a cell phone for, like, a ridiculously long time, past the point where it was socially appropriate. And then once he got a cell phone, like, you can\u2019t get him off it. So he sent me a picture of the bay last night. I was pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">jealous. That\u2019s (ph) my favorite place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">You know, because it\u2019s sort of like being at the beach. It\u2019s like an ocean. Like, you can\u2019t see the other side. But it\u2019s freshwater and the water\u2019s really clean. And it\u2019s rocks, not sand. [And it\u2019s just] (ph) so peaceful. It\u2019s like you feel like you\u2019re (pause) it\u2019s the same, like, restfulness as being <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">alone but when you\u2019re with other people too. You know, (inaudible 12:54) family vacations too much. (Laughter) But it\u2019s really great. (Pause) (inaudible 13:25) didn\u2019t have anybody to go with him this year. So, like, [he\u2019s always going to go] (ph). He\u2019s always going to try to make it possible for anybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">else to go with him that\u2019s possible. But if (ph) nobody else can go, he\u2019s going to go. (inaudible 13:45) not in the cards for James and I (inaudible 13:52) I think it\u2019s working. Jason\u2019s fishing classes (inaudible 13:57).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">Do you know the poem \u201cThe Lake Isle of Innisfree\u201d?

And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made. Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee, and live alone in the bee-loud glade. And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, dropping like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">the dew of the morning from where the crickets sing. There midnight\u2019s all a glare, and noon a purple glow, and evening full of the linnet\u2019s wings. I will arise and go now, for always, night and day, I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore. Whether I stand on the roadway or on the pavements <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">grey, I hear it in the deep heart\u2019s core.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">[This is why I don\u2019t listen to music very much] (ph). (inaudible 16:49) too much. (inaudible 17:00) (crying) (Pause) So that and \u201cThe Crocodile Went to the Dentist,\u201d [a poem] (ph) that I\u2019ve memorized. That\u2019s a Shel Silverstein poem. That\u2019s sort of why I have a lot of poems memorized. (Laughter) But <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">those are probably the most revealing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: How does the crocodile (inaudible 18:17) (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: (inaudible 18:20) \u201cThe crocodile went to the dentist, and he sat down in his chair. And the dentist said, \u2018Now tell me, sir, why does it hurt and where?\u2019 And the Crocodile said, \u2018To tell you the truth, there\u2019s a terrible, terrible ache in my tooth.\u2019 And he opened his jaws so wide, so wide, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">the dentist, he climbed right inside. And the dentist laughed, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t this fun?\u2019 as he pulled the teeth out, one by one. And the Crocodile cried, \u2018You\u2019re hurting me so! Please put down your pliers and let me go.\u2019 But the dentist just laughed with a \u2018ho ho ho,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I still have twelve to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">go. Oops, that\u2019s the wrong one, I confess. But what\u2019s one crocodile\u2019s tooth more or less?\u2019 Then suddenly, the jaws went snap, and the dentist was gone, right off the map. And where he went, no one could guess. To north or south or east or west. He left no forwarding address. But what\u2019s one dentist, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B3\">more or less?\u201d (Pause) I think I\u2019ve had that one memorized since I was, like, six.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">(inaudible 20:38) a baby, so that part really, like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: The kid\u2019s a baby, so that part really like (crosstalk 20:43).

Yeah. They like poetry though. Like, they have a couple of poems with poetry for children. The next time we go to the library. (Pause) Yeah, they really they like poetry and they like songs. But it\u2019s sort of, like, they\u2019re not really used to singing along, so they, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">just want me to sing all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me that (pause) (inaudible 22:05) or [these poems] (ph) or suicide. In a way, like, are some of the best sort of relief that you get. That is partly why (pause) (inaudible 22:51) suicidal. (inaudible 22:56) I mean, there are other reasons as well that would make it difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">(inaudible 23:01) freak out.

(Pause) The thing that\u2019s been hard in the last few days is that, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">even when I have time where I\u2019m alone and I am, like, explicitly taking a break or, like, resting or, like, trying to refresh myself in some way, like, that is also hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 25:12) it occurs to me it must be the toughest thing in the world for you to call me when you\u2019re feeling suicidal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: That must be the absolute last thing you feel like doing.

You know, a lot of times, I\u2019m just like, \u201cWell, I just want to go to bed.\u201d Or, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">I want to have a beer and watch television, or things like that. But, like, [even that seems hard] (ph). (inaudible 28:25) not doing what I want to do and, like, what the next best thing is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I wonder if in your wish to kill yourself there\u2019s also a wish to kill everybody else.

I was thinking about the afterlife yesterday and it occurred to me that, like, it is very important to me that there be an afterlife for other people, but not for myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: You hesitated a little as you were saying that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I feel like that\u2019s sort of a grim thing to, like, spend my Monday afternoon thinking about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">I don\u2019t want to have to participate. (Pause) I usually don\u2019t think very much about the afterlife because (pause), well, to be honest, I think that\u2019s where theology breaks down, like, for me. Like, I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I just don\u2019t buy any of this.\u201d And I also feel like (pause) it doesn\u2019t actually matter <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">very much to me. It shouldn\u2019t matter (inaudible 31:48). You know, I\u2019m not somebody who deals with injustice in the world by saying everything will be okay in heaven. It doesn\u2019t (inaudible 32:16) or, like, respecting the injustice that\u2019s in the world. (inaudible 32:35) the worst thing.
