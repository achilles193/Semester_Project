I looked over the billing stuff this weekend and boy it\u2019s unpredictable. So it\u2019s hard for me to make up a bill because I don\u2019t know who the insurance is going to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Because sometimes they pay me and that\u2019s okay with me. And the amount even changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It looked like it went up which is good for both of us, which is good I guess. Except for you. It went up from 80-something to $103, so for the sessions I\u2019m just crediting you three bucks essentially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: In other words I\u2019ll like charge you (unclear).

The other thing is that they seem quite \u2013 actually, I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re spotty in paying or if the dates they haven\u2019t paid me they paid you for but I just haven\u2019t heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right. Like how would you hear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: They usually send me a paper record, but I ignore them because when they pay me they send me an electronic indication of that with all the information, so it\u2019s very easy for me to like (unclear) and everything\u2019s cool. But otherwise \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: They send a thousand individual \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: They send me a whole bunches of pieces of paper and I just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: So I\u2019m not sure what to do. I guess part of the reason I say that is because (Pause) so I think there are dates from April that I don\u2019t have records of them having paid yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay. So would it be helpful for me to go home and figure out what they\u2019ve paid me for the last several months and what is still outstanding or what they still have not paid me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess if you have those dates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I\u2019m \u2013 I know that we have all those pieces of paper somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I know James\u2019 been keeping track of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Okay. Is that a, like a reasonable thing for you to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">(Pause): [00:02:59 00:03:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: The other thing that I thought of which would make this simpler, but also would add some work for you, although I think not a lot \u2013 would be to just have you send them claims. Like I would give you a statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: I think we can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Of like the dates that we met and charges and I\u2019d probably give a diagnosis or something and then you could submit that to them somehow, my thought being \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, we submit the claims for Dr. Hoffsteder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Okay. Well, we can do that. (inaudible?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Okay. It\u2019s easy for me to make up that kind of bill and I guess you never know, but my thought is if that just sort of takes me out of the loop, then it\u2019s kind of like they\u2019re either paying you or not paying you, but it\u2019s not like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: (Laughs).

That might explain the problem<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: So that might be why they\u2019re switching to paying you, but I don\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: That wouldn\u2019t explain why they\u2019re paying me. That would explain why the reimbursement went up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Because they don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know why the rate would be $103.

I\u2019m sort of happy to do anything you want to do on this because my thought would be, to me the simplest step would be step one \u2013 figure the date they paid you. If you give me those, or if it\u2019s easier I can give you the dates that I have of our meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And if it turns out that they\u2019re actually keeping up with the payments and just randomly paying one or the other of us, in that case (unclear).

That\u2019s where (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: And how are you going to make up a bill for the last month when \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: They have 60 days to decide what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Okay. So I\u2019ll just send you like our records of what they say they\u2019re paying you, what they say they\u2019re paying me. How far back should I go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: I think April?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Okay. And I will talk to James, like part of this is we\u2019re trying to make it so that I do more of the work here, but we sort of haven\u2019t done that yet. So I\u2019ll talk to James about like what it would mean for us to submit the claims and because I feel like, oh, that would be easy, but actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">(unclear) James could think of that, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. All right. And I\u2019m happy to do it more or less whatever you guys want.

That would be good if we could reschedule although I tutor and usually don\u2019t get back from that until about 2, so late afternoon may not work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Okay. When do you go to tutoring?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: Actually, like a quarter to nine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s a long trip.

All right so I\u2019ll (unclear) in mind. (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: Okay. Thank you. So as it turns out I \u2013 we didn\u2019t go on the beach. We went to the island but it rained the whole day, so. So of course it was intermittent on and off raining so we rented bikes and rode bikes in the rain the whole day. It was pretty good, actually. Everybody got sunburned somehow. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A31\">And it felt deeply unjust to me because we couldn\u2019t put on sunscreen because we were so wet and it couldn\u2019t stay on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559813\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And yet \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: And yet \u2013 James was bright red by the end of the day. But that was cool. Yeah, it was a really good day, actually. Of course, his parents were hilarious. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re not my parents but I enjoy them a lot. His father works in a naval auxiliary company and is very much the role all the time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">like we were supposed to meet him down at the docks at 9:45 \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve never really been sure what a naval auxiliary company does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure either.

He is not, I think, affiliated with the military but like sometimes their ships get co-opted by the military.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Do things like spy on North Korea.

So we were eight minutes late to meet him and as we got there he was like at the telephone in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">a booth trying to call us because we were late. And on the way back he was like, \u2018got to be there at five.\u2019 And it\u2019s just \u2013 he was very nice. He\u2019s like me. He was like eerily like my father in some ways.

So when we got back we\u2019d ended up tracking some mud onto the boat because we\u2019d been biking in the rain all day. And it was a new boat and he\u2019s really proud of it. And so he says, \u2018so, have you guys been walking through the mud?\u2019 Kind of like trying to make us feel guilty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB1\">about that. And James said, \u2018yeah, you know, we were in some puddles. What are you going to do? I know for a fact that this boat will be washed down. I have washed these boats.

And I\u2019m just really not at all. Parts of that were rough <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB1\">though (unclear).

In other words, like I guess I thought as you were talking, maybe there is also a kind of smoothing over <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201331\">quality to the way you put it which in addition to the larger truth of what you\u2019re saying, seems like an important part of what you\u2019re saying or the way you\u2019re doing it is the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And I try to frame that in a way that\u2019s true but also that I\u2019m comfortable with. I think it\u2019s just that that framing doesn\u2019t stick necessarily for a long <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201431\">period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">THERAPIST: Your?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">CLIENT: In the way I frame it in like the comfortable way.

And so then I have to like defend this framing of it and so it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201471\">not complicated and distressful. But also it\u2019s not, that\u2019s not saying what I really have to do.
