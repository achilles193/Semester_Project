In other words, like maybe you\u2019re kind of twisting that, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">you have mixed feelings about wanting it, (into wanting to be) (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: (pause) Okay. (pause) [0:19:14] (pause) (Knowing me) (ph), I think you\u2019re probably right, with the pain it causes, that makes sense.

But at least this way, if I don\u2019t know about this, I don\u2019t leave; I could be around for the rest.
