I really don't know what we -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh, what we left on, we were talking about the whole parking thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: The parking, like trying to pull in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, right. [0:02:47.0]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: That was interesting. The one thing I did say last time was that I called my dad, to talk to him about being a physician's assistant, I think, something like that, but he didn't answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: So he called back and then I said something like, you know, I was thinking about an PA last week but that was last week, so now I'm thinking of something else. I kind of like relished the stick to it, almost as if punishing him for not answering my phone call, silly as I guess it is kind of silly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: What did you make of him not calling you back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: You mean not answering? [0:03:47.4]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Too busy. In those scenarios, sometimes most often, I don't handle it logically. Like if someone doesn't answer, I feel sometimes like oh, they must not like me, or I don't know, I must really have done something wrong by calling him. Also, it's not like my dad's ever really pushed me to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">anything up, that I love to simply complain about parental situations. I think it might be helpful to explain. He once asked me if I ever thought about going into the medical field, and then when I said no, he was pretty upset. Like I remember being in my car and him just being not pleased, but it only <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">came up once. And so dangling the prospect of being a PA, just because of the urgencyof the job, I was thinking would be nice, but the prospect of dangling it is sort of a way to hurt him I guess. [0:05:13.2]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">Also recently, I went to his office because really, I haven't seen many lawyers. Since he was a lawyer, I haven't seen many lawyers through the course of my life. On that occasion, I vacillated between visiting him or not visiting him, because he's in the same office. I don't see him that often any <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">more, maybe like once a month. To not see him at all, does not seem as attractive, but I decided against it. And he said, \"Oh, so I guess you were in my office, I'm surprised you didn't stop by.\" So when I went back for something else, I decided to go into his office, and I went in there, he has a new <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">office now, and he had everything sort of organized. I think in his old office, over the course of the years, he'd grown very comfortable with it and it was very small, but there were usually files around, a little bit of clutter, but this room was organized to perfection. There were pictures of large <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D3\">ships on the wall and the books were neatly arrayed. I don't know, it was probably a dark wood desk but I don't actually remember. It gave the impression of being very it's a corner office, it seemed very organized. There were pictures of the family there but everyone's picture in the family was there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D4\">except mine. [0:06:55.0]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099655\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: So I decided to leave at that point, I didn't stay. I want to go into journalism. Do you know anybody? No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: In journalism?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's a dying industry I hear, but I only want to because I think I could do a really good job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: But the walking in the office, not seeing your picture up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. It's as if my story had become too confusing for him to handle as a father, or too painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: What do you suspect he thinks of you or he sees you? [0:07:59.6]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I think he's bound to me by familial ties and he's like a dutiful father, but he's I think he's pained and disappointed by the fact that I and confused, but the course I've chosen to take with my life, because in the time that he and my mother grew up, college was a badge of distinction <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">and achieving academically. I don't know what I might say there, but going through college was the right of passage for respectability, and I was given every opportunity academically, but I basically threw it in the trash for reasons I was never able to adequately explain. I tried very hard, with Birmingham <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">specifically. It was one of those things I didn't believe was true, until I got confirmation from an administrator, like I made sure to ask them specifically if there's any way the Birmingham thing might fall through, before I even informed my parents, a month after I knew I was accepted into the program. [0:09:26.3]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">So, you imagine his pride, when he's told people in his office, one of the people in his office had gone to Birmingham themselves, and then it turns out I don't go, I imagine that's somewhat disappointing. It was the one situation I can remember, where my mother not my mother, where he sort of wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">there weren't sort of bounds on his affection or his... his pleasure, I don't know. He was like jelly. He didn't know what to say because lo and behold, he's shipped his kid off to boarding school and more or less ignored him for the past five years, and just shelled out the cash and now his kid's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">going to Birmingham, so you know, lucky him. He was happy. I might have said before, I mean that's the only occasion the most things my mother says about my father is, you know, pop is going to be mad if you don't do this or pop's going to be disappointed, because he is, he's an upstanding man, he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F3\">does right. He's a very positive influence for everyone around him. [0:11:27.6]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">One occasion she said you've done good. That's the most praise I got for anything I've ever done in my life, is that you've done good. I made my father happy basically, she said, but that was after her initial reaction, which was sort of envious, she was fine. When I first told her I got accepted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">Birmingham University she said, \"You can't go.\" And it wasn't because it was just because she was still I mean, she's what 20 or 25 or 30 years older than me, and she's still not really, she doesn't have a firm grip on live, and so when her son has the possibility of achieving something, though <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">she had pushed me previously, it's sort of like one of her favorite things to state is that from her experiences at work, is that people only help you until you're at their level. Once you rise above them they just hate you. You know, people will help you up to their level but if you try to pass them, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200513\">they will tear you down. And that's her statement, so I assume she's somewhat affected by it as well. [0:12:46.2]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099655\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Or she might have implied that between the two of you, hey you've reached some level that I hadn't gotten to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, she would never say that. That was her initial that was like her reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Her reflexive response. And then your dad being you know, this rare moment of him being proud of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. She called back, I think a week later, and then she told me that I'd done well. I think I'd been in a depression after that call, but that's also, that's a function of after talking with my parents sometimes, I just get really depressed, but I think my mother especially, sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">my dad, but I just go into like a funk. It doesn't matter where I am. I can be very happy with what I'm planning to do and have something laid out, and then as if on cue, my mother will call and I'll feel terrible. I don't even know I think it's less the case now, but definitely up to a year ago, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">she'd call and I'd just feel terrible. [0:13:54.9]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">And for my part, I'm not sure I've adequately explained the transition. I mean, I've had some successes in my past, and I think I have the capability to do good or great things, but I'm more of just a drag at this point. I mean, I've taken some assistance from my parents, I use my brother's car, my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">younger brother's car. I'm constantly forming plans that could pay off for me personally and then perhaps benefit the family as well, if work would pay off for me. I do feel like a dead weight, so you know, a feeling of guilt in response to their calls may not even be in relation to anything they say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">so much as my real or perceived history and relationship with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, how did they react to you leaving college? [0:14:57.9]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, my mom just said leaving college... Not much was said. If me going back and harping on Birmingham ever sounds annoying, I'd like you to tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: It doesn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It doesn't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Okay. Because after that, she sort of was like frenetic. She was like formulating these plans, she's saying here's an artist colony you can go to here, things you can do. She was getting involved in my life again, but I sort of pushed her away because I did not want her collaborating in my development <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">again, or I didn't trust her to I guess, maybe because of Lawrenceville, I don't know why, but I absolutely did not want her... And in retrospect, a lot of the things she says and her suggestions are like perfect, but at the time they occur, they're so coarse and they're so opposed to whatever direction <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">I'm thinking of taking, that they seem out of the question. So, you know, at the time, through some weird religious process, like a cabal of people met and decided to rescind my nomination. I was pretty depressed, but she was proposing very like enterprising, interesting, even prestigious, programs, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200673\">that I could have taken at that point, but I just wasn't really prepared emotionally to do that. [0:16:27.9]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099655\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: They would have been good moves. How did they respond? So that's one phase, because I left college twice; once to just travel and with I don't know, Bob Dylan-esque aspirations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Your time out in Portland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right. The next time, I just sort of fizzled out and went home, and I remember my mom was driving me from somewhere? Oh yeah, so when I left school the last time, I stole my friend's care and had my other roommate come along, so that I could take the car back, because I needed his car to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">stuff to the bus station, and he wasn't using it. So we used it to take some stuff to the bus station and I loaded up all my stuff up on a bus and went home and showed up and called my parents, sometime near the end of December, probably halfway through, and my mom came and picked me up. She didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">ask me any questions. I think I explained the facts in a few short sentences, but she didn't press much. [0:17:50.1]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">And then I stayed home for 2008, 2009. I stayed home for almost exactly is it almost exactly a year? It could have been two years, but I don't even remember, but I stayed home for an extended period of time and really, we didn't really I think my dad made a few stabs at it, like trying to talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">it, but he always asked why did this happen. As far as he knew, everything was going great, and then I just failed a bunch of classes the semester before I was supposed to go to Birmingham, what happened there? But from my point of view, I'd sort of been really unhappy since sophomore year at Lawrenceville, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">so it had been something that was long in the making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Ah-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: I'd always managed to pull my shit together at the last minute, but the semester before Birmingham, I just didn't have the will or the it didn't come together. I didn't even want it to come together. So that was like a disconnect. I kept saying that and they didn't really understand that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">like they didn't connect with the fact that I'd been pretty miserable for the past few years. [0:19:19.1]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it was kind of a long time coming in a way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And they didn't have a real sense of that ever, while you were at Lawrenceville.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I totally protected them from it and that's not an altruistic thing. I have sort of a I feel sort of a terrible guilt because I don't feel it at this moment, but there was something there, where my family was shelling out big cash for me to go to Lawrenceville. In my eyes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">Lawrenceville was a lot less than it purported to be, than they thought it was, and I knew it was crap basically, by all my standards. It didn't measure up, it was just a sort of distinction, but I would never tell them that, because if I told them that, I would lose my independence. I went to boarding <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">school so that I could get away from my family, but I also expected to start my independent life. For whatever reason, I wasn't able to pull that independent life together at 15, so yeah, calling out faults for it. The school or me or my parents is kind of irrelevant. The fact is I couldn't pull together <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D3\">the independent life I wanted to, but if I had told them that the school was perhaps less than I thought it was, I would have been pulled out of the school or my independence would have diminished.

Independent life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Well, friends, and I think foremost was a sense of what I would classify as sort of a political ascendance, like a meritocratic rise. I didn't have much sense of money at that time, but I had a sense of what was important, and I wanted to be someone who was very at that time, I suppose I expected <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">to be someone who shaped society in a significant way. I didn't have any profession in mind but it seemed to me that I was entering a class of people who or I would be entering a class of people who valued what was important, you know, intellectual pursuit, conscientious not conscientious. Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200852\">a conscientious approach to society really, for social change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Hmm. [0:23:04.3]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, I imagined being sort of being a bad boy, of all things, I guess, but I was so sheltered that I didn't really understand the level of experience my peers would have, from their lifestyles. I expected to be probably like one of the dumber people at the school, but I was still one of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">smartest, I think I can say. Like I expected to learn from everyone around me but the fact is, when you get there, everyone sort of filters into their own specialized, everyone cares about different things. They don't care about my academics or philosophy. You take one class and one person is clearly <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200892\">the smartest, then the other people are faced with a choice of okay, what are they good at? If they're not as smart as this guy then maybe they're the social person who has a lot of friends or maybe they're the funny person, maybe they're the athletic person, you know, but if you can't really, if <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200893\">you think you can't top someone else in a particular realm, then you sort of balkanize and take on your strength, or you're just kind of satisfied with mediocrity or whatever.

Like I was thinking the one thing that really struck made him happy or proud rather, was this achievement, this kind of like really big time achievement, the Birmingham. But that you didn't know where you really stood with them if it wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">you know, if it didn't reach that level of acclaim or something, or prestige, in terms of pride. You said it sounds like he's, as you say, an upstanding guy who's going to be dutiful. [0:25:36.2]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I, I hadn't thought of that before. In my own mind, the time when I got accepted and I was just sort of failing my classes, I took it for granted that Birmingham would be disappointing, like it was something I prepared myself for. The interesting thing about the perceived my roommate's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">going at it and how I perceived them going at it, you know, after I had had sex or established relations, the interesting thing about that is it sort of prepared you, whether it occurred or not, it prepares you for the worst case scenario emotionally. How does that connect? So I had sort of assumed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">based on my experience with Lawrenceville, that it wouldn't be everything it was cracked up to be.

So what did you learn <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">in school today? And you'd tell him what you learned and he'd be like oh, that's nothing, like you haven't learned algebra yet. And that's like from elementary school through to like it was like every day and it was strange, because trying to explain it to somebody, because he does it in like a laughing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D2\">way, like it's a completely joking way, but at the same time it's completely dismissive.

I think a lot of what I've done, I hoped to receive some recognition from my parents in some way that I might not be conscious of, but they usually rebuffed and I'd pull out really soon, really soon. Like I was a pretty good singer\/songwriter, and I performed at a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">family function, having composed a song that morning and then memorized it. We were having a surprise party, so everyone had to hide, so I made it in the morning and then memorized it while we were hiding, and then played it an hour after we stopped hiding, and it was like seven minutes long, and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A12\">had like finger style and it was good, like the story and the narrative and how it fit the person whose 50th birthday we were celebrating. It was very cohesive and it was sort of celebrated. It was celebrated by the extended family, but then I remember looking at my father in that time and he was looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A13\">back at me without happiness or... I don't know he was just sort of... I don't know how to describe how he was looking at me. [0:29:53.7]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: What did you see in him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: It wasn't encouraging and it wasn't hostile. Maybe a touch of envy? I don't know. I remember another instance when I was playing too, I told you there's one sort of patriarch of the family and he usually, he was singing old songs, sort of old timey songs, and I'd sort of play a song too, of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">my own, or that hadn't heard before, it was on my mind. But I remember feeling bad for him. I think I stopped. People at some secret gatherings actually, this one where I played, they always ask me to play, but I always shied away from it and part of the reason was I recognized, in the patriarch, a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A52\">sort of hurt, like he wasn't needed any more or anything like that, and I wasn't sure actually, I was sure I couldn't take on his role and I didn't something of it was just feeling... Maybe it's dubious, but I definitely felt guilty.

It's like a way of getting a handle on all the past hurt too, to shaft him in that one instance where he was actually, he feels, you know, he's arrogated some pleasure or something.

Hey, this is what it your pride is here, now it's gone, because of this Birmingham thing. Well what about the rest of our relationship?

I already told you that, yeah, so, but yeah, I did say PA, and so I told him I wanted to go into journalism now and what he thought about that, but he only described about being a PA and what's that like, and then he I started talking to him but <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F52\">he had to go.

I'd like to think I was pretty mature about it, and I sort of rebuffed in my own mind, the idea that it was harmful to me in any way, but it's possible it was. I mean, the very fact that I felt that argument in my head that it wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">hurtful to me may be evidence that it was. You know, he was never he brought me to basketball games but then he never stayed.
