But, that night, I was just getting started. We were playing charades with the exchange students.

[Chuckles] That was just \u2013 [chuckles] it was an in joke with Oliver. He hated a problem [ph] so much. Regardless anyhow, so \u2013 but yesterday, I went to Eugene\u2019s [ph] for Sunday \u2013 Sunday at Eugene\u2019s is a thing, usually, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">for sports ball, right now for sports puck [ph] next week for Sports Super Bowl.

A pile of people smoke weed and drink a lot and, because the weed is an anti-regurgitant, you get poisons, and your body doesn\u2019t know how to throw it up anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">INTERVIEWER: Oh, right.

And after three heavy ones of those, I still did not use the bathroom like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty dehydrated.\u201d I had more and more water. And, on top of that, some lithium, some Lamictal [ph] and Klonopin, and then a Prilosec.

When the other lamp goes off and only the bed lamp remains, he knows it is time that we\u2019re going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">bed. So he is like, \u201cOK,\u201d so great. I turn off the light, throw my arm over him, pull him in, teddy bear mode, and we fall asleep. I wake up, still alive, so that is good. [Pauses] But at 2 a.m. in the morning, I\u2019m sitting there, like, \u201cThis is important information.\u201d I can look at myself in the mirror <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">and I look like shit.

And [pauses][sighs] still, it can be pretty powerful. Like pretty powerful to read through the memories of dead people, [pauses] and by, so doing, you get that understanding for who they were. I told that to \u2013 I mean, I was told this in the past by Adam <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD1\">[ph]. He was texting one day, when you still had the office down the way, [inaudible at 00:12:54] over there, and he is like, \u201cI\u2019m really, actually upset.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">I go, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d He is like, \u201cI just found out my father has prostate cancer.\u201d If had known then what I know now, I would\u2019ve been like, \u201cLook, don\u2019t worry about that. He can live with prostate cancer, basically, your entire life. It doesn\u2019t kill you. They don\u2019t even really test for it anymore.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF1\">And, even in hospice, Ginny [ph] was like, \u201cYeah, the doctors scoff at prostate cancer. They know something will kill you first \u2013 something else will always kill you first.\u201d So [pauses] I guess, at stage three, they might operate if you\u2019re young enough, and it is like, \u201cNo, other things are currently <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF2\">killing you.\u201d But in stage one and two, if they operate, they just reduced your quality of life for no reason.

He was the son of my Aunt Patty, on my mother\u2019s side, the youngest of the siblings there.

They live a long time despite \u2013 [pauses] my grandfather outlived my grandmother by <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A91\">about two months, as is the way. They were both deep into their eighties. She\u2019d gone full-on dementia. She\u2019d been slipping slowly into it for years. My grandfather \u2013 well, he may have not have smoked \u2013 lived in a home, whereas she smoked two cigarettes a day.

What can I say about her? You know? And once I figured out how he did it, my mother and his wife are his and-and-and-and-and-and [ph] on both sides of him, trigger-trigger-trigger-trigger-trigger-trigger <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB2\">[ph].

In my adult life, I spoke to him on the phone and lost about five minutes. I saw him twice \u2013 three times, three times, each time for not more than a meal. There was Easter, there was Thanksgiving, and there was one of my mom\u2019s weddings. Those are weddings, so he just kind of showed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB1\">up, and they were in a church and hanging out, through the wedding reception more than anything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">INTERVIEWER: He went to one of the [inaudible at 00:27:59]? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">RESPONDENT: Well, yeah.

Yeah, it was just the same as the one we\u2019d grown up going to, so it was easy to find your way around. [Chuckles] It is like, \u201cYeah, I know where everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF1\">is. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Well, it was like, \u201cWhere is the bathroom in this place?\u201d \u201cAh, it is over this way.

He described the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan pretty accurately. He was one of the first up and over the hill. [Pauses] The first thing he saw when he came around the corner was a Nazi officer, whom he just, on reflexes, shot dead with <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C31\">his rifle.

Yeah, we called it shell shock back then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, that is how they learned, on all that stuff, about trauma, on those guys, the war veterans.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563339\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">RESPONDENT: Yep.

That is [inaudible at 00:29:40] \u2013 black scenarios [ph]. That is also Pepper [ph], yeah. Yeah, [pauses] I didn\u2019t know that I was going to talk about him. I was \u2013 I took a tiny screwdriver I had, and I was pushing it against my carotid just to see what that felt like, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D71\">how much pressure could I put there before pain would set in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">There wasn\u2019t really any pain. [Pauses] But I was \u2013 at the same time, I could see how easy it would be to puncture this [pauses] \u2013 but again, my thought with suicide is that you\u2019re probably going to fail, probably going to fail. [Pauses] Poverty is bullshit, by the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">INTERVIEWER: What was Friday like?

I can\u2019t talk to Charles or Victor. [Pauses] Eugene is at work. I don\u2019t want to talk to Eugene about this stuff, anyway.

I fucking hate that.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI had a plan \u2013 right? \u2013 you were going to go to Ursula\u2019s. I was going to order a pizza, sit in the dark, and watch World War Z, and that was what I was going to do right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2021B1\">like, put a hood over my head and blankets around me, and just eat fucking pizza and watch this shitty movie. That was my plan.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021D\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, that really pissed you off or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah! And I was like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20221\">INTERVIEWER: Do you want to tell me what the what \u2013 what\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20223\">RESPONDENT: Because of \u2013 because it is stupid, because she will always drop anything at the slightest hint that I\u2019m sad or depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20225\">INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20227\">RESPONDENT: And I told her, \u201cThis makes it worse.

I was just like, \u201cDon\u2019t ever, ever cancel your plans because you think I might be sad. Do not do that.

It is just \u2013 I mean, it is two things \u2013 it was, one, like, \u201cNo, no, no, I will be the martyr. I\u2019ll fall on my sword and cancel all my plans just to be this thing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">INTERVIEWER: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">RESPONDENT: And, at the same time, it was like, \u201cOh, so I\u2019m the crazy person you need to accommodate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">INTERVIEWER: Ow, OK. OK, I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">RESPONDENT: I was like, \u201cI am perfectly capable of being crazy by myself.\u201d Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">INTERVIEWER: Oh. Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">RESPONDENT: \u201cI don\u2019t need you to change your shit, as if it is somehow going to fix any of this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">INTERVIEWER: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">RESPONDENT: \u201cWhat would you do?

And we can\u2019t just change everything because of how I am. Right? I told her \u2013 so she left. She left. She went to see Ursula. \u201cGreat. Go. See her. Pretend everything is fine and go and see your friend. All right?\u201d And so she did. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202471\">She stayed out late and she came back late.

It was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah. So some of the \u2013 sense of \u2013 if you talk about suicidality, it is like more of like what people are going to think. It is more of a sense of this [inaudible at 00:38:34]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">[Crosstalk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, are they going to be able to fucking handle it?

This is just your genes. That is just the engine of this molecular machine that wants to pass on its <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F1\">genes. Right? Can you be stronger than the machine? That is what suicide is about \u2013 can you be stronger than this meat, than this body you ride around in? That is what suicide is about \u2013 can you be strong enough to do it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">Not many people can. And I applaud them when they do. I told you about my friend \u2013 Isaac Vaughn right? \u2013 years and years ago? He\u2019d always been depressed. He\u2019d probably get medication and therapy, but he wasn\u2019t exposed to those things or didn\u2019t have access to those things. This was back in the late \u201890s, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202611\">when there was still an enormous stigma with actually going to see therapists; I think there is still some now but much less so, and I will \u2013 and I am prepared to fight anyone who challenges me, based on the fact that I go to therapy. So [pauses] \u2013 so he was always \u2013 he was a great guy. He was sweet, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202612\">though, and creative, and he was funny, and he\u2019d only see your depressive swings; yeah, it was hard to get them out of him, because you can\u2019t get someone out of a depressive swing \u2013 right? \u2013 their chemicals are gone and then they can come back later. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">We all loved him, even though I punched him in the stomach once. But he was religious, and [ph] \u2013 it was years ago, in early 2000s \u2013 2002, 2003? \u2013 2003. A bunch of us were playing World of Warcraft, in separate places, but Charles and I were playing. And Victor was online, Lion was online \u2013 both of <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202631\">them \u2013 well, in any case, we were geographically distributed but we were all playing World of Warcraft. And George \u2013 or Lion, as we call him, because his penis is like a turtle, extremely small and [inaudible at 00:41:36] \u2013 but the \u2013 [chuckles] it is funny because he is [inaudible at 00:41:40]. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202632\">he logs on. He is like, \u201cIsaac Vaughn killed himself.\u201d And Victor shut down as he does in traumatic \u2013 as he has learned this through therapy, traumatic events \u2013 if Victor \u2013 he has 15 minutes to write down what happened. His hope is gone [ph] with the last 45 \u2013 just gone. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20262-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20262-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563339\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20265\">[Pauses] I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d And, apparently, he had a job lined up in a different city and an apartment lined up there, as well. And so he packed up all his stuff, put it in his car, left his old place, left his old job, and was en route to get \u2013 it was much further south when he found <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202651\">out that the job had fallen through and the apartment had fallen through. So now he lives in a car. Everything he owns in the world is in a car. He has no place to live and no job. He stops at a motel \u2013 a motel, he checks in, and he just takes as many pills as he can, and he died. And we had a forum <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202652\">[ph], a people\u2019s reunion where we could just \u2013 just as a private forum, just for his college friends to stay in touch. This was before Facebook existed, so this is what we used. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20267\">And [pauses] there was a thread on there [ph], on Isaac Vaughn. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is dead [ph].\u201d And every now and then, you go back for a post and see one of the things he said, like, \u201cOh, shit. Wow. Look. There he is. There is a little bit of Isaac.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20269\">INTERVIEWER: Mm, mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026B\">RESPONDENT: And everyone was angry in their own way, some off and on \u2013 suicide victims. And they\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m so angry. I\u2019m so angry.\u201d And Ed, who loved Isaac, just went on. He was like, \u201cAnd it pisses me off he had such a weakness and cowardice.\u201d And I came back just very calmly with, \u201cYou\u2019ve got <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2026B1\">it completely backwards. The will to survive is incredibly strong.\u201d Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026D\">INTERVIEWER: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026F\">RESPONDENT: \u201cYou need real effort, determination, and strength to overcome that and kill yourself. And, really, if someone doesn\u2019t want to be here, then who the fuck are we to tell them they have to stay?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20271\">INTERVIEWER: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20273\">RESPONDENT: And that was the end of the thread. I ran into Ed a year later, in the south, and he was like, \u201cHey, Fred. It is OK, and fuck you for being right.\u201d I was like, \u201cI know.\u201d It hurts but that is honest. We grieve. Isaac doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. I\u2019m happy for Isaac because Isaac doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20275\">INTERVIEWER: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20277\">RESPONDENT: He didn\u2019t want to be here. And it hurt him to be here. I mean, who the fuck would we be to make him stay? It is like, \u201cI realize your life is suffering and pain, but we prefer that you still exist.\u201d Sure, maybe we\u2019d prefer it. Who knows what Isaac would have gone on to have done, what sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202771\">of potential that was there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20279\">But, really, nothing matters because he killed himself.

If it gets too much, there is a door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028B\">INTERVIEWER: Well, yeah.

And Ginny cried and cried and cried because she said she would be so angry at me, because it would mean I didn\u2019t care, and she doesn\u2019t want to be angry at me for the rest of her life. And I tried to explain. I\u2019m like, \u201cIt is not about you. All right?\u201d It is not about me caring or not <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2028D1\">caring; that is not something that even figures into the equation. Suicide is when you want the pain to stop, when that is the only thing on your mind. You can\u2019t \u2013 there is this great bit in Buffy the Vampire Slayer where people get turned into vampires, and people that you used to know and love become <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2028D2\">vampires and blah-blah-blah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028F\">And people are like, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t kill him.

And that is the thing \u2013 when you look at [pauses] a dead friend in there probably a closed coffin or casket \u2013 you\u2019re not seeing them; you\u2019re seeing what killed them. [Pauses] And what killed them was something that was completely and totally in pain, and saw nothing else, and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202931\">seeing such a thing for so long that it had worn down all the various barriers that prevented one from doing such a thing. They just wanted to pain to stop. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20295\">Our pain doesn\u2019t last as long as it used to; it comes and goes as it flows.

And they\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, my God, please don\u2019t kill yourself.\u201d Jesus Christ, it is not like I\u2019m doing this because of \u2013 because of or for you, or about you, or with any consideration of you. Right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202991\">Jesus Christ. Someone tweets the Bloggess [ph] that a friend of hers killed himself. She is like, \u201cA friend of mine killed himself. People, we lost one to depression. Please, please remind everyone of the damage left behind when\u2026\u201d What a fucking stupid thing to say. And I didn\u2019t tell her that because, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202992\">obviously, she was in pain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029B\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029D\">RESPONDENT: Right?
