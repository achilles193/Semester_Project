That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">one thing.

And I\u2019m going to have to move again and then I\u2019ll have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">move again and again and again.

I feel better walking around, and now what used to be a ten minute walk from the\u2026 my place <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">to the T ended up, well, five minutes plus waiting forever for the pedestrian light but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Wow.

[7:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I do. I determine what I deserve based on societal feelings and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What would you need to do to deserve to be happy in your view?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Get a job and actually be able to support myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s work toward that. Rather than thinking about how you can save your parents money by ending your life, which seems really extreme to me, let\u2019s focus on getting healthier, getting more active, getting more in control. Those are things you can have some say over. You\u2019ve dedicated some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">time to going swing dancing and walking and being more active, and you\u2019re seeing a difference. Not in weight but you\u2019re seeing a difference in your health. If you can walk the same distance faster than you used to be able to that\u2019s an improvement in your health. [8:18] And it\u2026 and you said it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200712\">good. These are important markers.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561909\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: If I don\u2019t lose weight I\u2019m not going to stop being pre-diabetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Not necessarily the case. Ask your doctor to show you the research on activity and its impact on diabetes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: You can be healthy, you can improve your health, at any size. Being active, having an active\u2026 having movement in your days, that\u2019s healthy, no matter what the scale says. You have control over that. You have control over how active you are. You don\u2019t have control over your weight. And what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">we know about diet and exercise programs is that most people tend to cycle. Some people lose weight on them; lots of people lost weight on them, some people\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: And then as soon as they stop it comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: May come back. But what we also know is that the more active you are, the healthier you are. Measure health not in terms of how many pounds somebody weighs but you measure health in terms if somebody\u2019s insulin levels, insulin reactivity, blood pressure, VO2 max, which is how you measure how <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">you\u2019re using air. Those things are actually measures of health. [9:40] How much you weigh is only a measure of your size. So if we focus on bringing health into your life that usually improves mental health as well as your physical health. And if you want to see research on that stuff, because I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">you like to know where your facts are coming from, you can look that stuff up. You can also ask your doctor about the impact of activity levels on diabetes and prediabetic states. There\u2019s lots of stuff out there on that. The reason we want people to exercise is because it\u2019s the exercise that\u2019s actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D3\">good for you. Sometimes that results in lost weight, too, but it\u2019s not\u2026 weight loss isn\u2019t what makes you healthier. It\u2019s the improved exercise that makes you healthier. And it\u2019s good for depression, which clearly you\u2019re really feeling because when the thoughts that you\u2019re having seem really logical <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D4\">to you, that shows me that you\u2019re pretty depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Or maybe we just have to forget the definitions of logical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m willing to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: It makes financial sense. Even if they had to pay for my funeral that would be less than two month\u2019s rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Life value is not measured in finances. If it was, nobody would ever have kids. Kids are very expensive. People go on\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Only\u2026 I mean if they were in a Gregorian [sp?] society or something they would have kids. [11:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: But we\u2019re not, right. It doesn\u2019t make financial self\u2026 sense to have children in today\u2019s society for the majority of where people live in the United States. People in cities keep having children because they value life not just money. You\u2019re somebody who\u2026 you don\u2019t place a huge value on money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">Look at the livelihood that you\u2019re pursuing and the education that you\u2019ve pursued.

[crying]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s focus on what we can do now so that there\u2019s choices that you and your parents can make in the future. [12:36] If you kill yourself then there\u2019s no choices that anybody else gets to make. You don\u2019t get to make any more choices in the future; they don\u2019t have any say over it. But there <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">may be ways that you and they both get choices. But you have to be able to keep yourself safe in order to give yourself other choices, and to give them choices about how they retire or when and how much they support you and how much they support themselves. What do you really want?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. [crying] I don\u2019t know. Maybe to have a job and be thin and pretty. And to not have to ever listen to my parents again. And to not feel like a complete and total failure all the time. [crying] It does feel like that, though, because I am a failure and I\u2019m so stupid for choosing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">this field because there aren\u2019t any jobs in it. And okay, I didn\u2019t need something that pays $600,000 a year but I shouldn\u2019t have chose something that wasn\u2019t so oversaturated. [14:13] I mean I guess I didn\u2019t realize how oversaturated it was when I went in but it\u2019s so oversaturated that it\u2019s just [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200932\">Now I can\u2019t get another job as anything else or unless it\u2019s something related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s feeling pretty hopeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think [inaudible] doing something that made $13 an hour [inaudible] be better but it wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay my rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: And have your parents said that you need to be completely self-sufficient, be able to cover all your own expenses?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: No, but they haven\u2019t said that I don\u2019t either. (pause) I just really don\u2019t want to talk to them right now. I really don\u2019t want to talk to them. [15:27] I\u2019d like to avoid talking to them if at all possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I can understand, after having a really unpleasant dinner with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, [inaudible] how bad it was. She was the one\u2026 she\u2019s like you don\u2019t have a job either. But I\u2019ve already told you that. I told her that when I was\u2026 when we were down in Connecticut cat sitting. I told her that so many times. And then she has to be on and on and it doesn\u2019t matter because she <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">doesn\u2019t remember it, but I remember it. [crying] I don\u2019t want to be around my grandma ever again either. She\u2019s too much of a pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry it was so hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to keep on being judged. I\u2019m sick of being judged. And if I die then I won\u2019t be judged anymore. I mean I guess I will be judged but I won\u2019t know about it anymore. I won\u2019t have to deal with anyone\u2019s judgmentalness ever again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: How do you think your parents would feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: I think they\u2019d be relieved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not a typical response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not a typical person.

Sad and relieved. And they won\u2019t have to worry about me anymore. It\u2019s not my fault they waited so long in their life before having me. They waited until they were married for ten years and in their thirties, so of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">course I\u2019m totally going to be starting out when they\u2019re getting towards retiring. And you used to be able to get all these jobs by just having a\u2026 actually if you were just having a high school degree, and now you have to do so much more to be successful so it takes longer. I don\u2019t know anyone else <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF2\">who\u2019s\u2026 okay, I know one other person who hit thirty without ever having a real job and that was Ivan. But Ivan wasn\u2019t really trying to apply himself or anything and dropped out before his last semester of college because of money but\u2026 and never pursued trying to finish that degree by transferring to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF3\">something like community college or something cheaper. And as far as I know now he\u2019s still just living at his mom\u2019s place and helping out on the farm. And writing a book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Does he deserve to live? [18:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well he\u2019s not costing his parents\u2026 his mom that much money because he\u2019s living there so\u2026 maybe it is up to him and his mom. I think so. And people expected more of me and now I\u2019m just dashing everybody\u2019s expectations by being a complete failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: So you feel like you\u2019re disappointing people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s just [inaudible] so hard now to get a job that has health insurance and benefits because nobody wants to give out those jobs anymore. And people just want to make all the money and they don\u2019t care about giving their workers a fair wage. No one cares. And it just seems so illicit <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">[sp?] and\u2026 to get a job like that and I think I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What did you apply for on Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: I applied for one position at RPI that had been up for a month, but I checked the site and it was still there. I probably didn\u2019t\u2026 and I actually had to\u2026 there was one\u2026 I was mostly qualified at some point in the questions. One of the qualifications was extensive knowledge in database software <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">or something like that that I\u2019m like well, I could learn that. [20:14] And for qualification it was fine except then they had a questionnaire. You had to answer these five questions and\u2026 do you have this degree and etc., etc. And the fifth question was do I have that knowledge that I don\u2019t have that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB2\">I figured if I answered no that would automatically screen me out so I answered yes to it. But I don\u2019t, in my cover letter or resume, say that I have this experience so it will mean\u2026 that won\u2019t get me into a lot of trouble. But so late in the game that they\u2019re probably not going to do it. And do anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB3\">And then the other thing I applied to was\u2026 there\u2019s this architectural\u2026 actually the guy who built Yale Hillel is\u2026 built a lot of very, very beautiful and impractical buildings for Jewish agencies, but his architecture firm is looking for an employee who\u2026 to\u2026 I guess they have some collections. And again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB4\">I\u2019m not sure that they\u2019re bringing them here or something. I forget what it was but it was something that I was actually qualified for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: So I applied for it and it had only been posted two days prior or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561909\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Good for you for putting your name in and getting your stuff in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll matter much, and I just\u2026 I don\u2019t even have the space that I could be trying to dye yarn or something that I feel like getting some income in. There\u2019s nothing I can do right now. [22:02] And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get hired for retail without retail experience, or without\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: More recent\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: More recent retail experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, hard to know. Since you\u2019ve been feeling so badly and I know Sydney is concerned, I certainly feel concerned after hearing what you\u2019ve been feeling the past couple of days, I\u2019d like to make some time to make some concrete plans about how you know you can keep yourself safe and I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">you can keep yourself safe. And if we can\u2019t do those things then I think we do need to, regardless of the cost, figure out where you can go to be safe. And you do have health insurance coverage. I don\u2019t know exactly what the coverage is for either an intensive outpatient program or inpatient, but the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C92\">priority really is you being safe so that you can go on to be healthier. I can\u2019t allow the priority to be money savings. And I think if I were to have a conversation with your parents, which I won\u2019t break your confidentiality in that way, I won\u2019t do, but based on the way they\u2019ve responded to other things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C93\">yes, money is a concern, but your life is worth more. There\u2019s a big difference between them deciding to pay for an apartment and treatment. So if your health insurance coverage didn\u2019t cover a treatment that you needed, my sense from previous experience is they would be willing to pay for that. But let\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C94\">think about how you can keep yourself safe and feel that Sydney, who\u2019s with you a lot of the time, feels comfortable. Because it sounds like, from him telling you that you really need to talk about this today, it sounds like he felt uncomfortable. [23:58] So what are your\u2026 what do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: I have no idea what am I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to hurt myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: How could you be sure of that? Can you be sure of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Do you have any access to something that would kill you at home? Any firearms?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I have no firearms. I mean you know that I have the Desipromine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I know that you have the meds, yeah. How much do you have at home right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: One bottle that was recently filled, so probably more than 20 and less than 30 pills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Could you give some to Sydney to hold onto for you so that it\u2019s split up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Will you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: He probably would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s one step to keep yourself safer. I know that you sometimes\u2026 you didn\u2019t report today that you thought about taking too many meds but sometimes you reported that in the past. Is that something that you\u2019re thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Not right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019m glad to hear that. [25:27] Is there anything worth living for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Maybe my kitten, but I feel like he\u2019d be better off if he had a new home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Adjust to somebody new?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, but he has ringworm and I\u2019m afraid that we\u2019re not doing enough for him. And it\u2019s my fault that it got worse. And if he were in someone else\u2019s home they\u2019d take care of it. It wouldn\u2019t have spread all over his face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: What would you need to do to take better care of him?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561909\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: Well the thing is we washed the sheets and stuff but we haven\u2019t sanitized every single thing in the house because\u2026 and I\u2019m not sure if that really need to sanitize things is because of him getting more ringworm or if it\u2019s because\u2026 I think the reason why is because the concern that I\u2019ll get infected, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">which I feel like probably would\u2019ve happened by now if it was going to happen. And I\u2019m doing\u2026 taking some precautions but I don\u2019t know if the ringworm spreading more is my fault or if it\u2019s just that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going. I think the fact that it\u2019s growing on his head is probably not from getting more <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF2\">reinfected or that would\u2026 you\u2019d probably see it appear in other places too. That\u2019s probably just the topical stuff isn\u2019t strong enough for it. [26:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Maybe a call to the vet will answer those questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: Well I took him to the vet this morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, we\u2019re getting the\u2026 there\u2019s an oral medication that we\u2019re going to pick up sometime after five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Oh, so it sounds like you are taking steps to take care of your pet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah I am. I mean I took him to the vet on Thursday and that\u2019s when I got the ringworm diagnosis and started with the topical stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it sounds like you are taking good care of him. He\u2019s got this infection but you took him in, you took him back today, and he\u2019s relying on you to take care of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe someone else\u2026 and maybe a place where he had a second kitten to play with because he only has me and Sydney to play with right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Lots of cats don\u2019t have a cat friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: It\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s an adult cat but when it\u2019s a kitten it\u2019s really cruel and selfish to adopt him by himself. But I didn\u2019t have space for two cats, so I shouldn\u2019t have adopted him in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: All cats should be adopted\u2026 all kittens should be adopted in pairs? Is that the recommendation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, well or have another cat at home to play with. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the official recommendation but when I was at the pet store the day before I picked him up I was mentioning how\u2026 getting a new kitten, and the person there was all like oh you really should get two of them. One will <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">wear you out and stuff. [28:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Ah, one will wear you out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah I think [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: She was trying to sell you a second cat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Well I wasn\u2019t buying it from her, I was\u2026 the pet shop had adult cats but she wasn\u2019t trying to sell me one of her cats. She was trying to get me to adopt a second kitten, which I don\u2019t have space for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you don\u2019t have space for that. So it sounds like but what you do have is time to spend with the kitten. And you don\u2019t have to get worn out and it doesn\u2019t have to be alone for long portions of the day. You have time that you can spend. And it sounds like you\u2019re being attentive. Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">think about what you can do to be a really good pet owner rather than thinking about getting a different pet owner. Your job is to take care of you and to take care of this pet that relies on you right now. Why don\u2019t we make an appointment for Wednesday because it seems like you\u2019re having a really tough <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201112\">time right now and you\u2019ve\u2026 you don\u2019t have a plan to hurt yourself. It does sound like you\u2019re having thoughts of lots of hopelessness. And if you can split up your meds so that next time Sydney goes home he takes home some of the extras that you don\u2019t need in the next couple of days. It sounds like you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201113\">can be safe at home, and I\u2019d like to keep you that way and keep you working toward health.
