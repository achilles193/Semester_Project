Had a\u2026last Tuesday I had a breakdown at work where I was fine in the morning. I was fine for most of the afternoon. And then towards the end of the last like hour that I was working, I started like shaking. And then I realized that I was panicking. I was able to hide this from <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">everybody, but ended up, you know, leaving an hour early, which, I mean, isn\u2019t that abnormal for me, especially because [inaudible \u2013 00:45] right now hurts my hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">But I ended up going to my parents place first because I didn\u2019t know that I would be able to make it all the way back to Sydney, you know, New Haven. And so I ended up calling Dr. Barnes. Decided like, she called me back and so he put me back on the Seroquel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">[01:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s unusual for you to panic at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I know. That\u2019s when I realized it was like, it wasn\u2019t just the apartment or something because I don\u2019t normally panic at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So do you notice a difference already in being back on the Seroquel? Is it just Tuesday like yesterday Tuesday, or a week ago Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: A week ago Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So I\u2019ve been on for a week. I mean I think it helps some. I was panic free for a few days and then the past couple of days I\u2019ve been so like sad again and suicidal again. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been suicidal all along. Like for the past few weeks. But not as suicidal as I was when I was not on the Seroquel. So I think it\u2019s helping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: The past few days, what, when you say suicidal, what does that really mean? How long have the thoughts been, what level have the thoughts been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Was more like I was kind of really sad, but usually like not that long. But they weren\u2019t just like instant and go away. They were like maybe like five minutes or so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a really uncomfortable five minutes. It can feel like a really long time when you\u2019re feeling that sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">[02:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: This morning, I just sort of realized that because it was my birthday and Sydney was\u2026we stayed up late the night before, like we were going to go out and do this and then he like couldn\u2019t go to sleep, and like, you know. He didn\u2019t bother taking an Ambien or you know, Nyquil or whatever and like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">he knew it was my birthday. So then he was like sleeping in and [inaudible \u2013 03:19] don\u2019t even get up. Like I didn\u2019t get up until 10:30 and he didn\u2019t get up until like 11:00. And I guess it\u2019s not that late, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">[03:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: You felt disappointed, clearly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m not seeing any friends because I don\u2019t have a place to host them. Like I don\u2019t. My apartment\u2019s too small. [Tearful.] So I can\u2019t ever have a party and I haven\u2019t done things with friends in like forever and it made me really sad. And I feel like I have no friends because Sydney is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">like, why don\u2019t you just have a couple over. And I\u2019m like if I did, the couple that I\u2019d want to have would be Lucy and Walter, but they\u2019re, you know, they moved to Florida like a year and a half ago now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: And you miss them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just don\u2019t feel like I have any close friends anymore and I just couldn\u2019t think of any way. And Sydney was like, oh well, you know. First he was like trying to help, but then I shot down his idea and then he got mad at me. And he was like, okay, I quit. And I\u2019m like thanks. Like it just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">feels so hopeless and I was considering like, I didn\u2019t go in to work yesterday either because I was sick on Monday and yesterday I, like Monday night, I was feeling really suicidal and bad and depressed and I guess it wasn\u2019t\u2026maybe I wasn\u2019t even suicidal. It was like the physical feeling of uncomfortableness <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">and tightness from anxiety. That\u2019s what I was feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561887\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">[04:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I was feeling. So there wasn\u2019t a thought, at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: There might have been\u2026there was possibly a thought about like I should kill myself to end this feeling. And the feeling wouldn\u2019t go away. I mean yesterday there was snow anyways, but like I\u2019m this close to finishing my job and I\u2019m like considering quitting right before the end when like, except <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">that would have me leave on bad terms, but I just don\u2019t know that I could keep it together enough. And if I keep on feeling like this, like that tightness just wasn\u2019t going away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: So that tightness is really uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I can sort of put it away like if were doing like something distracting like watching an episode of something or like listening to a podcast. But as soon as like the episode or podcast or whatever ends, it comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: And it doesn\u2019t go away at work, or it didn\u2019t on that last Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Well, it wasn\u2019t the tightness; it was like last Tuesday it was shaking. I don\u2019t remember there being that tightness at work. Maybe there was. I\u2019m just so uncomfortable and I have no way of like going like, making it go away permanently. It just seems hopeless and I\u2019m just like, okay, these drugs <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">aren\u2019t stopping that feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">[06:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling that tightness now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: So it doesn\u2019t feel like you have any control over it, but it does go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: It does go away, but I feel like I have no control over it. It\u2019s happening. If it happens more and more, and like if the Seroquel isn\u2019t going to help either then like, I mean I guess I it\u2019s helping some, but it\u2019s not helping enough. And like I can\u2019t, you know, I don\u2019t know if the Imipramine <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">has stopped working or something and I can\u2019t really go back on Wellbutrin because it\u2019s really bad for anxiety. And I\u2019m just like\u2026I\u2019ve run out of options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s give the Seroquel some more time to work. You\u2019ve been on it for a week. It sounds like it\u2019s helping a little. Let\u2019s see what happens. How has things like, I know it\u2019s been snowy. Have you been able to exercise at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: No, I haven\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Because that\u2019s sometimes, you know, when that\u2019s more available to you, that can really help because the tightness is muscles. Right. That\u2019s a muscle tightening that you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s really uncomfortable. It\u2019s not dangerous, but it\u2019s really uncomfortable. And that\u2019s something that exercise <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">can really help with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">[07:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: But how am I supposed to like\u2026usually it happens like at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s not necessarily that it\u2019s just something that helps in the moment, but when you\u2019re more active, that can lower the baseline. The way to discharge some of this energy that\u2019s right now being translated in to anxiety and tension, and all of the good health care, self-care things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">you do, like getting regular sleep, exercising on a regular basis, they lower the baseline anxiety. So it\u2019s not something; yes, it can help in the moment if you\u2019re starting to feel really anxious and it\u2019s a time when you can get out an exercise, it can add that distraction component in a moment. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F2\">if you\u2019re able to engage in a little bit of activity every day, that helps all the time. Just to lower the overall anxiety, to discharge some of that energy, to get endorphins flowing that counteract some of this other stuff you\u2019re feeling. The exercise can be a mood lift and an anxiety prevention technique <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F3\">that works across the board. And it\u2019s been something that\u2019s been really hard for you to access, so it\u2019s not working for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561887\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">[08:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so snowy out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been a rough winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Like I have to wait for it to stop being snowy. Like I\u2019m okay with walking in the cold, but like not really walking like in the snow. And like right now it\u2019s just so slippery out. Like even getting to the car to get here was like a challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">[09:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s definitely more challenging. It\u2019s been a rough winter for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I feel like I probably can\u2019t wait until the end of winter to like start exercising, but I don\u2019t really have any other choices. Like maybe I\u2019ll get [inaudible \u2013 09:30] because then I could have time and then I could join a gym or something or like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Or go someplace indoors. Like even just doing laps in a mall. Right. You think about, I know we talked last time about thinking creatively about how to navigate some of the challenges. People do still exercise in the winter. And whether that be driving someplace and doing laps in a mall or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">finding a clear path. You get creative, you can find ways to overcome some of the challenges so that you don\u2019t have to put doing something good for yourself on hold so long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Like laps of running or laps of walking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Walking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Okay, because running in the mall\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: You can walk laps around any indoor space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I think the winter is driving me crazy. Just hearing like, you know, when I find out there\u2019s going to be more snow it just makes me so sad and\u2026 [Tearful.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t deal with winter anymore, but there\u2019s really nothing I, you know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">[10:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: That one\u2019s out of your control.

And now with the babies, if you get too close to the babies or look at the babies, she\u2019ll attack you. And she actually moved them, like she had them in the a playpen area that she liked took the kittens out and moved them to like underneath <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B2\">the hope chest that had been like fenced off where they weren\u2019t supposed to be going. But I mean it\u2019s a safe place for now. But like I think sometimes she\u2019s been less crazy. But like she managed to bite in to my mom\u2019s hand to the point like it got swollen and like she had to go to the doctor and they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B3\">gave her medicine which wasn\u2019t like, instead of like it hadn\u2019t done enough yet and rather than wait and see if the medicine would work, they want to give her the option of either going to the hospital or getting an IV that she can have at home. And so she has the IV until Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">[13:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: So I need to help her cook. So not really a chance for a walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, one way to do it is to think about, I know a long way back we thought about instead of thinking about doing that concentrated exercise, just how to build a little bit more movement or activity in to the day. So it sounds like you\u2019re going to be, you know, like parking at work, parking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">at the doctor\u2019s office\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Park a little bit further away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Work, I can\u2019t really do that because it\u2019s just like there is the parking garage and then I have the pass to, and that\u2019s my free parking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so choose a spot that\u2019s the longest walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: And then it\u2019s just, you know, so you get a couple of minutes, maybe there. Same thing at the doctor\u2019s office. It\u2019s supposed to be warmer on Friday. You know, a safe spot, but a little bit further away. Don\u2019t pick the one that\u2019s closest to the door. Pick the one that\u2019s safe, but farthest away <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">from the door and give yourself an extra couple of minutes at each spot. And that can build in, you know. Just 10 minutes of walking during the day, just by doing a couple of things like that. And that\u2019s a manageable way, you know, to be able to walk in places that probably have been plowed. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">they\u2019re going to plow the parking lot. The parking garage is covered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">[15:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And gives you just a few minutes of being a little bit more active; maybe a little bit of fresh air here and there. That\u2019s a way that you can be more in control of what you\u2019re able to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: I think I can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: That sounds manageable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: It just doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s going to be enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not enough forever. But it\u2019s what you can fit in these couple of days so that instead of seeing all the options that are closed to you, it\u2019s the option that you can take these couple of days. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: I want to go on walks. I really do. Just drudging through the snow with my snow boots and things being slippery, I hate it so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561887\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: But I really should, at least, be taking the stairs instead of the elevator at my place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Have you been doing that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: No, it depends. Sometimes on the way down, not usually on the way up, especially if I\u2019m like carrying heavy stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: What do you choose here? Did you use the elevator or the stairs here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Depends on the day, but usually the elevator on the way up and usually the stairs on the way down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: So what about choosing the stairs on the way up too? Is that something you feel like you could do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: I guess it depends on what I have on. When I had on\u2026the day that I had my backpack and my computer, like I guess I could of. I just was afraid I was going to hurt my back like carrying it up the stairs. I don\u2019t carry that much on me I could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: What floor is your apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s on the\u2026it\u2019s on the third floor, but the ground floor is one, so it\u2019s two; two flights up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">[17:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: So those are ways to look for little bits more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Maybe on days when you\u2019re not carrying as heavy of a load, choosing the stairs up on the way. Choosing the stairs up as well as choosing the stairs down are little ways for you to take control of where you can get in just a little bit more movement in your day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">I think one of the things that work when looking for is not how to make huge changes, but places where you can feel les trapped, because I think that feeling, that tightening in your chest and that I want to escape, and sometimes that translates to like I should kill myself to stop this. Those are\u2026it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">seems to me that those all come from feeling like you don\u2019t have any choices and that you\u2019re trapped. And you know, that can be from, you know, all these snow storms feel like they\u2019re kind of trapping, the small apartment feels like it\u2019s trapping, you know, not knowing what your job options are going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD2\">to be kind of leaves you feeling trapped financially. So the more places we can look for like well what are\u2026what are the little choices that you can make? Maybe you can\u2019t change the whole situation, but there might be some changes you can make within that so it doesn\u2019t feel so much like you\u2019re backed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD3\">in to a corner without any options whatsoever. It sounds like that\u2019s kind of what kind of happened with your birthday too. You can\u2019t, you don\u2019t have a space where you feel like you can invite everybody over for a party, so it felt like you had no options. And when Sydney tried to give you a suggestion, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD4\">it didn\u2019t feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: No, it really didn\u2019t. I mean he was like oh we can take \u2013because we still have some boxes like my parents came up over the weekend and helped, but I still have some boxes and don\u2019t really have a place to put them. So it would have been too hard to move everything out in time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">[19:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: So if you got creative, what could be a choice that you could make? That doesn\u2019t feel like a choice, having people over. But is there something else you could do? Maybe to celebrate belatedly on another day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Probably yes. [Tearful.] Go out to a restaurant or maybe if someone else really tells me. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like any of my friends suggested getting together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Would you like to invite somebody to a restaurant?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561887\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Maybe. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m sort of\u2026I feel a little bit uncomfortable with that because then it\u2019s like, you know, suggesting an activity that people have to spend money on. I mean, which I guess is okay, and also like pending whether or they eat kosher, and that\u2019s going to be an issue. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">most of my friends don\u2019t\u2026possibly all of my friends, they can [inaudible \u2013 20:57] of at least like dairy food out in a restaurant, or non-kosher restaurant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: That may be a way to acknowledge your birthday. And if you frame it, you know, as like, you know, would you like to come have\u2026go out to dinner together so that it doesn\u2019t imply that you\u2019re hosting the whole thing. But people can go out to dinner and each pay and that\u2019s a way for you to acknowledge <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">your birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">[21:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I feel like I\u2019ve lost touch with all my friends because I have. Who would you like to reach out to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: It seems like it\u2019s important to connect again with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. Maybe like Philip and Aimee. Maybe like [inaudible \u2013 22:15]. I haven\u2019t actually like gone and rejoined [inaudible \u2013 22:28] yet. And it feels weird that if I were doing it, like, you know, right after I got like\u2026if I\u2019m going to make Sunday my first rehearsal, like being like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">hey, let\u2019s all get dinner like before rehearsal so that people that like\u2026I mean I know most of the people in the group right now. I think they only have like three new members. But still, a little bit weird suggesting it when I haven\u2019t actually rejoined the group yet. Because like the following weekend <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F72\">I won\u2019t actually be able to come to rehearsal, so I\u2019m like do I want to start when I can\u2019t make all the rehearsals yet, which is silly in a way because, actually, like the\u2026like even if I\u2019m only going to have rehearsals for now, that\u2019s still more rehearsals than if I wait to get back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">[23:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: So also just afraid of the time commitment and stuff. But if I\u2019m going to be unemployed again, it\u2019s not going to be that bad. And if I can get a reasonable job, that like is around here, you know, I could, you know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Will it be time that, you know, enjoy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah. Actually in that, now that more hours [inaudible \u2013 23:49] any more. I think there isn\u2019t any\u2026you know, all the drama is gone. Like all the dramatic people finally left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it might feel good to get together with the group. It might feel good to sing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m just afraid. I don\u2019t want to be like a [inaudible \u2013 24:19] and stuff. And like I\u2019ll have to miss, like next weekend I have an event and then like there are the two weeks that I\u2019m house sitting for my parents while they\u2019re in Israel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Those are things that are all setup before you decided to rejoin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: I mean if it seems like if you\u2019re upfront with the leaders, that you know, you\u2019ve got these commitments already, but you\u2019d like to rejoin\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">[24:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Talk with them.

He\u2019ll probably call the, my doctor\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: I mean there are two things going on socially. One is that you\u2019ve, you know, feel sad to you that you haven\u2019t planned something to acknowledge your birthday. It\u2019s a very noticeable moment of having disconnected from your friends. So maybe that\u2019s not, you know, something that you involve the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201151\">[music25:27] people in. But you\u2019ve also noticed that you\u2019ve really disconnected from your friends and you have missed being part of a group and the music piece fits that. So maybe reaching out to Philip and Aimee about getting together for dinner and acknowledging your birthday. That works on one <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201152\">piece. And talking to the music people about whether it would make sense to start now and sort of piece meal a way because of these other commitments and seeing if you can reconnect with that group and enjoy getting back in touch with that part of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561887\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: I guess I can do that.

And I was like, oh God, I have to face him at rehearsal. I\u2019m just going to play video games instead.

This is not signing up for lifetime membership. If it turns out that it\u2019s harmful in some way, then you stop. If it\u2019s useful, if you enjoy it, that\u2019s probably a good thing. If you reconnect with some people you enjoy, those things tend to be good at treating <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201331\">depression. You know, getting involved with activities that are pleasurable. That\u2019s good stuff. And it might be that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">And if it feels like it\u2019s too much of a pressure right now, you say, you know, I\u2019m sorry; I realize it\u2019s too much of a time commitment right now.

Especially, you know, now that I don\u2019t have anyone making me dinner anymore. Being able to do that all myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, to be responsible for that for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m also afraid that like, you know, now I\u2019m starting to feel like older than all the people in the group and if that\u2019s going to be an issue. Right now, if I come back, I wouldn\u2019t be the oldest member of the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: And how does the age become an issue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: Well, you know, it would be\u2026we\u2019re a college acapella group. You know like at a certain point, like, you know, if I was like, you know 35 and people are looking very teen like, it would look weird to have this older person in this group that\u2019s presumably college students, or college students and grad students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Are they sort of upset by your age?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: No. So I guess it\u2019s not an issue now. We actually did have someone else who was older, though he left after a year because he was involved in like a [inaudible \u2013 32:18] stuff. And I think it was\u2026I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to come back to the group. So if he came back, I wouldn\u2019t be the oldest one anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">[32:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like the group is not worried about it, certainly not at your age now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: No. Sometimes they worry about like not having enough undergrads for getting funding and being classified as a certain type of Stanford group, but they don\u2019t want to kick out grad students either. Just more like recruiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So rather than look for reasons why it might not be good now or might not be good in the future, I wonder what stops you from letting yourself kind of give it a try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s the depression is what stops me. The anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Your job is for you to be in control and not let the anxiety and depression be in control. Anxiety and depression impact you, but you don\u2019t have to let it control you. So I know that it\u2026those are the things that are talking right now as you think about what could go wrong or why it might <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D1\">not work in your life; that\u2019s the anxiety and depression talking. You can listen to those things, but then you make a choice that\u2019s good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">[34:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just hard to make all the right choices because it\u2019s so easy to like, you know, just sleep in. Like, you know, even on Monday morning, I had my game; like the alarm went off and we had like more time that we could sleep and I wanted to go back to sleep because I knew that if I stayed up <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201611\">for a certain amount of time, the tightness would come back, and then it did. You know, and sleep seems like the only escape from it. And I can\u2019t sleep all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">THERAPIST: No, you can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: But I choose sleep. So, I don\u2019t really know how to do anything. [Tearful.] My whole life is falling apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve got a lot of challenges right now, so let\u2019s just focus on one piece. Like you said, it\u2019s hard to make all of the right decisions, which sometimes feels harder to make. So let\u2019s take it just a couple of days at a time and focus on making one or two decisions that feel like they\u2019re towards health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">So it\u2019s Wednesday evening and you said you had some, you have some plans.

Let\u2019s focus on just one decision that feels like it\u2019s towards health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: I guess possibly going to music rehearsal on Sunday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">[36:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">THERAPIST: Okay. So then you set it up so that you can do that, and that\u2019s sort of the one step towards reaching back out to people, maybe getting engaged with something that would be positive. Does that feel doable or is that too big of a decision?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">CLIENT: Well, though, [inaudible \u2013 36:22] just a part of me now thinks I\u2019m making a huge mistake by wanting to join music again. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the depressed part of me or the sensible part of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">THERAPIST: Well, it could be either. Let\u2019s go with if it turns out to be a bad decision, this is a decision that could be undone. Right. So when you\u2019re thinking about killing yourself to escape, that\u2019s one that can\u2019t be undone. But joining music can. Pretty easily. Right. That\u2019s a smaller decision than <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201771\">moving out of your apartment. So it\u2019s a pretty safe one to take a gamble on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: I guess. I\u2019m so reluctant to do it now and I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re afraid. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s going to be work rather than enjoyable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s see what it is. And if it\u2019s work, then you back off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">CLIENT: Okay. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">[38:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">THERAPIST: How\u2019s the tightness now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like a little bit there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I saw that shaky breath, which I think is maybe part of what happened. Your chest gets really tight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like it\u2019s not as bad as it\u2019s like been the past few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m glad to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: See if you can take some really deep breaths. Let the oxygen do its work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: So what do I have the moment when I can\u2019t calm down and can\u2019t make the tightness go away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">THERAPIST: Remember that the tightness is not dangerous. That\u2019s the first piece. Right. It\u2019s that it\u2019s uncomfortable. That\u2019s not dangerous. I think remembering that is the first step. And you might not be able to make it go away, but it will go away eventually. You can try taking some deep breaths. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201951\">Sometimes that helps. I know in the past, sometimes when you try that it feels uncomfortable to focus on the breath. So if, you know, so you give it a try and take some deep breaths, and if that opens up your chest, you know, and just like I just did. I sat back. I put my shoulders back. That allows <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201952\">you to open up your chest a little bit. That can help. A lot of times, slowing down your breath can work to relax you a little bit; let your muscles relax. If you can\u2019t get it to go away, remember that it\u2019s going to go away eventually. It has never lasted forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">[39:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s always gone away eventually. And sometimes just knowing that it\u2019s going to end and it\u2019s uncomfortable. As it is, it\u2019s not harmful to you. You\u2019re safe. That can\u2026keeping those thoughts in mind can speed up the process of it going away because it\u2019s the anxious worried thoughts that keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B1\">you tight and anxious and worried. Some good distraction techniques \u2013 sometimes hopping into a warm shower if you can, you know, if you\u2019re at home and you can do that. You can try it if you have a heating pad, you can try putting a heating pad on your chest to relax the area. Sometimes just the sensation <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B2\">of warmth or pressure can help to distract you from the other sensations that you\u2019re feeling. Like you can really only feel one thing at a time, either pressure or temperature. The nerve endings are the same, so sometimes if you kind of confuse your body by giving it a new temperature, it starts to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B3\">not really notice the pressure as much. So can this be a way, I mean you can feel both at the same time, but if you can wait, it sort of distracts you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2019A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561887\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">So you can try some of those things, but it will go away.

And it\u2019s even a better option than worrying about it. I know that you\u2019ve always told me that when <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB1\">you have those thoughts that you\u2019re not thinking about actually following through on them. Rather than engaging in that cycle of thought for five minutes, if it\u2019s not night time, take a nap. That\u2019s better than\u2026it\u2019s better than engaging in a cycle of destructive thought. And maybe it will be better when <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB2\">you wake up, or maybe one of those other techniques can work and you can get some control over it. And I would try those first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">[42:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">CLIENT: I have a heating pad.
