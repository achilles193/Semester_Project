(Long pause) [0:04:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">It just seems like there's no good way out of this.

The sort of-I don't know-pain and horror and feeling trapped and the fear that you felt starting yesterday afternoon I gather, except for being asleep, that you felt until now. At the same time, (pause) there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">some things that are a little suspicious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: You do seem to have pretty thoroughly forgotten, and I imagine maybe unconsciously gotten rid of, how you felt-let me-for example on Friday-other times, too, but that was just the time we talked about it, so-which was considerably better and also since the beginning of last week, very cautiously <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">and very warily hopeful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I don't think what's going on now is just that you are feeling like, \"Oh, shit, I've kind of crashed again so the hopes I had were dashed.\" I don't think this is just that. That would seem reasonable to me, but I don't think that's what's going on, actually [inaudible 0:10:10] that. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">it's likely (pause) that you have actually kind of gotten rid of what that felt like altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I mean, this isn't like, \"Oh, things are going a bit better, but now I've had a setback so I'm kind of feeling worse about things and not as hopeful or optimistic as I was. I think this is like that's gone and the-I don't know quite what to call it-like the horror; the depression isn't quite <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">right-suicidality. The phrase that occurs to me is like, \"It is back with a vengeance\" I think. And it has obliterated what came before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was feeling hopeful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: I want that back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You may be punishing yourself for having felt it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Hm. Why would it [inaudible 0:11:39]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: I'm not saying that it's going to make you feel hopeful again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Um hm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But (pause) I think the model you kind of have of it, to the extent that you have a model at all, and the way it was kind of sounding to me last night was it was almost like it was quite biological.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098812\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Like, you know, or-that's not quite right. Like something like that though were once you're out of the environment of the hospital or whatever-like basically it would be more like this. These things just come over you. There is no rhyme or reason. They undo whatever could possibly be done <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">and the only imaginable way to feel any better is to be dead. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">Like it's the Plague. I mean, you get the Plague, you're fucked. Yeah, maybe like [inaudible 0:13:10] be in a hospital bed and to get some fluids or something, but basically, you get the Plague, you're fucked. You're dead now, you're dead later. You're going to suffer in the meantime and that's it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">There is really nothing to be done. My impression is that that's what it felt like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">But again, actually look at what has happened-that's not really what it looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: [inaudible 0:13:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: We don't know, ultimately, if the ECT is going to make a significant difference. I mean, it was, for a week and a half, it seems pretty clear-along with being in the hospital, that always makes a difference so it's hard to tell from what's what and hard to know how often these will come back. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">With ECT we don't know. But though there is uncertainty there, the intensity of your conviction that there is no real possible help ever is-I mean when I say it is a little [inaudible 0:14:35]. I imagine you know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (Long pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Moreover, this is something we've run into before, the feeling of a kind of inevitable and monolithic quality to the depression, especially the suicidality in a way that emerges later as like (pause)-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Not closer to quite adding up...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Or not quite fitting. Like, I guess, there have been times where it's before where it's very much felt that way and then we sort of look back at what's happened and there were actually clear precipitants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: And it doesn't make the horror of feeling this way any better, but it does sort of contextualize it a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: I think this has that, too. I think the context is probably like a kind of a guilty and vengeful reaction to feeling better, at least in part, or being taken care of. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You know, maybe-now I'm clearly on a roll here-maybe [chuckles] maybe-you know, you said when we talked on the phone that-you were talking about getting help and you said-this was after you were starting to feel a little bit better in the hospital-and you were like, \"Now I kind of feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">I have to leave. I feel a little better. I don't feel like I deserve it any more. I feel guilty about getting the help. I should just be out of here.\" And you said that in a kind of self-conscious way knowing that was still perfectly reasonable for you to be in the hospital, but I think you were saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B2\">\"Look, when I'm completely desperate I either don't care anymore or somehow it's okay to get the help. And then after I sort of am some little amount away from that\"-actually it wasn't a little amount. It was hard to remember feeling that way when you were out of it, but anyway, the point is once you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B3\">were feeling well enough to possibly not need that anymore it made you feel guilty to have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098812\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And...I don't know. Maybe this is a reaction to that guilt. Maybe you do feel guilty for ever getting it. You just sort of suspend that for awhile when things are really awful. And then when you feel better or you go home, it falls on you like a ton of bricks. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: And in this sort of thoroughly crushing way that obliterates your recollection of things having been better or whatever hope or optimism you may have had, however guarded or wary-(Long pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">And it is terrible, terrible, terrible that that happens to you.

I don't. I hope so, but I really-I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: You know, I intend to, but... (pause) The hopelessness is just-it's so convincing. (Pause) Yeah.

I mean, that is a genuine question. I'm not trying to set you up; I really want to know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: I don't know. (Long pause) It just feels like it clearly wasn't real. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Like you were probably taken in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: And I was probably taken in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Now you see it like it is? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(Pause) Is it almost like [inaudible 0:25:59] you, times that you were fooled into having hope made things worse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don't know. (Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Is it like you don't know how you're going to bear it for the minute, let alone for years to come. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: I can-I can do it for the next minute.

Just (pause) not much longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">(Long pause) It's just really grim. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: [Very long pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">I don't mean to be in any way critical of you saying this. I know you're working incredibly hard and that all this takes so much effort and takes so much out of you. But my thought at the moment is this is a little bit like when you saw a therapist as a kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: How so? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And you were terrified that the therapist would find out that you were depressed and wanted to, I guess, talk about anything but. And I kind of have a different-a thought of a different perspective on that which is (pause) that there was something very dangerous about the possibility of getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">the help that you were sort of desperate to protect yourself from. There's a layer of it which I guess I sort of assumed before and I thought was what you mean-that you were afraid that if you were labeled depressed that somehow that wouldn't turn out well for you. First of all, a therapist clearly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B32\">was not going to help. Second of all, there would be something bad for like your dad or your mom or whomever knowing this about you. So it could only go badly.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098812\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">And I guess what I'm imagining now is maybe there was something kind of more fundamental and sort of more terrifying about someone finding out how you really felt, what you really thought, what it was really like, that your being in a relationship with somebody who really knew those things about you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">was, for some reason-I kind of go through possibilities, but I'm not sure which it is-really danger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it feels like it but I don't know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, I mean, to be clear, I don't at all think you are sitting there like thinking all this stuff that you're consciously withholding from me. I don't have that impression. I think you've shared what comes to mind. But I do think that unconsciously you're pretty inhibited from thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">of things to say about what it's really like. In a context-you're not generally at a loss for words or ways of talking, thinking about, or describing things. So those things [inaudible 0:35:04]. I imagine that might be why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah [inaudible 0:35:23] about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It's okay. I mean, I imagine that level of-it probably makes you feel bad-we talk about that-but you really wish-like you probably feel like you're doing me a disservice-something [inaudible 0:35:40] before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: And maybe go back through some of what I don't know-or about yourself in some other way. Maybe you're terrified (pause) and feel like no good could possibly come from having more to say. .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: (Long pause) I'm afraid I'm not going to make it. (Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Um hm. (Pause) Do you ever want to feel what's going to happen? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: (Long pause) I'm afraid I'll kill myself [inaudible 0:39:11].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 0:39:14]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I don't know. Not really to get even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: But safe [ph 0:39:56].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: You just won't be able to [inaudible 0:40:05] things you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And you won't care so much about whatever courage it takes, but how bad things are hurting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It will just be [inaudible 0:40:29].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. It would be the best thing. (Pause) [inaudible 0:40:45] that. I never did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I remember. And you don't want to go back to the hospital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: No. I have to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I'm not asking because it's going to be your decision. I'm asking because I at least consider taking into account what you want. Could [inaudible 0:41:32] but, yeah. I mean, if you were saying, \"I would just feel so much better [inaudible 0:41:37] if I was back there\", I would think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">that. But you're, at the moment, saying you prefer to be home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So obviously you're quite scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And pretty hopeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Is there any plan for the day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: Um (Pause) I don't think I will (Long pause) [inaudible 0:42:23] the stuff, our stuff out of storage, so I'll have some unpacking to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">And I have a question about the ECT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: And you may not remember this, actually. Do you know when it's felt helpful and [inaudible 0:43:07] now it is not at all. It helped kind of soon after the treatment itself, or there was kind of a-<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098812\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: I think it-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: more like an SSRI where you just sort of build it up over time.

(Long pause) I guess my inclination is to send you home and ask you to leave me some kind of message a little later this afternoon to let me know where things are at.
