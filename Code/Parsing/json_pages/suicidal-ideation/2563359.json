We talked and that was good. I got home and I got the game, which made me feel bad. When I got home I basically opened it, saw the rule book, saw some of the cards with the rule book on top and walked away from it, because I didn\u2019t really deserve it yet. I went upstairs and I hooked <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">up socially on g-mail and was really hoping to hear something like \u201ca bunch of us came in anyway yesterday and we talked about coming in for a game\u201d or something.  I still didn\u2019t receive an e-mail today like \u201cwe\u2019d like to come in tonight and play some board games.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Tonight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: If it happens. I worry that it won\u2019t. Then, of course, the logical path that my brain follows \u2013 or what I call logic at the time \u2013 continues to return to \u201cwell, I should probably kill myself.\u201d I\u2019m looking at that screwdriver again thinking \u201chow can I do this?\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cThis is not normal. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">not supposed to be thinking these thoughts. These are irrational.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: The idea is to put the screwdriver to the carotid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, to push as far as you can to see how much it hurts before you actually have to put it through. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Do you have any fantasies about what that would do if you put it through?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It should puncture. Puncture wounds heal the fastest, which is unfortunate. However, there would be quite a force of blood that would begin quickly. There is a good chance I would bleed out. There is also a good chance I would try to save myself, clenching that wound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, just instinct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, hands fly towards danger. [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:26) It being a slower way to go, it gives you far more time to get past that moment and into the \u201coh, I want to live\u201d first. I fear it, as well, because if I try and I fail that\u2019s awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s even worse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Significantly worse because then you have to live with the consequences. If you try and succeed, then more power to you; unless, of course, there is some sort of hell. It seems unlikely, but I don\u2019t suppose there is, in which case we\u2019re all fucked from the beginning.  [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">at 00:03:02) has mentioned many times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Is there anything about cutting off the blood to the head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I know that\u2019 show you kill people. [Those are killing wounds.] (ph?) You knock someone out and if you hold it, you die. That\u2019s just want happens. Your blood needs to go to and from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It does. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: If you cut off one or the other, it\u2019s over. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What I\u2019m thinking is that one thing that sounds to me what I was imagining might be appealing, too, about it is that your mind wouldn\u2019t have to register all this stuff that you\u2019re going through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sure. I wouldn\u2019t have to think about that. So I\u2019m sitting there and thinking that these thoughts are irrational. I know they\u2019re not rational so I call my sister, Bridget, and I\u2019m talking to her telling her, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m feeling. This is what\u2019s been going on and I\u2019m getting more and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">more worked up.  I\u2019m going into a real rage and I\u2019m screaming that I don\u2019t want to be this way anymore. I slam my hands against the refrigerator and magnets fly everywhere. My little [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:11) runs up the stairs as fast as she can. I see the magnets everywhere and immediately go check <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">on my dog, Hank, who is just sitting up there literally trembling in fear, so I immediately have to stay, feel the dog, good, get control, and comfort him. I was very calm like everything is fine; not like \u201cWho\u2019s a good boy?\u201d because all that does is encourage him to be afraid. It\u2019s rewarding that kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D3\">of stuff like it\u2019s right; it\u2019s good to be afraid right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563359\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a confusing signal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. And dogs just feel anger as AOE blast. I don\u2019t know what AOE means. It\u2019s a term used in gaming that means area of effect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I got the tone of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: They can\u2019t distinguish between direct and indirect, or even if direct is something else. It made my sister cry a little bit and I had to go into care mode.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: How was that for her to cry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Because she knew. She knew what it was like. She\u2019s been through that. At the same time, this is what I do whenever I\u2019m in my rage and it just causes people to have negative reactions and I go and comfort that person. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. I\u2019m sorry. I seem to have affected you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel bad about it when you do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I feel responsible, as if now I must fix this. One of the magnets broke, the back to the magnet broke off the front of it. It was a crocodile in a Hawaiian shirt and a Ft. Lauderdale thing. I think he had sunglasses.  The magnetic part snapped off the back of the plastic part and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">that wasn\u2019t mine. This is the second time that, in anger, I\u2019ve destroyed something that was not mine.\u201d This is the third time in my life. The first time I was five. The second time was maybe a month-and-a-half ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I remember that. The shovel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: The shovel. The first time it was my little sister\u2019s doll-house furniture set she had gotten for Christmas. It was for her Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls. It was really quite clever. It was plywood pieces clipped together to make these tables and chairs and they had simple designs on them. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">were the right size for her little Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls and tiny dolls. I [leave] (ph?) the reasoning, looking back on it, because that was the Christmas I wanted to get one of the Star Wars dinosaur robots and was looking forward to shooting everybody and Luke Skywalker is sitting around on one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: The big ones, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. They tie up their legs and fall over, light sabers way up in the air. Be a Jedi and everything. So that\u2019s cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t get it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t. I got slapped when I asked for it. I got slapped to the ground and then immediately ignored. I don\u2019t know why. Of course, I didn\u2019t get it. It was like a $40 item in those days. That\u2019s a big deal and we weren\u2019t rich by any means. My father was mostly on disability or odd jobs he could get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It was your mother that slapped you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Of course. My father . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Your father never did anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: No. (laughs) It seems ludicrous to say it. My father would never hit a child. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t think so, just so you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: When I was very, very young and was clawing at mom like, [\u201cI want this thing. I want this thing to eat.] (ph?) He would just pat my butt with my padded diaper there. I just know that I noticed the contact and he was like, \u201cThat\u2019s called a spanking. That\u2019s what happens if you don\u2019t listen to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">us.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, okay,\u201d like that seemed perfectly rational. So I listened. It wasn\u2019t sort of wham \u2013 this is what happens. It was literally, \u201cThat\u2019s a spanking. That\u2019s what happens.\u201d I was like, \u201cHuh. Okay.\u201d Obviously, I can feel it was done in a disciplinary way and I was like \u201cokay, that makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200552\">sense. There are consequences for actions and they don\u2019t have to be severe if they exist.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563359\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t have to be severe. That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: And the same sort of thing he showed me when I first started walking. We had a wood-burning fire stove and fireplace and we had one of those big old box fans with the holes you could stick your finger through while it was going. Back then they had metal blades. Back then everything was metal. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">I started walking and he took me over to the fireplace and was like, \u201cYou see this? This is fire. This is hot. We don\u2019t want to touch fire.\u201d Then he took a piece of paper. He was like, \u201cYou see this?\u201d He throws it into the fire and it burns up. He was like, \u201cThat could happen to you, so don\u2019t touch <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">this.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d Then he took me to the box fan and was like, \u201cI want to show you this, too.\u201d He takes a pencil and he turns the fan on to high and sticks the pencil in it.  (makes a buzzing noise) \u201cThat could happen to your finger if you put it in there.\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cokay.\u201d That was just the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200593\">way it was. Let me demonstrate these dangers. They could happen to you, so don\u2019t do them. Totally calm. Totally rational the entire time. The only person who made me scream was my mother, and that\u2019s also because she was bi-polar and Tourette\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: She could do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yes. She knows how to push. I probably get a lot of my skill for [splattering] (ph?) points of failure from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about when a child asks their mom \u201cwhere is my toy?\u201d only a mom that\u2019s psychotically angry and upset would do that \u2013 and actually guilty because they don\u2019t want to feel any guilt that they can\u2019t get their son the toy he wants, so I\u2019m going to take it out on them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Bam \u2013 the anger in her eyes when I saw her was amazing; and I went straight down and looked up and she\u2019s back to Akeing Bridget\u2019s diaper, just like nothing happened. I just laid there for a while. Anyway, I didn\u2019t get it. I was hoping Santa would bring it to me because that was something I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">believed in like a fucking idiot. I didn\u2019t get it, but my sister got this dollhouse furniture that she loved and she was so happy about it. So as soon as they went out of the room and were doing something in the kitchen, I just stomped the shit out of it. I stomped it all and it was destroyed. When <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200612\">Bridget came back in she was so devastated. And I didn\u2019t feel responsible. I felt justice, I think.  She was more upset than I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: It must have seemed to a five-year-old boy like the most unfair thing in the world. she got what she wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I got hit for wanting what I wanted. That seemed ridiculous. We talk about it today, my sister and I, and we laugh. It was a total dick move. (laughs) Anyway, I talked to her for a while and I broke the magnet, so I comfort my sister. I\u2019m like, \u201cThanks for listening. I appreciate it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">I love you and I\u2019ll talk to you later. She said, \u201cI love you very much.\u201d I went upstairs and my thoughts continue, so I g-mailed my friend, Darcy, who lives around the corner, who was the maid of honor at her wedding, one of her dearest and closest friends, and is actually her employer right now.  I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">like \u201cAre you there?\u201d \u201cAre you there?\u201d The second time she\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHow\u2019s your day?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cFine.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, what\u2019s up?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not okay. I\u2019m having these sorts of issues.\u201d She\u2019s like \u201cokay\u201d and starts talking me through it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200653\">Darcy is like I am. It\u2019s funny, we\u2019re both Virgos and we attribute it, in some ways, to that Virgo architect, that we both fit [the degree] (ph?), regardless of the validity of astronomy. We both hold pretty close to that particular architect. She does what I do. She\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, you are suffering <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200654\">now and in a calm, rational crisis management level,\u201d completely non-judgmental, which is something both she and I can do. Okay, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening. Whereas Ginny is more awake. Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening and I have to pick out the right thing. Whereas with Darcy and I it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200655\">let\u2019s talk about the right thing. Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening and if there is a right answer, it will be revealed and it\u2019s not on me to find it. It\u2019s going to happen as we\u2019re talking. We\u2019ll find it as we\u2019re talking. It\u2019s not so much we\u2019ll worry about a confidence that there is an answer to these <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200656\">things and it can be arrived at.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563359\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: That must be reassuring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: It is. She\u2019s very stable that way. Even if she totally weren\u2019t and I was like \u201cthese are the issues and I wish you would snap into stable mode,\u201d that\u2019s what I do with Bridget or with the dog. Stop for a second. Let me deal with you and deal with you. Are you both okay? All right. Back to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\"> So I talked to her for a bit and I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d She was like, \u201cYou know, my mom has had a rough time. There are times when she went to a psychiatric ward for a few days. She found it really helpful when this sort of stuff was going on. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d Yeah, I know, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">don\u2019t want that. That seems like one of the worst-case scenarios. So I started texting Hamish (sp?). I think I might have talked to you about him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: I was like I knew that was the only thing that would save me. Like I\u2019m in danger right now. I called you. I called Carla at your urging and she just left a message like \u201cI\u2019m out of office.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I heard that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, I talked to you before. I called again after your urging and I got the number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t know that, either. I called her as well and got that message. Her mailbox was full. Were you able to leave a message?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: You couldn\u2019t leave a message even if you wanted to. You can e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I figured, but I called her back-up eventually, Dr. [Irene Ake,] (ph?) and I left a message like, \u201cHello, this is an urgent matter that would require your immediate attention so I would appreciate a call back at your earliest possible convenience.\u201d I was about to head out the door to go see <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">Hamish \u2013 actually to get a ride from Darcy so it would be easier for me to go see Hamish.  I was like, \u201cIs that something you can even do?\u201d She was like, \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll dig my car out of the driveway.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, God.\u201d She was like, \u201cNo, I need to shovel it. I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m shoveled.\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200792\">was about to head out the door to meet her when she was ready to go, and Irene Ake calls. She was like, \u201cThis is Ake calling for [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:26). Is this he? There is probably something wrong with that. I was tempted to say, \u201cThis is me.\u201d Sometimes that\u2019s me, although that\u2019s incorrect, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200793\">if this is [ ] (inaudible at [0:17:35] She asked what was going on and I said I had some questions about Lithium. I\u2019ve been on it for a couple of months and went up from 300 to 600. During that time I\u2019ve been having these thoughts about killing myself. It seems to be the most logical solution to every <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200794\">problem and it\u2019s been accelerating. I\u2019m worried about it so I stepped down from 600 to 300 and wonder if I can just stop.\u201d  She said that at 300 I could just stop right away. She said especially if it was only for a couple of months there should be no [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:08) whatsoever; my body <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200795\">is fairly acclimated to it. So that was great news. She said that was fine. She asked if I felt like I was in danger and I said no. I know these thoughts are irrational. So she said, \u201cWell, well. You can always give a call back.\u201d I said I was going to go see my psychiatrist tomorrow and I have a support <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200796\">network and have this covered. I hang up and she immediately called back. She said, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re in danger right now?\u201d I said, \u201cNo. I know these things are irrational.\u201d This is what I actually remember from this part of the conversation. \u201cI know these things are irrational, which is why I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200797\">calling people.\u201d  She was like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s good. So what you\u2019re having are intrusive thoughts. You should know there is a psychiatric ward 24\/7. There is a psychiatric ward at Georgetown Hospital in case you ever feel you\u2019re really in danger. I can give you the number right now.\u201d I said, \u201cI can google <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200798\">it; I\u2019m about to head out the door. But thank you. It\u2019s good to know that exists. Thank you for calling back with your concern. I appreciate that, but I\u2019m not in danger right now.\u201d The thing that I liked about her most from the first conversation was that I was like, \u201cI have Lithium and I\u2019m having accelerating <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200799\">things. I know it\u2019s not supposed to do that.\u201d She was like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not supposed to do that; but everyone is different.\u201d Carla is not talking that way. She\u2019s not talking that way. I might very well switch from Carla to Dr. Ake.  I might be like, \u201cYou seem very reasonable. You immediately accepted <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007910\">that what I was feeling was real.\u201d When I talk to Carla and I\u2019m like, \u201cDoes it increase suicidal ideas? She was like, \u201cNo, it does the opposite.\u201d I looked it up online and, again, it does the opposite \u2013 but every now and then there is one comment from someone who took it and it was that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563359\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Did she know that you were experiencing that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: I thought I had made that clear when asking her.

Are you actually in danger?  You\u2019re describing this behavior that\u2019s not very common, but are you actually in danger? That\u2019s good insight to be like holy crap. Maybe he\u2019s worse than he sounds. Let\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">just be sure about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: Good. Yeah. I know her. She\u2019s good. I don\u2019t know her as well as Carla, but I do know her. She seems sharp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: She was sharp. She\u2019s younger, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s younger. She\u2019s a lot younger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: She\u2019s more open to possibility that way, I think. Carla prides herself on how long she\u2019s done this and she falls back on that when we disagree. She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ve done this for a very long time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that kind of defensiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t really give a shit how long you\u2019ve been doing this. I appreciate that you have experience. When I tell you I\u2019m experiencing certain things, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m experiencing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like when you\u2019re talking about maybe we should go to Klonopin and I\u2019m like are you fucking kidding me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">[ ] (crosstalk at 00:22:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Come on. I just liked that very much. I like as well feeling like there is someone who is the key holder to all the medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And she\u2019s not. She\u2019s really not. You can switch. It always is in the context of that relationship, but if you feel like it\u2019s not working, by all means, switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: What if I suddenly have to? What if I\u2019ve waited to the last minute and I\u2019m out of something and I have to get another prescription and I don\u2019t want to go through her for another four months? That wouldn\u2019t even work, would it? I would just be like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Carla anymore. Dear Carla, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">I\u2019m running out of these prescriptions. Can you please write them and send them to the pharmacy?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: If worse came to worse, you could always go to the hospital and they\u2019ll fill them for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I\u2019m out of these things and I can\u2019t reach my psychiatrist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Or you can even tell them that you\u2019re in the middle of transitioning. If you need it they\u2019re going to give it to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a comforting thought. So I went to see Hamish. I said I was really looking for Sativa and he was like, \u201cI just can\u2019t get it this time of year because it needs to be growing outside.\u201d Sativa is what weed is supposed to be to a degree, the best possible version of what it\u2019s supposed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">be when it grows outside in optimal conditions.  He\u2019s like, \u201cBut I can\u2019t because the guy has two grow rooms and he would have to dedicate an entire room to that and he would lose $24,000. People don\u2019t want that anywhere near as much as they want the other stuff.\u201d That makes sense. He\u2019s like, \u201cThese <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A52\">are the lightest I have. These are what I smoke. I\u2019m like you; I like it very light. I like a lot of my mental abilities still about me. Take these but don\u2019t smoke much. I roll a joint and I take two hits; I put it out. That\u2019s how I do it, so try that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563359\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Very titrated amounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s a service industry. He\u2019s a caretaker industry. He\u2019s saving money to open a dispensary because he says he sees the beneficial effects of it. He\u2019s like, \u201cI do this for friends. I do this only for people I really know. I do it because people need it.\u201d  Some people just want <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A91\">it and other people, it\u2019s really good for them. He\u2019s going to be a licensed owner of a dispensary. It will be a great place, too. As I\u2019m leaving he\u2019s like, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d He\u2019s a person like you in that he\u2019s in this because he\u2019s helping people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Did you end up buying the stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: How did it affect you, or did you use it yet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Of course I used it. I immediately went home and smoked it. I rolled an entire joint and smoked half of it. I was like okay, this is too much. Half a joint is too much.  I\u2019m way too high. All right. I had some later out of the vaporizer, a couple of hits, and it was better. I have two brands <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">and switch back and forth. This is better, but not exactly what I\u2019m looking for. I tried the other brand this morning before coming in. This is better. A few hits of this is better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: What do you notice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not as easily distracted. The other is a little more likely to obliterate my focus. I\u2019m trying to play a brand new game, a very complicated brand new game last night \u2013 the one I bought. It\u2019s six different scenarios trying to simulate, trying to survive on a shipwrecked island. There are <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B51\">only a limited amount of control you actually have over the turn of events, so you have to do your best to do so.  If you\u2019re playing by yourself you also get Friday, who is a character who can help you from the book. You also get the dog, who can help you when you\u2019re hunting. He can help you when you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B52\">exploring. But he can\u2019t help you with other things. You can never do everything. You can never do all the things that will protect you from the elements while also trying to build a bonfire that will get you saved at the end of the year. There is not enough time to do everything, so you have to prioritize. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B53\">It\u2019s a great game. It\u2019s incredibly complicated and there are many, many different rules. All these various different decks of cards and tokens interact with each other in different ways. It\u2019s a lovely, lovely sort of experience, but I was having a really hard time focusing all the way through it. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B54\">supposed to be a two-hour game and I was trying to learn it and play it simultaneously. It took me about two-and-a-half hours probably, so that\u2019s not bad.  I got to a point where I was like wait, I cannot possibly win. There is no way I can actually win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the challenge of the game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: I was like, \u201cAh. Three more months and I die. I\u2019m out.\u201d But it\u2019s really great. That was the problem, my focus was \u2013 it\u2019s not something I\u2019d smoke if it was late at night and I was going to play some Mind Graph or something open and sandbox-y for the rest of the night, [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:40), <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">a ridiculous mayhem simulator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s like Grand Theft Auto?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s over the top and ridiculous. Grant Theft Auto is very much fucking great. This latest one is you\u2019re essentially trapped in the matrix, so you have super powers and run and jump through the city.  It\u2019s so great. You can walk around and steal cars and see how fast you can drive, see <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD1\">how many near misses you can accumulate for more points. Every now and then you can mug some people for fun and the aliens come and get you and you shoot a bunch of them. It\u2019s a good time. The point is there are no real restraints, like you have to do these different things. It\u2019s not as if I can play <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD2\">this game where there is so much to keep track of and which phase of the game it\u2019s in is always important. So hopefully I can get to that better focus because I want to play it with Ginny and I\u2019m hoping this is a game she would actually enjoy because I think it\u2019s quite good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563359\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">THERAPIST: How did you end up feeling about the game?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">CLIENT: I liked it quite a bit. It was good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">THERAPIST: The negative connotation you had with it earlier yesterday was different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, the fact that I was sort of feeling like I didn\u2019t deserve it. After you told me it was taking care of myself and not mania, I was like oh, okay. Well that\u2019s life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: What I\u2019m thinking about, too, and something important about all this is that it seemed there was so much, as you\u2019re saying this, that went on to get you to that point where you\u2019re staring at the screwdriver. There was a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s been accelerating over the course of months. I blame Lithium to some degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the significant changee in my life. I had all those stressors and that just going to accelerate it more, I suppose.  You would talk about and I thought it would seem unfair that I would be exhausted after a three-and-a-half hour interview and not sleeping well on the way up to the interview <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">or sleeping well after that interview and constantly thinking about it for days and days. I guess it makes sense that I would be exhausted. It was a lot of energy expended on one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. There is something, too, about it that reminded me about the story of the Christmas memory; like in some way you\u2019re hoping for something good to happen, you\u2019re buying the gift for yourself, and then you get really pissed at yourself about buying it. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: Weakness. When I do things that are unwise, like I\u2019m just doing this so that I\u2019ll feel better. It makes me feel better for a little bit, but there is then the weed.  I did the one thing I knew would save me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">THERAPIST: There is something important here, too, about you hoping for the job and almost getting your hopes up and rewarding yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">CLIENT: Sure, but now I\u2019m also worried. Now I have weed, right? I don\u2019t know if I can do both as effectively or if I\u2019ll be effective at my job as I would be otherwise and how I\u2019m going to be able to best control that and what it\u2019s going to be like. The good news is that I won\u2019t be smoking weed all day. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D51\">It will probably be a couple of times at night. That\u2019s that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">THERAPIST: How much were you smoking when you were working at Harmonics?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: Every night. For years. For years.

I think you know the other thing; here is where the trade-off is \u2013 something like math, you learning math. You\u2019re in a much better place. Even though you were sharp and you might have had an increased acuity of your mind back then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201071\">you\u2019re in a much different place to learn it because of your psychological wisdom and knowing and being able to know how to learn. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.

You take it and you just stop wanting to smoke. They don\u2019t advertise for it anymore. It works well. They say it goes into your brain and it cleans out the receptors that want nicotine, so you eventually just stop wanting to smoke. I was taking it and I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201211\">\u201cThis is cool. I\u2019m smoking less and less. I don\u2019t really find the desire for it. Sometimes I still want a cigarette, but not often.\u201d  I was having these crazy dreams. There were these acorn-shaped pustules coming off my head ripping away my flesh. What the fuck are these? Crazy, vivid bullshit. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201212\">is a possible side effect. I wound up sitting on my couch and was like, \u201cI should just kill myself.\u201d Then I was like, \u201cWait a minute \u2013 what?\u201d So I went online and looked up Chantix and possible side effects and found it might increase suicidal thoughts. This guy wrote an article and was like, \u201cYeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201213\">I was taking Chantix and suddenly I wanted to kill myself and I had no idea why. I kept wanting to kill myself. It didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d So I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, great. I\u2019m done.\u201d I stopped taking Chantix instead of smoking.

If I knew the doctor would listen to me, I\u2019d go to the doctor and say, \u201cListen, the best time I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201251\">had, the most success I\u2019ve had was with Lamictal, Klonopin, and a strong Sativa blend, like mostly Sativa. That is what I need. Let\u2019s try that and I bet I\u2019m going to be at the best I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d  And if the doctor listened to me they would say, \u201cHere is your prescription. Here is a dispensary where <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201252\">you can go and be like \u2018this is what I need.\u2019\u201d But that won\u2019t be for a while. Dispensaries are going to open, they\u2019re just trying to get past the blockade where the state is like, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t stop a dispensary from being in your town. If they want to build one, they\u2019re building one, just like any <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201253\">other business.\u201d If you don\u2019t want it there, I\u2019m sorry. This is the thing that we have to have now because we\u2019ve decriminalized this and we have medical marijuana. Therefore, there are going to be places.

Weed is horrible for bi-polar.\u201d [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201291\">at 00:43:41) way down in the back of a few paragraphs. [ ] says this is much better.

You can get medicated for that, but we don\u2019t think you should smoke weed. We can\u2019t recommend it as a treatment. Okay, but you do recommend Lithium. You\u2019re very big on Lithium and that almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D1\">killed me. That almost killed me. Suicide isn\u2019t something you do; it\u2019s something that happens to you.

You\u2019re literally reduced to the basest, basest pain; and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201391\">is all that exists.

Are we almost done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, until 40.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20161\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m going to fire Carla and pick up Irene Ake. Out of respect and not wanting to cause emotional harm, I won\u2019t tell her I\u2019m firing her unless she\u2019s a bitch about it. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20163\">THERAPIST: She won\u2019t. Maybe she will. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20165\">CLIENT: Unless you get pumped and you\u2019re defensive about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20167\">THERAPIST: My guess is it isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been fired. She\u2019s been around for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20166-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20166-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563359\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re right.

If you\u2019re not a fit for me then I\u2019m not going to see you. I\u2019m a customer. Ta-da. I am a customer here and not a charity case. It makes me feel better. We can talk about anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016F\">THERAPIST: All right. Monday then. The 17th at 10:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20171\">CLIENT: That would be good. I think we can help her feel better about this. I told her that last night. I said, \u201cI want you to know I did all these things. I did them all by myself.\u201d  It\u2019s important for you to realize that I can do these things by myself, that you do not have to worry, specifically <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201711\">that this relationship is too often about me when I think you need to realize that it\u2019s about us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yeah, to have that kind of Darcy quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah, to feel like I have the support network. It is large and it involves many more people than you. If it\u2019s going to be a stress on you in any way I have other opportunities, so you need not worry that it all falls to you, which is Ginny\u2019s thing. How many swords can I fall on today? See you Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20177\">THERAPIST: See you Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20179\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
