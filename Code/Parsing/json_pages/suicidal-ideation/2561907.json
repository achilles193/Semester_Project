But my grandma ended up asking about this three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">times, and then also like my mom was all like \u201cOh, well, you should be temping.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: To you, or him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: To me.

Like there\u2019s not like the same sort of selection that there is here with like lots of skilled people. And like, you know, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">have no friends there and I\u2019m just going to go back and be miserable anyways. And I really felt the logical solution to all this, you know, of costing all this money, was for me to kill myself, like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: What stopped you from doing it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

Like you can\u2019t deal with me being suicidal, like. I can\u2019t just stop feeling like this,\u201d but like he didn\u2019t want to leave. But he wanted me to stop being suicidal, and (inaudible at 00:04:28) and like clearly the solution would have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">been for him to leave if he couldn\u2019t deal with me being like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: How would you feel how do you feel when the roles are reversed? Does he report feeling suicidal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: No. He hasn\u2019t wanted to hurt himself in like at least months, if not like a year or so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Like his depression is more to\u2026 Well, I guess sometimes he\u2019s all like \u201cOh, well, I wish I would have died,\u201d but it like is maybe for like, you know, 30 seconds or something, and I\u2019m like \u201cNo, you don\u2019t deserve to die\u201d and like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Ah.

And it\u2019s like enough to last a whole year, plus all his other money, so that\u2019s how he can support himself, so therefore he doesn\u2019t deserve to die <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">because (inaudible at 00:05:35) solution he\u2019ll get over his depression before he runs out of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s not really about deserving to die, but it\u2019s about or is not being able to support yourself means you should be dead?
