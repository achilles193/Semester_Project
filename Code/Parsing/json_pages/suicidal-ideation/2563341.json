I want to [inaudible at 00:00:35] There we go. I had my bag one day [ph] going to the work center. To work, to work it up!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">RESPONDENT: So, man \u2013 so you want messages today, I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">INTERVIEWER: I did, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">RESPONDENT: So I immediately cut back my lithium to 300 a day. I\u2019m not taking two pills a day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">I went back to \u2013 I looked at my mood chart\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">RESPONDENT: I studied the past couple of months of it, and \u2013 Darcy was over last night. I was like, \u201cAh, I\u2019m having all these side effects, like my hands are trembling and I\u2019m feeling nauseous, and my kidneys hurt.\u201d And I know what it is like when your kidneys hurt. I just took a shot to the kidneys <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">in college, and they were bleeding for a little while, so I\u2019m familiar with kidney pain and how that works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">RESPONDENT: I had my blood drawn on Tuesday, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">INTERVIEWER: You just had it done Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">RESPONDENT: Yep, so I await the results in a few days. But the fax is to Carla, and I won\u2019t be surprised if my blood toxicity is above the 1.0 level. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">INTERVIEWER: Mm. What were you on \u2013 what are you\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">RESPONDENT: Six hundred. I was on 600, twice a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">INTERVIEWER: And when did you go up to six?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">RESPONDENT: What is that? About a month, total \u2013 a month, total.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">INTERVIEWER: Oh, OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">RESPONDENT: And so, looking at the mood chart \u2013 and Darcy was even over. She was like, \u201cYeah, but it seems like there was a good period where you were doing really well.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I was on 300 milligrams of lithium, and I was 400 of Lamictal, and I was taking one to 1.5 Klonopin a day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">RESPONDENT: I was like. \u201cYeah, that was a really good spot. I was really pleased with that.\u201d And then I went up to the 600, and it was like an increasing \u2013 an increasingly disturbing amount of my decision-making, running into, \u201cWell, I should just kill myself\u201d for the slightest of things, the slightest <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">of anticipations and so forth. \u201cMan, money is going to be getting tight. Well, I should probably just kill myself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">RESPONDENT: But not like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sad. I should kill myself,\u201d but just sitting there, going, \u201cThe logical thing would be just to kill myself.\u201d And when all my thought processes were ending with, \u201cI should probably just kill myself,\u201d I was like, \u201cSomething is clearly wrong.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">And this past week, especially just \u2013 I know I drank a lot on Sunday, but even through Tuesday, I was feeling awful and, on Wednesday, I was feeling a little bit better; that was yesterday. And today, I\u2019m feeling fine, like I don\u2019t feel my hand trembling as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">RESPONDENT: And the thing is \u2013 here is what is pissing me off, Carl. Right? Psychiatrists are fucking idiots, just like doctors. They\u2019ve got all these fucking books in front of them and all these stats and whatever, and [pauses] \u2013 and the other [ph] is learned. You go and do your own research, and you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">like, \u201cOh, here is what my fucking doctor forgot to tell me.\u201d For instance, Carla never mentioned, if you\u2019re on lithium, do not drink alcohol; don\u2019t do it. It is \u2013 because it can mask your body\u2019s ability to recognize that it has been poisoned.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563341\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">INTERVIEWER: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">RESPONDENT: She never mentioned that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">INTERVIEWER: And she never\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">RESPONDENT: No, that never came up, because it has probably never come up in her practice. [Pauses] As well as other things \u2013 yeah, other signs of toxicity are hand tremor and drowsiness, and \u2013 I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, these are all signs of toxicity that I own, that I\u2019m researching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">RESPONDENT: And Carla, of course, would be like, \u201cOh, your research on the Web and you see things that scare you.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, no, I see things that are happening.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">RESPONDENT: And I\u2019m just like, \u201cThis is a pain in the ass. I don\u2019t want to keep switching psychiatrists until I find one who is going to prescribe me things that work.\u201d Right? So I meet with her a week from Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">RESPONDENT: I\u2019m just going to be like, \u201cWell, I dropped down to 300, and that seemed to be working fine.\u201d And if that is just placebo then fine. I\u2019ll ditch it and I know that I\u2019m fine with Klonopin and Lamictal. So\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, but there is kind of a sense that she is not going to really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">RESPONDENT: Well, it is the same thing like Darcy and I were talking about, where she had Dr. Vaughn back when I did, and she switched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">INTERVIEWER: She did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">RESPONDENT: Yep, and then she switched again. And it is the same thing my sister runs into, as well. It is like psychiatrists want to fiddle with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">RESPONDENT: They\u2019re like, there is this perfect state they can get you to, and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t, because bullshit.\u201d It is like maybe you, with your normal brain chemistry, think that you can fix everybody else, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">INTERVIEWER: Well, I think you\u2019re also right to be observant of what \u2013 especially at this period, when you\u2019re changing things up very \u2013 very\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">RESPONDENT: Pretty rapidly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">INTERVIEWER: Very rapidly and very, very importantly. These are hard \u2013 these are major medications. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">INTERVIEWER: And you\u2019ve got to be really observant about what is going on with you. And I think you should definitely be \u2013 and I\u2019ll certainly reiterate to her \u2013 I\u2019ll probably send her an e-mail, telling her what you\u2019ve been telling me, and noting that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">RESPONDENT: Sure, go ahead. That it is not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">INTERVIEWER: \u2026That there has been an increase in how\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">RESPONDENT: \u2026In suicidal ideation, which, of course, \u201cDid you [ph]?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, that is impossible. Lithium\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">INTERVIEWER: Well, lithium doesn\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">RESPONDENT: What the \u2013 yeah, they don\u2019t have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">INTERVIEWER: Everybody is different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">RESPONDENT: Exactly! Everybody is different. Brains are \u2013 it is an incredibly complex machine. Neuroscientists are still trying to figure out how it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">INTERVIEWER: And they do have to adjust and be sensitive to what is going on with the individual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">RESPONDENT: Right. And it gets to the point where, \u201cListen, writing me these prescriptions, can you do that? If not, can you recommend a better psychiatrist, one that will listen to what I am saying?\u201d Because it is absolutely ridiculous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">I mean, it is like, \u201cYou\u2019re a patient.\u201d No, no, no, you work for me, Carla. You work for me. And I will fire you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Well, and I\u2019ll say the other thing \u2013 it is not uncommon for this stuff to go \u2013 to \u2013 in fact, most people I\u2019ve run into, that are trying to change medications and adding new things, it never is the first go; it just never is. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563341\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">INTERVIEWER: It is never \u2013 usually not even the second go in terms of what is the right dosage. It really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">RESPONDENT: Well, and then, she is like, \u201cWell, 300 milligrams shouldn\u2019t actually have any effect, like shouldn\u2019t get you into the clinical \u2013 we call it clinical efficacy in terms of blood toxicity.\u201d Something between 0.6 and 1.0 is where you want to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">INTERVIEWER: Did you already do a blood test?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">RESPONDENT: I just \u2013 that is what I\u2019ve been doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">INTERVIEWER: That was just the one test for\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. And it is one of the messiest-looking blood test results, in terms of on my arm. She was new, and she was so sweet, though, because she was really worried about hurting me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">And I\u2019m meditative through the process. That made it a little easier. But there was a three or four year-old in the other room, who was having his blood taken for the first time, and he was screaming and crying because there is traumatic effect. Someone is sticking a needle in you, and that hurts real <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">bad if you\u2019re a little kid, as you have no context of pain of that kind. And that was the day when my Spanish came in really useful. It was when we were actually in the blood lab, with the nurses asking him what to do. She is speaking Spanish to the blood lab technician, the one who runs it. And she <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F2\">is like, \u201cOh, yeah, just go and take him over there, sit him down, get him ready,\u201d but she said it in Spanish, so I was able to start moving. I was like, \u201cOK, I know where I\u2019m supposed to go.\u201d Not that I could have said that in Spanish \u2013 I spent long enough to hear \u2013 I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, yeah, she wants me <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F3\">to \u2013\u201d she instructed her to go and sit me down somewhere else, so I\u2019ll go and do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">And she is a very sweet woman. She\u2019s taking my blood, and I heard that kid cry, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, poor little kid.\u201d She is like, \u201cYou feel them?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI do.\u201d Which is the English version of, \u201cLo siento,\u201d which is like, \u201cYou experience this pain?\u201d Like, \u201cYou feel as if you were him?\u201d It is such <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">a better way to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d There are two in Spanish \u2013 \u201cDisculpeme\/Perdoneme,\u201d which is just like, \u201cOh, my bad. Sorry\u201d versus \u201cLo siento,\u201d which is, \u201cI feel what you are feeling.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm, hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">INTERVIEWER: Very different, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, but she said it in English. This is one of those benefits [ph] of taking other languages \u2013 when someone is speaking English, no their first language, and they are speaking it strangely, I\u2019m like, \u201cAh, I know why you\u2019re saying what you\u2019re saying. What you would say in Spanish is this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">and so that is what you\u2019re trying to convey.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">So it makes it easier to communicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">INTERVIEWER: Well, yeah. What is important in all of this seems to be the idea of somebody understand \u2013 of saying, \u201cI feel what you\u2019re feeling\u201d as opposed to something different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.

And this \u2013 it probably is also linked to the fact that I spent most of my childhood in a mall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2020B\">INTERVIEWER: [Whispers] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2020D\">RESPONDENT: Like, this was every day. Every day, we would go on errands, which is where she would take us to the mall and she would buy things she didn\u2019t need. And we would also get things we didn\u2019t even need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2020F\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20211\">RESPONDENT: You know? Unless there wasn\u2019t enough money for her to buy stuff she wanted, in which case she would buy what she wanted regardless of what we needed. The fucking juice extractor versus pants for me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20213\">INTERVIEWER: She\u2019d go with the\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20215\">RESPONDENT: \u2026Juice extractor, because God told her to get the juice extractor. And she would just laugh at me, how angry I was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20217\">INTERVIEWER: Oh, boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20219\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. So \u2013 but crazy bitch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021B\">\u201cCrazy, fucking cunt,\u201d as my father would call her. You know? Completely dehumanizing language to what he would use normally. But, yeah\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021D\">INTERVIEWER: Well, it is hard to see the humanity in somebody buying a juice extractor\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021F\">RESPONDENT: \u2026Over pants that I\u2019d need. Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20221\">INTERVIEWER: \u2026Needs for her son.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20223\">RESPONDENT: I had two pairs of pants; they were the same pair in different colors. And I was outgrowing them, and people at school had noticed how I had only two pants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20225\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20227\">RESPONDENT: And they\u2019d mock me for it. Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20229\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022B\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">INTERVIEWER: Well, she wasn\u2019t a mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">RESPONDENT: No, she wasn\u2019t! She wasn\u2019t and she never will be. Never will be no matter how much she begs. But [pauses] \u2013 but I am hopeful for this job. If I don\u2019t get this job, it is the coffee shop. And it is like, \u201cGo get a job at a coffee shop.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">INTERVIEWER: But what about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">RESPONDENT: Well, that\u2019d be a little depressing, wouldn\u2019t it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">RESPONDENT: Would I be managing that coffee shop within a few months? Absolutely. But, like, still [pauses] \u2013 or some other coffee shop. [Pauses for ten seconds] Yeah. So, [pauses] again, I just don\u2019t want to be fiddled with. It is like, when I feel that I\u2019m OK, that is when you stop prescribing me <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202371\">anything else. It is simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">RESPONDENT: I may be prescribing 400 milligrams of Lamictal, and you give me 1.5 milligrams of Klonopin, and maybe 300 milligrams of lithium. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">Unless it is just placebo, in which case fuck it. Who needs this kind of metric [ph] $1.05 at the pharmacy? At least not a prescription. Kilo Ks [ph] are really small, so [pauses] yeah \u2013 it is amazing how bad her healthcare was when she worked at a hospice agency. You know? Like [pauses]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">INTERVIEWER: [inaudible at 00:36:31] Yeah. It looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">RESPONDENT: It is ridiculous. Like you said \u2013 \u201cshady.\u201d And it was shady.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, [inaudible at 00:36:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, but [exhales] yeah. But this job interview on Tuesday \u2013 because, yesterday, I reached out to Viggo, and I was like, \u201cHey, man, I just wondered if there had been any progress on your end.\u201d He was like, \u201cOh, yeah, could you come in for a couple of hours?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d And I\u2019ve been <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202451\">rehearsing this interview for over a month now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20244-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20244-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563341\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20247\">So I\u2019m feeling pretty good about it. And I\u2019ll continue to rehearse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20249\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024B\">RESPONDENT: And [pauses] eventually I\u2019ll learn. [Sighs] Really, the only problem is \u2013 there are two potential problems, the second of which is unlikely to be the problems that they\u2019re having me coming in. That problem would be, \u201cOh, we\u2019re not really ready to \u2013 we\u2019re not really sure. We\u2019re not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2024B1\">comfortable with the idea the QA plan leaves no need for [ph] one,\u201d which would be a stupid thing for them to turn me down for. [Pauses] The other possibility is like, \u201cOh, am I the oldest guy in the company? Is that a problem for you?\u201d It is like, \u201cHello, Mr. CEO. I\u2019m a good seven years older than <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2024B2\">you are.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024D\">But I think that is the thing to that I try to put forward, is like, \u201cI\u2019m not looking to run a company. I\u2019ve no desire to run a company.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI want to build stuff. I want to help you make your shit better.

It is like, \u201cI\u2019m here to help you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">RESPONDENT: And there is really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">INTERVIEWER: Did you see this real often [ph]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, exactly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got more experience than you guys, in the industry,\u201d so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">INTERVIEWER: That was like \u2013 what? back in the \u201880s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, yeah. Like, \u201cKill troll with ax.\u201d [Chuckles] \u201cKill troll.\u201d \u201cKill troll with what?\u201d \u201cKill troll with ax.\u201d Oh, OK. You kill the troll with the ax. [Pauses] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">So it is very dark. You\u2019re likely to be eaten by a grue. So [pauses]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">INTERVIEWER: But he had been there \u2013 yeah, I remember you talking about him. He had been there for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">RESPONDENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah, for a long time. Yeah, he was at Melody, and he had lots of great sage advice, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">INTERVIEWER: He\u2019d been around for years, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">RESPONDENT: \u2026After a while, they started telling him to shut the fuck up every time he was like, \u201cWe\u2019re hemorrhaging millions of dollars a years, and here are some ways to stop hemorrhaging millions of dollars a year.\u201d They\u2019d just shut him down. So he actually left the company on the same day that I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">INTERVIEWER: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">RESPONDENT: We both were like, \u201cLay us off, because we\u2019re out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">INTERVIEWER: Hmph.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">RESPONDENT: All the people in finance, all the people who are like, \u201cYou\u2019re hemorrhaging millions of dollars a year \u2013 tens of millions of dollars a year. Here are our suggestions for how we could slow that lead.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">But they just didn\u2019t want to hear it. They wanted to believe their own fairytale. \u201cNo, no, no, we\u2019re rock stars. We\u2019re just going to keep doing what we\u2019re doing until it works again.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20279\">RESPONDENT: I have to explain, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work the first time. You got bought, and they gave you an unlimited budget for two years.\u201d So that was amazing, and once it became an actual budget, they started hemorrhaging millions of dollars a year. [Pauses] They called me to task for having a $6-million <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202791\">budget. I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, fine. I never had a budget. This was never brought to my attention that I actually had any money to spend. And now you\u2019ve actually made us responsible for budgets, and you\u2019re surprised that you\u2019ve been spending $6 million a year. And you\u2019ve been paying that money TBA [ph] without <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202792\">my knowledge or input.\u201d So whatever.

How do you like that? I cut $5 million out of the budget right there.\u201d Just as efficient, just as <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D1\">good.

No, I \u2013 as you would think about doing another \u2013 working with a new company, you know that there are all these kind of maneuvers that people do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20281\">RESPONDENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20283\">INTERVIEWER: And things that put people \u2013 and it is psychologically [chuckles] demanding to figure out how you negotiate all that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20285\">RESPONDENT: Well, you know what my job is, ultimately?

And \u2013 to make them feel safe. And they\u2019ve got one guy right now, I think, I\u2019ve worked with before.

And I\u2019m like, \u201cHe can difficult to work with. He works incredibly hard,\u201d blah-blah-blah. And an artist, goes up there and is like \u2013 he has written a poem. [Chuckles] <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202C31\">[Pauses] He opens it up and unfolds it, and cruises through it in front of the whole company, and he is like, \u201cRoses are red. Violets are blue.

I was like, \u201cListen, I tell my testers who are afraid of you \u2013 I tell them, \u2018You don\u2019t need to be afraid of him. He\u2019s is a teddy bear.
