OK, planning on for Wednesday at 10:00; Thursday, 5:15; Friday, 10:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yea? OK. All right. [0:02:59] And let's see Skype?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yea. My I.D. is [inaudible](ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:03:10) is my e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: OK, all right. OK. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yea. I'm nervous about this. So I met with Dr. Vaughn (ph) yesterday. And she suggested to me I think what she talked with you about that DBT might be a good thing which has more weight coming from her than from somebody else. [0:04:03] I don't know how to talk to you about it because then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">I feel like I'm trying to like mediate between you two somehow. (chuckling) I wonder where that comes from. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Does that mean you think I think it's a bad idea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Sort of, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Oh, I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: I mean, there's a level at which your fantasy and well, it's important but maybe...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: (chuckling) But the actual reality in this situation is also important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: I think so in this case, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: OK, yea. She said that she thought it would be a good idea if it was not going to get in the way of what we do here. And I don't know whether it would or not. [0:05:00] Part of me wonders it seems like a lot of the DBT skills are basically it's ways to avoid dealing with... ways to avoid <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200571\">having to tackle your emotions head on when they're too big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">And so I don't know... so I guess my question is, I feel like a lot of what we've been doing is I'm very good at avoiding tackling my emotions. And I feel like a lot of what we've done is to sort of I don't know take away my excuses for doing so. [0:06:00] So I don't know whether there's a way to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200591\">kind of put emotions aside that does not make them... doesn't magnify them. And I sort of worry that the more I put them aside, the more I am just a coward. I don't want to deal with it at all. And I don't want to. (crying) And I don't know how to handle this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098826\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Well, I don't think the problem is you being able to put aside or have ways of kind of coping with rather than, let's say, confronting your emotions. [0:07:01] I think one problem is when you do that without realizing that you're doing that. And when there's no good time to deal with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">But I suspect that doing some DBT... I mean, I have a few thoughts about this sort of the context for it. But I don't think it would necessarily get in the way of what we're doing here. In fact, it's possible it could be helpful in that if you feel more confident about being able to sort of cope more, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">let's say, rather than facing more. [0:08:11] Cope more with rather than facing more what you're feeling when that seems like the more appropriate thing to do. If that helps you be less scared of the intensity of what you're feeling and how it could affect you, it makes this easier. I mean, not a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Well thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: I mean I wish it would but... sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: (chuckling) No, it's OK. I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: (chuckling) But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I wouldn't believe you if you said it would it make it a lot easier. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: (chuckling) Oh, you wouldn't. [0:09:00] It could take some of the edge off. I mean, I know a lot of what you worry about is what gets stripped away here or what we look underneath. And having to go home and live through the next day or night or whatever. And I'm sure that is part of what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">makes it hard to get into something when you're here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Probably somewhat consciously and somewhat not. And I would imagine if you felt a little more confident about being able to manage that stuff while you're at home or wherever, you might be less scared here. [0:10:04] I mean, plus it's obviously in extent to what you're really not scared <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">of is a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: OK. Thanks. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: One thing, I think, probably is important and I'm sure you that you felt this as well is totally that you work with someone individually on the DBT stuff as opposed to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: A group thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: ...a group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Like someone...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Based on my experiences with groups, I think that's probably true. (chuckling) That I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yea, I think for the person to like get to know you. And there are people who do that kind of work. [0:11:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yea, I know. Part of the thing that it's I just don't want to work with anybody else. It just sounds really hard. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yea. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: So I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: If I had to guess, I would say it would probably not be nearly hard as this. That's probably... there are probably people for whom that's less true. But I think for you, I think that kind of work...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: It comes pretty naturally in some ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yea. I think the hard part would to be having to be quite explicit about the person you were working with about how you've been doing and what has been going on. And how well the coping strategies work or didn't work. [0:12:02] But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yea, I don't think of myself as somebody who finds it difficult to be explicit about that. But I guess I really do. (chuckling) I'm pretty terrible about it, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I don't think that you're terrible at it. It's just it's hard for you to say you've been feeling really suicidal. It's hard to say you really don't have a lot of hope for anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098826\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yea, it gets easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yea. Well, that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Well, sort of good.

I guess I'm curious as to your mental thoughts of those parts. It's not something you talk much about. I'm just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's one of those things that everybody seems to think would work really well for me.

[0:14:03] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: In you're already working so incredibly hard sort of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: And honestly, I do find it very stressful to navigate you talking to Dr. Vaughn (ph) and Dr. Smith (ph) and talking to you about that. I get really anxious about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: And I'm like I don't want to have to introduce somebody else to you. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Right. (pause) I know you just said you felt really anxious. I had imagined that would partly to do with thinking Dr. Vaughn (ph) and I were sort of on opposite sides of this one. [0:15:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yea, I worry that people will disagree and then I'll have to choose or something. And yea, I just find it hard to handle. (pause) I guess there's not really that much space in mind the idea of you talking with somebody with another person and not disagreeing. Conflict seems to be the norm. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">(chuckling) (pause) (crying) [0:16:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I mean, I don't know.

(chuckling) I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">THERAPIST: We all see the same person. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">CLIENT: See, you say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">CLIENT: But like I'm not always... I mean, not so much with like you and Dr. Vaughn (ph) but I'm not always sure that that's true of people in the hospital. I mean, Dr. Smith (ph), I don't really have a good gauge for her yet. [0:18:05] I don't know. I guess... yea, I guess I worry that I don't show <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB1\">up as the same person.

(chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Right. Well, and sometimes you do have a long history of that. Not like for any malintent (sic) or anything but in a way. But I guess empirically that hasn't been the case with (inaudible at 0:19:02) and I. And I think there are ways in which I've seen different sides of you like you talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED1\">a lot more often, blah, blah, blah.

[0:20:02] And was angry and uncooperative basically. It's how I feel like I came <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF1\">off based on how they treated me. I don't know.

I go to bed really early and just toss and turn. I would kind of drift in and out of sleep. So I don't know. Anywhere from like four to six hours. I'm opening tomorrow and the next day also. So I got up at 3:30 this morning. It's pretty hilarious to get up at 3:30. Let me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B1\">tell you. [0:24:00] (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">THERAPIST: And you just couldn't stay asleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">CLIENT: No. I had to go to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">THERAPIST: How early do you open?

(pause) [0:25:00] I sort of don't want to go home. It's just that I don't know how to talk to anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">THERAPIST: I think you're also completely terrified that we won't be meeting.

But that's a lot less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">THERAPIST: And in a different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">CLIENT: Yea. And there is never any privacy at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">THERAPIST: And if you need to go to the hospital, it'll be harder for me to like... I mean, I'll help any way I can, of course. [0:26:02] But I think my point is that like I imagine there's a little reassurance in being here and like the way things went when you went to the hospital before where like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201291\">(inaudible at 0:26:14) that you called. We met.

(pause) I've been very determinedly not thinking about next week. (chuckling) Really the thought that I might go to the hospital next week had not crossed my mind at all even though all the pieces were there. I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Didn't want to think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: I'm very good at not thinking about things.

What I'm thinking is your family would see it right in front of their face which I know in a way would be the last thing you would want. [0:28:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: But another way I could imagine it might be something you'd want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I'm not sure if any way I prefer (ph). (pause) I will feel like most of my family both really gets it and really doesn't get it at the same time. And I'm not sure that being closer to it would make them get it anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">THERAPIST: I see. [0:29:03] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">CLIENT: I mean, they that I think about that it's reassuring. That that would be reassuring would be just not being my own responsibility for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">CLIENT: I don't know. I guess also I so strongly don't want to burden my family with something like this. That it's hard for me to tell whether it would also be gratifying, if that makes sense. [0:30:02] They've been through it all along before, in a sense. (pause) They know the drill. (pause) [0:31:00] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201431\">Yea. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">Even when I was in the hospital, papa came to visit me. I pretty much had it together when he was there. But they see me when it gets really bad. [0:32:00] (pause) And I also just feel like I have to tough the next week out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">THERAPIST: It's a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">CLIENT: Yea, yea it is. But it's not actually any different from what I've been doing. [0:33:00] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">THERAPIST: I guess not although I wonder if you'll have less space and more pressure to be together. And there can be some of that or even a fair amount of it with James around in a small apartment. Yea, but James has got nothing on our relatives for filling up a room. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">CLIENT: In the past years, I have gotten good at asking for space. And so they've gotten good at sort of giving into me so that's good. I think we're going to have own back room which is nice. [0:34:01] And people are usually OK if I kind of retreat up there. But I can't really spend the whole trip <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201511\">in the bedroom. (chuckling) So does that make senses? Yes. (pause) Which is... I mean, I think the thing I should be worried about is being left alone for extended periods of time. So I don't have to worry too much about that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">THERAPIST: Do you have a bad feeling about the trip?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">CLIENT: I don't know. [0:35:01] I have bad feelings. (chuckling) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yea, maybe I'm focusing too much on the change in the trip and not enough on the fact of the ongoing awfulness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) So one thing that is scary that I find in my kind of constant mental calculations is sort of almost on I can't do this to James to. [0:36:04] Well, is there any way that it would be so horrible to find me?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20158-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20158-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098826\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: What have you thought of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">CLIENT: Pills which are very ineffective as far as I can tell. But it seems like the least horrible thing or just going somewhere else. (pause) [0:37:01] (crying) It's very strange that this is my life.

Well, not all the time but most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">THERAPIST: And that it sounds like it's a real fight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">CLIENT: Yea. I don't know how much farther there is like how much more ground that I could lose because I haven't lost it yet. Does that make sense? Like I don't know how much worse it could get?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">THERAPIST: Yep. That's how farther down there is to go in a way? [0:39:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">CLIENT: Yea. So that's where I am. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">THERAPIST: So it's getting worse.

Again, thought about the fact that like the terms of the bargaining that's going on in my head are changing but they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">THERAPIST: And as far as that you can't do this to James too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: Too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: Maybe there's a way you can do this so that it won't be too horrible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">THERAPIST: The way he finds you or somebody finds you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yea. [0:40:03] (pause) Even though I kind of snap back into something more like sense. That's hard. I think that is the hardest. I just feel like there's no way out of this. (pause) (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017F\">THERAPIST: So it's kind of like a rationalizing to yourself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: ...that you're doing like as though it wouldn't be so bad to him if it wasn't so bad of how you were found which allows you to sort of consider it more seriously.
