(pause) So, I went to bed by like 9:30 last night. James went to bed at like 2 or 3, which is not unusual for him, but I usually like to roll over and go back to sleep.

(pause) I\u2019m not sure what either. You know in part, saying that like, \u201cOkay, well I\u2019ll talk to Chad tonight,\u201d was sort of like a commitment that I had made. It\u2019s like, okay, well I don\u2019t \u2013 all of this off the table until at least that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So I could sort of take a break from it.

[0:03:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I mean like I stayed in bed, and sort of like you\u2019re awake and thinking, but you\u2019re not really awake enough to actually want to get up. (pause) I \u2013 (pause) It was strange, because like I was pretty calm, and pretty comfortable, and like not unhappy in that moment. [0:04:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">But I was like nope, I still want to die. (pause) Yeah. (pause) [0:05:27] (pause) See I\u2019m typically, I want it to be \u2013 (sigh) typically, I wanted everything set \u2013 I say no, I can\u2019t do that. Just because I sort of imagine how that would play out in my head, and, you know, I had imagined peoples\u2019 reactions, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">and I imagined what it would do to them, and (pause) I never know, like that makes me sad; like I feel sorry, but I also feel like I can actually control other peoples\u2019 happiness. [0:06:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Which I feel like is probably a good life lesson in the long run, but maybe not that convenient for right now. (laughter) But there it is. (pause) [0:07:58]-[0:08:58] (pause) Yeah, I feel like I spend so much time trying to (pause) trying to derail my intuitive responses to things, because I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">like, you know, I come to think that my intuitive responses are not actually that good for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">But, like I don\u2019t know what self-preservation looks like right now.

[overlapping conversation at 0:11:15]. That\u2019d be okay. Well, (sigh) I guess I\u2019m thinking of yesterday when you were here, and it was becoming my decision about whether you went to the hospital or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And then, like I made the call for \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That decision may be too much for you right now. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know, in some ways I find that immature. [But it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know how much I trust you.] (ph) (crying) (pause) [0:12:15] (pause) You doing okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I have an itch on my back. (pause) [0:13:15] Thanks.

(pause) (inaudible at 0:13:41) right now. (pause) (sigh) (crying) [0:14:41] (pause) (crying) I\u2019m mean and awful. (crying) (pause) [0:15:41] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">Okay, here\u2019s what I mean. So yesterday, you said that, you know, you couldn\u2019t fix this. But given time you could help, you thought, but you couldn\u2019t fix this. And so I can see \u2013 I can see how this is going to go away this time; I can see how I\u2019m going to feel better, eventually. I don\u2019t know exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">how, it just \u2013 it happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562260\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I don\u2019t see (pause) (crying) I don\u2019t see a point at which I just stop being destroyed by this, and I don\u2019t \u2013 (crying) I don\u2019t know. (pause) [0:16:54] (pause) (sigh) You know, and I can sort of say \u2013 say like at eight-hour period, or two days, or two weeks, or you know, often just eight hours \u2013 but like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I don\u2019t (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well what\u2019s the point if it\u2019s just going to keep coming back all the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I mean putting aside the question (pause) how you \u2013 of your view of that at other times when you\u2019re not feeling that? It\u2019s very clear that when you are feeling this bad, you\u2019re quite sure. This is never really going to be any different. [0:18:00] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">Like this is a conviction that you have at these times. (pause) I guess what you\u2019re really focused on at the moment is, like this point of difference between us at the moment, where I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: So like, if I trust you with those decisions, like why should I trust you with them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Ah-huh; in that I have this long-term view that\u2019s quite different from yours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:19:22]-[0:20:22] (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well. (pause) [0:21:22] (pause) Okay. So, I mean I think there are three parties to this \u2013 these decisions; one is me, and the other is a part of you that\u2019s quite determined to kill yourself. And then there\u2019s the rest of you, or some other part, that feels variously I think. And that\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">part that puts you sort of that pushed it off in my hands; the part of you that wants to kill yourself, I don\u2019t think trusts anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Mm-mm. [0:22:49] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: And (pause) doesn\u2019t feel (pause) like I would be acting in your interests if I didn\u2019t let you die. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I think the only thing I can really (pause) do, or the only kind of relationship I can have with that part of you, is to acknowledge it, and to acknowledge it\u2019s distrust, and anger, and (pause) importance. [0:24:12] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Mm-mm. (pause) [0:25:12] (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: What was your plan [for tonight?] (ph) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well sort of just to have it. (pause) [Kind of] (ph) before work or after work. (pause) So \u2013 yeah. (inaudible at 0:26:17) Yeah, or something else. (pause) Probably after work. (pause) [0:27:17] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you\u2019re really pissed.

I am [upset right now.] (ph) You know (pause) [0:28:24] (pause) You know, I do trust you, and I can\u2019t help but \u2013 I just feel like \u2013 (pause) I feel like that causes me suffering. (pause) I\u2019d rather you know; I\u2019d rather talk to you. (pause) [0:29:24] (pause) And that like \u2013 (pause) to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">me that feels like taking a short-term (feeling) (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Ah-huh. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: There was a quiz on BuzzFeed that\u2019s like, you know, the silly quizzes they have on there, \u201cWhich (inaudible at 0:30:01) character are you?\u201d So this one is like, \u201cWhat will your ultimate fate be?\u201d And so you answer right; questions about what band you listen to and stuff. And at the end it says, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">\u201cUltimately, you will die.\u201d (laughter) (pause) So guess if I take the really long way, it\u2019s sort of mute.

(pause) [0:32:03] (pause) Another thing with the part of you that (pause) really wants to die, and has always had, and really distrustful, (pause) it doesn\u2019t like to talk much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: More about like an (interaction) (ph).

Eventually, you have to tell me no, you can\u2019t kill yourself, in some way or another. (pause) (inaudible at 0:34:00) [I guess I\u2019ll get along here.] (ph) (pause) Plus I feel like that\u2019s sort of a shitty position for you. (pause) But not this part of me that wants to kill myself really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">cares very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s certainly been putting you in that position for years.

I think you\u2019re sort of \u2013 (pause) I think in terms of what you mean, that on one hand you feel that I (inaudible at 0:35:48), and on the other hand, not so much. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 0:36:13), not mine to deal with. (pause) What happens today? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) [0:37:13] I don\u2019t know yet. I think I sort of had different (pause) thoughts at different moments that we\u2019ve been talking. I mean (pause) there\u2019s a way I think you\u2019re actually quite relieved at the prospect yesterday of going to the hospital. I think that actually helped you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">feel better, or unclear or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it did. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: In a way I guess, (pause) you know, I think the truth is now, there\u2019s some extent to which this decision\u2019s in my hands, and some extent to which it\u2019s of course still in yours. I mean that\u2019s just reality when you\u2019re home. [0:38:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: And I think that\u2019s not true at the hospital. You know, frankly the decision there really is pretty much out of hands at that point, which I think is a relief, among other things. (pause) Then there\u2019s, there are moments where I think like, you know, you\u2019re telling me that you think you\u2019ll tell me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">It can seem a little touch and go. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. Realistically, I\u2019m like oh well. I hate it, and I don\u2019t want to. (pause) [0:39:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I guess -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a lot to ask.

(pause) Yeah. Yeah, I think it is. It puts an awful lot on you, if that\u2019s what you mean. (pause) From that (pause) [0:41:39] you\u2019d be [cared for] (ph) at the hospital also because you\u2019re (relieved) (ph) you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: And \u2013 (pause) so let\u2019s go that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Okay.
