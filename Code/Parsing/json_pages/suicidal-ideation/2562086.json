As it happens they\u2019re opening and closing right now, all the way down here [inaudible at 00:00:20]. I really [inaudible at 00:00:24] almost any of this I must look a little funny. Whatever. I don\u2019t have many people <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">around right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I\u2019m pretty far in it a lot. There\u2019s been moments and times when I can kind of pull back and say this too shall pass and things are going to get better probably. But I don\u2019t, it\u2019s hard for me to sort of have perspective most of the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I told James that things were sort of getting pretty bad. I said I don\u2019t know how bad it is. He said that looked good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yes, you told him that you don\u2019t know how bad it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yes. He kissed me and I started crying uncontrollably so that, I felt some explanation was called for. We will see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">[Pause] I really don\u2019t want to go to work but it\u2019s probably good for me, a good distraction for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me that you\u2019re both feeling pretty hopeless and uncertain and finding me as well to be pretty helpless and uncertain about as far as being able to do anything about how you feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes, I guess that\u2019s right. I just really don\u2019t want this to be happening. I really don\u2019t want to be here again. I don\u2019t want to be feeling this way and I don\u2019t want to have to deal with any of the fallout. I sort of think about the ways in which we\u2019ve handled it in the past and I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">to do any of those either. So, yes, I do feel sort of helpless. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And I can, like I said sometimes I can sort of step back and say well I\u2019m not in the same place that I was a year ago. This isn\u2019t the same and it\u2019s not the cycle that never gets better. And I have all of these factors in my life that\u2019s sort of helped me stay stable and I\u2019m better at pulling out of it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">like I\u2019m better at sort of regulating myself. But this doesn\u2019t bear a lot of weight. [Laughing] Yes, I guess, I don\u2019t know, it sort of feels like none of my choices are good right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I guess the other sense I get or that you say is that you\u2019re very frightened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I imagine either that you will be dead or that you\u2019ll go to the hospital and once there, whatever will happen in the [inaudible at 00:06:19].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just frightened that, I\u2019m frightened that this will just keep going, you know? And I\u2019ll go to the hospital and have to deal with that but then also have to deal with sort of the aftermath of that, or that I won\u2019t go to the hospital and I\u2019ll just keep feeling shitty for weeks and months. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">I think about committing suicide and I don\u2019t see any way for that not to be really, really terrible for everybody around me. And so then I think well, I guess I\u2019ll just have to feel the same way, really, really terrible for me for a while. And I don\u2019t like those choices. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yes. Eventually [inaudible at 00:07:56] are both really horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yes. And maybe I\u2019ll just turn around this week and that would be great. Except that then there\u2019s also, I\u2019d still just feel pretty helpless. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562086\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: As though this is kind of just being done to you in a way you have, you or anybody else has regular control over?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes. That\u2019s what it feels like. And <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And it can kind of come and go at any time, more or less?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. Yes. I guess I part of me really wants to say that that\u2019s not actually how it is and I do have control over it and blah, blah, blah. But I don\u2019t know about that. Part of it also is James is very uncomfortable with the fact that I feel so helpless, in fact I feel like it\u2019s just something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">that happens to me or that\u2019s done to me. And I see his point, he likes people to have agency. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">But I can still get up and go to work and do laundry and do the things that I need to do to sort of stay in the world. So, get to work. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. It sort of feels like the things that keep me stable right now or that are good in my life are contingent on my continuing to be okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You mean like work where it helps but you sort of be in good enough shape to get there kind of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes, certainly. I sort of feel that way about church stuff, not to the same extent or the same kind but I don\u2019t I feel like my role in that community is one of somebody who does stuff and is helpful and I feel like it\u2019s not easy for me to tell people there that I\u2019m really not doing well. Part <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">of that is honestly the priests there don\u2019t really follow up with me when I\u2019m not doing well and that\u2019s always sort of hurtful and disappointing. And so I don\u2019t want to put myself in a position to be hurt and disappointed. Which I guess the way to fix that is just to tell them and make it clear what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">I need. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d actually do it but that\u2019s probably feedback they should hear. [Laughing] Sorry, sort of I\u2019m thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well I think you\u2019re also in a way expressing some frustration in clearly I think in a very subjective way that I think is appropriate about other people\u2019s limitations, being able to be there for you or help you. I mean I think it\u2019s easier with the priests in a way because they\u2019re kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">bucking up. But I think, like with work and I imagine it\u2019s complicated with James or that he was sort of the third instance I\u2019m thinking of that you kind of had him to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And with me as well, I think there\u2019s a level in which it feels like none of us can really help in certain ways that would really matter. And I think there are moments that are frustrating and other ones that are scary. Or with work I guess as an example but you\u2019re going yes it does help in you\u2019re in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">good enough shape to get there. And I know you know in a way that if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s not their fault. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">But in another way I imagine it\u2019s either sad or frustrating or something that passed a certain point you\u2019re kind of on your own. There\u2019s a degree in which they can\u2019t come to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes. And you know it\u2019s not really, it\u2019s not ultimately useful to talk about the sort of specific ways in which they can\u2019t come to me because when people, when people really try to come to me and be there for me there\u2019s only so much that does. There\u2019s still that point in pass (ph), which is look, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">I just have to do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you\u2019re saying that to anyone in particular. I mean I mean me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562086\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t I was thinking about people like [Jason and] (ph) Candace that seen me last year and I said that was both nice and made me feel really loved. And also on some level it didn\u2019t really matter. I don\u2019t know who I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: [Pause] I kind of think that goes to I\u2019m trying hard to help and to be there and so it would be hard to tell me about the limitations and what it could actually do and the sort of points after which I kind of can help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean maybe I\u2019m feeling that way but you see that in my first reaction is [inaudible at 00:18:30]. You probably know pretty well the limits of what you can do [laughs].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Fair enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I feel like that would be pretty inescapable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see. I see and I guess the idea is, yes, I can see how it got to be reasonably one where I can live with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yes. That\u2019s one of the things I really trust about you. You don\u2019t seem to take it personally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: So then [inaudible at 00:19:23] take care of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I see, yes. That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s sort of like I see what you\u2019re getting at. I\u2019m just not really sure where I fit into it, how well it fits. So one of the things that I was thinking about and sort of imagining is well if I do end up having to be hospitalized again what the hell do we do? I do not I can very easy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">envision a scenario in which my treaters at the hospital got very frustrated at me because I don\u2019t seem very fond of medication and I\u2019m not particularly interested in retrying any of it if it didn\u2019t work the last time. I am not interested in doing ECT again. I\u2019m not so that sort of leaves short term, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">sort of two-week programs and you and I don\u2019t <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">So it\u2019s well basically just keep doing what we\u2019re doing is the plan and I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s something that I find sort of reassuring or scary or both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: My money\u2019s on both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: It seems like I think that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: But I mean one of the things that sort of frightens me about the idea of needing to be hospitalized is that I tend to get a lot of pushback about doing analysis like this. And I don\u2019t want to have to deal with that. I feel like I sort of get put in the position of having to sort of strongly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">defend my treatment choices and I don\u2019t and maybe I\u2019m just sort of in the position of having to strongly defend my treatment choices to myself right now and that\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking about it. But I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Okay, well it does seem like you\u2019re saying I think there\u2019s something going on which is this. So my first thought is you\u2019re talking about how others sort of play the [inaudible at 00:24:56] up on the way through. My first thought was yes, I guess Tanya\u2019s right. At the end of the day there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">sort of relatively brief hospital stays and then you take your medication, you\u2019ve done a bunch of groups and I get that\u2019s right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">And then I thought, well yes, that\u2019s true those are the options but actually there are a whole, there\u2019s a collection of [inaudible at 00:25:25] that go on around your being in the hospital and things actually do change. You tend to you get, at least so far, you\u2019ve gotten to a point where things get <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">bad to a certain degree and you say okay I\u2019m cooked; take care of me. And you go to the hospital and it\u2019s actually kind of a relief because the burden isn\u2019t as much on you to keep from killing yourself I think. You know they <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562086\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s a nice feeling. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yes, they carry that for a while and I guess they\u2019re really in a way the only ones who can. I mean you know you can call me and I\u2019ll sort of kind of take over, but it does require stepping up in some ways on your part, where the hospital I think really does it. Once you\u2019re there my sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">is it feels like they\u2019re carrying a lot of that burden. And that is a relief for a while and then you really want to get out of there. And I think then there\u2019s kind of re-entry and worry that usually that does provide, has provided some respite for you for a little while including after you\u2019ve left. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">And then you mentioned about their kind of not being happy with you for not wanting to help and also their giving you a hard time about analysis. And I guess I have two thoughts. I only remember one time that really happened but maybe it happened more than I really knew about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: I remember at least a couple of times. But both times with people who were sort of primary people in charge of my care so if they don\u2019t like it the crap sort of trickles down. And I\u2019m probably exaggerating it but it sort of looms large for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right, yes, and I think that\u2019s the piece that I was marshaled (ph) into. And I think a big reason it looms large for you is because with this as well I think you in some ways and maybe oftentimes feel taken care of. And I think you\u2019re kind of very sort of sensitive to or vulnerable around <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">people saying things that made you feel like well you\u2019re being taken care of too much. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yes. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: And so I think that\u2019s actually a similar thing with a hospital too. I think your thoughts, to me it seems like you were kind of unconsciously a little dismissive of how the hospital can actually help, can in another way make you feel a bit taken care of. So it seems to me in both instances <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">that what you seem to be kind of, I don\u2019t know, sensitive around in a way and sort of warding off a bit is, I guess, there\u2019s really a conflict around really wanting to take care of and really feeling like you need it and feeling like you\u2019re going to get in big trouble for it. So that either it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200812\">exist, the hospital\u2019s just the same as any other place, or they\u2019re going to give you shit about analysis and then you\u2019re going to have to give that up is it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes, that makes really good sense. I feel like I told James that things are pretty bad and he said you know you can ask for help and it\u2019s sort of awkward to help you with the things that you\u2019re doing [inaudible] and he said I want to let you ask for help and not sort of steamroll you. You can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">ask. And it\u2019s sort of like okay you have no idea what a barrel of worms that is. I said okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny, it may be a different expression. I know the expression I\u2019ve heard is a can of worms. But you upgraded to a barrel. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: I think I was thinking also of a barrel of monkeys or something. Yes. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562086\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s probably a bag [inaudible at 00:31:07].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yes. I think that makes me uncomfortable when you sort of suggest ways in which I might be sort of feeling hopeless or feeling frustrated about with you and kind of like this because I do feel like I really get taken care of here. I don\u2019t know how to and so then I feel like I have to sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">of explain why that is or what\u2019s going on there and I don\u2019t know the answer. [Pause crying] I don\u2019t want that to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well I appreciate your making that clear to me. It actually makes a lot of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Sorry, I\u2019m listening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s all right. The [inaudible at 00:33:04] extends. I mean I\u2019m, as you know, often say things that maybe may feel that are sort of negative or critical or hard to take. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: And I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: But I think what you\u2019re sort of saying or pointing out that seems much more central really is the ways I\u2019m there for you and take care of you and make you feel taken care of. And you\u2019re just saying how unclear how that happens or whether and when it will go away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">And so that when I [inaudible at 00:34:17] ask about does it seem like I can help you this way or can I help you that way or being frustrated this way it, let\u2019s see, well I guess it\u2019s sort of missing the point and sort of demonstrating a way that I don\u2019t get how I am helping and how much that matters, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">which makes it feel more precarious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes. I guess it feels like there\u2019s this a sort of feeling that it\u2019s on me to be able to articulate that and that\u2019s as hard or harder than telling you ways in which I frustrated you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yes, definitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: And so, yes, so I get very, very shy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yes, no I appreciate that you just did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: James asked me yesterday, he said what does Chad think about something, I don\u2019t remember exactly what it was, and I said oh we talked about it. And then I said that\u2019s a silly question, I have no idea what Chad thinks about that. And I said that\u2019s weird. Which is just to say I don\u2019t know, any <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">answer is perfectly retarded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">Yes, I guess it sort of feels like I have to be able to explain why it\u2019s important and why it helps or it will go away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You know it\u2019s possible I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m doing it again but it seems also like part of the feeling that the other person might not have a sense of, like I might not have a sense of how much I mean to you or the ways in which how something really matters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yes, so at a time like this when I\u2019m really bad I it\u2019s like things are really bad but also you\u2019re really helping and that really matters and that doesn\u2019t go away even if things are still really bad. And I feel like that sort of feels like a contradiction, it feels sort of hard to carry in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">my head. And so I worry about you being able to carry it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Right. Well here\u2019s how I understand it. And there may be things that I am missing about it but I imagine at least some of it is that the worse you feel there are fewer places you have to talk about it. And here you can talk about it. I mean you may have a hard time talking about it, you may <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">worry about talking about it, all that stuff obviously that\u2019s there but I think there\u2019s more of a chance and often a lot more opportunity. And I can see how that would at once be as beneficial or even more so when you\u2019re feeling really bad. And yet we both have this thing I can fix it or talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF2\">it will, even if it helps, make it better if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562086\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something that\u2019s also occurring to me, I don\u2019t I think it\u2019s very much a lot between you and me and very important. It sort of has also occurred to me for whatever that you\u2019ve been talking but there are things about this that seem to me to have you and your mom written all over them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: About your wanting help and just feeling like she didn\u2019t know how much she mattered to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Oh. That makes a lot of sense. Yes. Sort of hard for me to think about it directly because I get panicked that it\u2019ll all go away. It (ph) gets in the way. If I don\u2019t think about it too much I don\u2019t worry about it too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">I don\u2019t know.
