James is so angry with me, but he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, probably because it makes it like this, and so it\u2019s just always there. And I want to take care of him, but as far as I can tell, he thinks that I\u2019m flaky and untrustworthy and incapable <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">of taking care of him in the ways that he needs and asks for. And as far as I can tell, he\u2019s pretty much right. [1:25] I don\u2019t blame him. And I\u2019m not really sure that that\u2019s like, I mean it\u2019s obviously me worse today, but I was already pretty shitty to start out with. Like, yesterday was also a terrible day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 1:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So it is sort of an easy and sitting around sort of day. I don\u2019t feel like it. [2:10] It\u2019s a hermit moment, which is fine when watching TV. I\u2019ll stop watching TV eventually. It\u2019s so hard. God. It\u2019s so hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: In my mind you really want to be dead. [3:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like, I just it not to be so hard. I can sort of feel like my mind wanting to be dead and the wanting to hurt myself and wanting different things. It\u2019s like, maybe this would make it easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: You just don\u2019t want it to be like this, hurting this bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. (crying) And I feel it would actually be easier if I were more suicidal in sort of a paradoxical way. Like, it doesn\u2019t really feel like an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: You get all excited about that or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Something like that. [4:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I also \u2013 kind of backing up. But there was something in our interaction about the flowers where when I said, gee, sometimes I do answer questions, I felt as I was saying it, I realized I was saying something that was somehow quite hurtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It\u2019s definitely not helpful. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: What started \u2013 You asked why they were over there and I explained. And I guess I had the vague impression that, and this may be completely off base, that there was something painful in my explanation? [5:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: All right. Maybe you were just feeling bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I was just feeling bad, I think. It does really bother me that you don\u2019t answer questions. That is painful for me. So today, at least, being flippant about it was a little bit painful. Sometimes it makes it less painful to be flippant about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but I get your point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: No, I think I\u2019m just hurting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m sorry I was flippant. I know that\u2019s not all the main thing, but it\u2019s also the truth. (pause) 6:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what to say. I feel like anything I say is just going to make it hurt more. I was talking with a person I know from church yesterday. We were going to visit somebody who\u2019s \u2013 she\u2019s 89 and she\u2019s just stuck in her apartment, so we\u2019re taking her to (inaudible at 7:46) and I sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">mentioned the depression. And he said, what does depression feel like. I said, well, that\u2019s a very good question. He was very kind in asking it, but I didn\u2019t really answer in a way that felt satisfactory to me. I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. I certainly don\u2019t know how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">describe it when I\u2019m not in it specifically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">I can say, this is what I\u2019m feeling right now. At that moment I was more thinking about the person we were going to see and what we had to do to get that. And the fact that the guy \u2013 he was a really distracted driver. [8:35] He ran a red light in Denver. I was like, red light, red light, red light. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">You know, like, I feel like everybody who\u2019s lived in Denver for a while that I end up driving with ends up just sort of wandering from lane to lane, not really paying much attention to staying in a specific lane or being courteous or any of that. So that\u2019s kind of fine, so I kept expecting him to stop. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">No, he didn\u2019t. I feel like on another day that would have made me very nervous and anxious. [9:24] (pause) I went to a housewarming party on Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562456\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: You had mentioned that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. I really didn\u2019t want to go up until about five minutes before I left. But I went. It was okay. A couple I know from church, or I know one of the men from church and the other, I didn\u2019t know him before. [10:53] They have an entire room for shoes. It\u2019s a small room, but still. They\u2019ve got <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">an entire room for one guy\u2019s shoes. My friend, Jack just gets the big closet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 11:26) both feet? (pause) [12:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Today we had to take a bus to (inaudible at 13:06) which is fun, it\u2019s just that it was significantly colder than I expected. It was colder than I expected. I wasn\u2019t quite dressed for it. And the busses as they so often are, were delayed. So we ended up on the way back, it was like, 25 minutes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">before the bus came. It\u2019s like, this exceeds expensive, because it\u2019s going to feel like nine minutes or something. And I was so cold. We got back home, and I just couldn\u2019t get warm. I took a half hour shower, really, really hot. [13:55] It was just a miserable morning. I was like, really? I feel horrible. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">I don\u2019t like dealing with weather like that. It\u2019s a lot to bear. (pause) [14:51] I feel like somehow two or three people have chosen this weekend to e-mail me to be like, hey, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time. Let\u2019s get together for coffee. My friend from Brown is coming to town in a week or two. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B3\">like these people a lot and I just want to hide under the covers. (pause) [15:59] And it feels like now if I act as though I\u2019m hurting, James will take that as a sign that it\u2019s not okay to be angry at me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m happy about. I\u2019m pretty pissed off about it, actually. I don\u2019t know. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B4\">I just feel like just closing off more. Like, I tried to shield him from how hurt I am and he tries to shield me from how angry he is. [17:20] (pause) I\u2019m so tired. I wish there were something you could do. [18:36] (crying) So I hope your weekend was good. [19:23] I guess this feels like a lot on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I was actually thinking you seem really wary of putting or somewhat wary of putting these things on me. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not at all. (pause) I mean, it seems to me you\u2019re sort of maybe struggling around that, wanting to put a lot more it out there or on me and also you maybe not wanting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">to do. [20:46] I imagine with things with James about having to do with how bad you\u2019re feeling and things to do with you and me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: It sort of feels like talking about the things that are really hard for me and that I have to think about them. It just feels like too much. [21:54] (crying) (pause) [23:05] I guess it sort of feels like I study very carefully everything that comes crashing down upon me. (pause) [24:20] Before <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">James, it\u2019s like I know that there\u2019s all this hurt and anger there and I can\u2019t stand sort of like frozenness that comes from not talking about it. So I just poke him until like sure, to say to talk about it. And sure enough, he\u2019s very angry and very hurt. So it destroys me. I feel like maybe I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">have just left it where I was. [25:37] I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how to fix it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562456\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I can see that you can\u2019t bear either one. To have him frozen with this and to sort of know in your head anyway that it\u2019s there. Or, to have him stressed at you or put it out there or something which you can\u2019t stand either. [26:54] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: But I continue to not hurt myself. I\u2019m a little surprised at that, to be honest. But I am. I don\u2019t know why I feel like there\u2019s a wing here. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s actually better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Not to. [28:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: James and I have to talk. I don\u2019t want to be mad with him about it and I\u2019m really mad at myself about it. I think a lot about like, us being stuck with regard to James\u2019s job and I obsess a lot on that. [29:46] (pause) [30:45] [31:37] It bothers me that James won\u2019t let me help him, but I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">even cook dinner. Or I don\u2019t, anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I think you might feel James is actually terribly untrustworthy. [33:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I do feel like I receive very mixed messages from him about how far it\u2019s okay for me to lean on him. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: At least, as I heard it from you, he had reassured you about that, and then later actually thought about leaving over it. My sense is that\u2019s somewhat in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: And it feels like the same thing is happening again. I worry that going to the hospital \u2013 going back to the hospital with this huge breach of trust. And I feel like he told me first that this time was different and it was okay, and then when it wasn\u2019t okay. I don\u2019t know what he thinks. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">know what to believe. [34:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: I know also that you have been it seems like, really on edge about whether or when you\u2019ll move. [35:24] And in a way he hasn\u2019t followed through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: (crying) [36:39] Well, you\u2019ve got something there. I don\u2019t know what. [37:39] (pause) I\u2019m still upset about that, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in a particularly defensible position either. You sort of say, well how important is it for us to stay in Denver. I think that sort of changes depending <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">on how I\u2019m doing that day. [38:19] I love saying that like, no, no. He really just needs to figure this shit out. He just needs to do something. I can\u2019t even talk to him about it anymore. (pause) [39:45] (pause) [40:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I imagine that there are a couple of things, those that are going through my mind, a couple about that. One is sort of the nail-biting aspect of it where you\u2019re like, really anxious and worked up and upset and on edge and all of that. And you really don\u2019t feel that you can really bring it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">up with him at all. [42:00] I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m just saying whatever that\u2019s \u2013 which is that. So I guess what came to my mind is just of you feeling kind of shoved in a closet with this. So it\u2019s really affecting you clearly, quite a lot. And again, I\u2019m not trying to make a case that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">can or should talk to about him, because I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just saying in terms of how it sounds like it is for you right now in recent weeks, in the last couple of months, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562456\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s mostly coming from me rather than from him. Because the thing is like, when I have talked to him about it, I don\u2019t get anywhere with it. It\u2019s not that he minds me bringing it up, but he doesn\u2019t particularly like it and he doesn\u2019t have anything to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: So then it goes nowhere. [43:06] The other thing that crossed my mind is like, that you will be talking and I don\u2019t know, maybe thinking about losing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s really hard and it is \u2013 it\u2019s something that I feel like, if I knew we had to do, I could figure out how to reconcile myself to it. But since I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something I have to do, there\u2019s just this anxiety about it. If it were a real thing, I could figure it out. I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">figure out how to make it okay. It\u2019s just this thing hanging over me. [44:18] (crying) James doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s asking me to do. He can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean it as a slight against him. But I imagine he doesn\u2019t and if you haven\u2019t done something like this before, it\u2019s not really in your culture, you just don\u2019t know. [44:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: And I knew it before. It\u2019s not even a question. I\u2019m just scared that what it\u2019s coming down to is that I\u2019m going to have to choose with this relationship and my relationship with James. And that\u2019s not a choice I want to make. [45:40] But I can\u2019t tell James that that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m just scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: We have to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
