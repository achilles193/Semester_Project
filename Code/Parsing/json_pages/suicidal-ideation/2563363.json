He was like, \u201cI walk very slowly.\u201d Thank you, sir. Kindly. What a kind fellow. Ginny is gone. She went away yesterday and she\u2019ll be back later in the week. She\u2019s in Chicago on business. I\u2019ve been getting into some of the habits which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">I do often when she goes. I ordered the wrong pizza, ordered the wrong wings.  It\u2019s a little too spicy for me in the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You do that on purpose? You order different food?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Kind of. It\u2019s kind of like \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 one of those little defiance things I\u2019m not supposed to do. Not that she would stop me if she were there. She might, at worse, be like \u201cyou\u2019re sure ordering a lot of spicy things lately.\u201d I might then say \u201cyeah.\u201d She might be like, \u201cIsn\u2019t that bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">for your stomach?\u201d out of concern. I would be like \u201cyeah.\u201d It\u2019s like four sentences out of life that I don\u2019t have to use. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something like you not having the watching eye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Ginny is one of those more judgment-free creatures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I realize. Nonetheless . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Nonetheless. Nonetheless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: The difference between having somebody watching. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I\u2019m watching movies. I tried to watch Matrix Reloaded and I was like it does not stand up. The special effects were pushing the boundaries of CGI at that point and still weren\u2019t quite good enough. Now I haven\u2019t seen [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:17). No, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t just watch some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">poorly-animated cartoon run around and fight a bunch of dudes. I\u2019m here to see a movie, not a CGI flick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: So it really doesn\u2019t even hold the plot? That\u2019s amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Nor does the fighting even. You can see Keanu Reeves inexperience now. The Matrix opened the door to the west for stuff like Crouching Tiger and that sort of genre of real [Bushu] (ph?). Once you\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s like, oh, okay. Keanu Reeves. I see.  What are you doing? And you can see, as <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">well, he\u2019s very clearly unmatched by a lot of his opponents they\u2019re bringing in. There is that one guy who is like, \u201cI\u2019m only here to fight you so that I can be like \u2013 ta-da, we fought. Now that we fought I\u2019ll show you where the oracle is. I had to be sure you were the one and I can only know this when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">we\u2019re fighting.\u201d They just hired a famous guy to fight. That\u2019s sweet. We\u2019re having a fight scene. Come on. I thought there were a lot of missed opportunities with The Matrix movies, second and third. Apparently that woman who wrote the Matrix novel finally got some restitution from the Coen brothers <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">from them plagiarizing it into a movie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: There was some talk of it being almost urban legend, but apparently she\u2019s gotten her just restitution, but the Coen brothers and whoever fucking made The Matrix, the Coen brothers, those other dudes.  They had actually seen a crappy novel that had gotten released and were \u201cOh, we like this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">Let\u2019s make it into a movie.\u201d She was like \u201cWhat the fuck? That\u2019s my not-very-well-known book.\u201d They were like, \u201cYeah, we thought we could get away with it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563363\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: They didn\u2019t buy the rights from her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: No, no. They just went and did it. They didn\u2019t think anyone would be like, \u201cHey \u2013 you can\u2019t take my book. Who the fuck are you?\u201d \u201cWe made The Matrix. We invented [bullet-time] (ph?) technology.\u201d The Matrix is still a fantastic movie. They didn\u2019t do CGI in The Matrix. They didn\u2019t CGI their fights. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">It was all wire work, like real Bushu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Bushu is what? Hong Kong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s a style in the movie. Hong Kong was like Chinese; Korean, there is a lot of it as well.  The Eastern style was very flashy, intricate martial arts. Fight choreography is sort of complicated and fast and stylish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Hands on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Exactly and it is advanced. Kung Fu is way advanced. If someone has training in Kung Fu and you have no training, they have a significant advantage over you in a fight. But if they\u2019re trained in Kung Fu and you\u2019re trained in just about anything else that\u2019s not fantasy-based, you\u2019ve got a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">strong advantage over them because you\u2019ve learned how to fight while they want to dance, and you don\u2019t want to bring dance to a fight party unless you\u2019re incredibly good; unless you\u2019re one of those secret masters who can transfer the knowledge of one specialized form they\u2019ve studied and suddenly their <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">opponent would be on the ground. As you have seen in various fights with []. You can\u2019t. Kung Fu does not have any application inside combat sports. People who come in and are like, \u201cYep, I\u2019ve got this mastery of various styles and forms and ancient traditions,\u201d it doesn\u2019t stand up if someone is tackling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">you and punching you in the face.  You have no defense for that; and that\u2019s the first thing they\u2019re going to try to do \u2013 or one of the things. Maybe if they\u2019ll stand up and box you. They\u2019ll probably do kickboxing. They\u2019re probably trained specifically to fight people in a ring or they\u2019re in an octagon, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200354\">which you\u2019ve learned that they would counter with various moves that these people don\u2019t know. They\u2019re just going to keep trying to punch you in the head and the body. And if that doesn\u2019t work, if they can\u2019t expose that game, then they\u2019re going to try to take it to the ground. No matter how bad they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200355\">are on the ground, now they know they\u2019re better than you on the ground. Fantasy martial arts. You do see occasional people like Lyoto Machida who comes in with a very traditional karate background. He actually fights blade and stance a lot of times, which is just considered absolute taboo by any modern <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200356\">fighting standards.  Like the stances you see in the Karate Kid movies and all those formal karate movies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s blade and stance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. With my hand I can do this and I come across with a cross, but I present less targets for my body for my opponent, which is one thing I kind of knew. But you often have to bring your feet together when you want to move or, perhaps, cross your feet when you want to move, which puts you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">at a real disadvantage. Your front-leg kick is only going to be so good. You can keep some distance and you do some stuff. Not much. You can side kick, but sidekicks are easier to see coming if you\u2019re a real fighter. If you have a fast side kick \u2013 awesome \u2013 and faster.  But still you have this one jab <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">and the problem is that when you want to cross, you have to come across your entire body from way back here. You give up two weapons for the slight advantage of being harder to punch directly in the face or directly in the kidney. But the other guy has full weapons and he\u2019s still defending against your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">two just as easily. He\u2019s got everything in this fight and you\u2019ve got two things. If you\u2019re bladed and he wants to take to the ground, you\u2019re going to go to the ground. This guy is very traditional and has done karate since he was three years old, but then he also studies Jujitsu which is, basically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200394\">octagon boxing. He fights bladed often and he can do it. He\u2019s very, very good at it, but that\u2019s not exclusively what he does. Were it, he wouldn\u2019t have done as well as he does.  In fact, while very dangerous for a long time, he\u2019s not as dangerous as he used to be. He pulled off the Karate Kid [crane <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200395\">kick] (ph?), the flying crane kick technique in one fight with it. That was magical. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the crane technique; that\u2019s a flying back-front kick \u2013 wham. You see the tooth in slow motion fly out of the guy\u2019s face. He still hasn\u2019t found it by the end of the announcement parts. [Randy Couture] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200396\">(sp?) is my favorite fighter of all time. They\u2019re like, \u201cAre you going to fight again?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m done.\u201d The guy was like 37 at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563363\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Who was the guy that just got his leg wrecked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: That was Silva. He got turned around. He\u2019s been in a couple of small movies, like The Expendibles, here and there.  He was a fighter and a gentleman. He would talk to talk some smack for the fight, but mostly on technical points. He would be like, \u201cHis boxing is very sloppy so I\u2019m not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">worried about that. I know that my Greco-Roman skills will win out over his at any point in time, so very likely I\u2019ll take him to the ground and beat him up, and that\u2019s going to be the end of the fight. That\u2019s what I think. Sorry.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: What do you like about him? What do you like about Couture?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Just that he was [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:35). No big deal. \u201cI out boxed him in this fight\u201d or \u201che wasn\u2019t good enough on the ground; I was better.\u201d You\u2019ve heard of Bill Belichick \u2013 sort of without that gruffness to him. It\u2019s more like, \u201cThis is why I won; this is why he lost.\u201d It has nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">to do with him as a person. This is a sport we both play and I\u2019m very good at it.  I remember there was this younger guy at the time who is now a fight manager for Women\u2019s UFC, Tito Ortis, who was a big deal because he was really heavy up top and he could get to the ground and then he could just slam <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">you in the face over and over again \u2013 just speed and power and ferocity. For a long time it was very hard for people to defend against that. That was the real ground and pound when that became a very viable technique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Get someone to the ground and just . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, if you can get them on the ground and you can definitely throw shots at them for a long time. That\u2019s very advantageous, but he had so much power in that position and he had so much weight he would just lean forward on you and you couldn\u2019t buck him \u2013 unstoppable, completely unstoppable <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">once the [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:49) was over. He was terrifying and so people had to learn a lot. How do we deal with a really aggressive ground and pounder?  That changed the sport some more, as well. He wanted to fight Randy Couture because Randy Couture was the best in the world. He was like, \u201cYeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">I\u2019ll fight you.\u201d At that point he was like, \u201cYou\u2019re ten years younger than I am, a good guy. You\u2019re top heavy,\u201d whereas Couture has a fighter\u2019s body, evenly distributed muscle mass across his whole body. Ortis was always talking some crazy shit because that\u2019s what he does. He\u2019s not the smartest guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200453\">in the world. He just loves to talk shit because he has, so far, beaten the crap out of everybody. (inaudible at 00:12:35) fighter ever born. Randy is like, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s young. He thinks he\u2019s incredibly good. He\u2019s definitely got some dangerous moves and some power, but I think ultimately he doesn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200454\">the skills to take me out.\u201d And so in the fight, at one point he\u2019s trying to ground pound Randy and he can\u2019t get Randy on the ground. Randy is just like, \u201cI\u2019m just a better wrestler. You can\u2019t put me on the ground if I don\u2019t want to be there.  And if we do get on the ground, very unlikely that you will <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200455\">end up on top. I\u2019m going to get up and I\u2019m going to box you because I\u2019m a better boxer.\u201d So at one point, in desperation Ortis gives it up trying to do it with an arm bar. He gives it everything he has with this arm bar, but he\u2019s got it wrong. Randy is just standing there while Ortis is putting all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200456\">his power into trying to bend his arm the wrong way. Randy is standing up a little bent over because the guy has his arm. He looks at the camera and is like, this is wrong. He can\u2019t possibly get arm-barred from there and he has no idea. So he starts spanking Tito. He starts slapping his ass. He\u2019s smiling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200457\">at the camera, just spanking him. (laughs) Like what do you want me to do right now? This kid doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. And then he beats the crap out of Tito Ortis and wins.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563363\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Almost like he was teaching him a lesson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, teaching him a little lesson. You\u2019re not anywhere near as awesome as you think you are.  You surprised a lot of people. They tried to do a similar thing with Couture and Brock Lesnar in super heavyweight, which is unfair. That\u2019s basically whatever weight you are is whatever weight you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">are. Rock is a huge, huge dude \u2013 bigger than Couture. Couture boxed him and fought him for a long time. He did a great job. He got punched once in the head and the fight was over. They were like, \u201cWhy did you go down?\u201d He was like, \u201cHe\u2019s a huge guy. He punched me straight in the head once. That\u2019s what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">it took.\u201d Simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: One clear shot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. All he needed was one good shot and the fight was over. At the time he was just to outbox him before he got that one in, because that\u2019s all you can do. That\u2019s the best you can do. Mass wins unless you can out-skill mass. Unless you can out-skill mass, it\u2019s going to beat you.  But those <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">are fighters. I\u2019ve been watching some great stuff trying to fight like Aikido in an MMA where Aikido practitioners are like, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t stand up to fighters. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lots of what Aikido does is I will evade and I will use your own momentum against you, but really in an octagon you can\u2019t run far enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563363\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re telling you this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, I watch videos on this. These are Aikido style stuff. And it\u2019s unfortunate. They get hurt badly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: Oh, people who use that style.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: People who use Aikido, any of the Kung Fu, any of the Aikido. Any of the magical, incredible stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s not enough room?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: There is not enough room to run away. There is also no real answer for jabs. Aikido is where I take big swings at you and I throw you around. Aikido might be great self-defense for if someone tries to grab you in the street. You throw him off and run.  [Or something close happens you get a joint <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200591\">walk.] (ph?) They have effective things. Everything has to be effective; but in a ring, it\u2019s not. You can\u2019t do joint walks. It\u2019s like [ ] (inaudible at 00:16:15). So, you\u2019re [ ] (inaudible at 00:16:16). How much [ ] do you use in the ring? Well, not much. [ ] eye gouging and front kicking and breaking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200592\">of things. I\u2019m a kickboxer when I get in there with a fucking hell of a front kick. Once he got into the middle of the ring, the guy goes flying with his feet back as far as he can and bounces off the octagon almost half the distance. Maybe a third of the distance back from where the guy originally <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200593\">kicked him, a ridiculous body shot. Again, he\u2019s like, [\u201cIn the O.C. I do this, but in Krav I do this whole other thing. I don\u2019t do the Krav; Krav isn\u2019t for fighting, Krav] (ph?)n is for running away and going home, which is true. That\u2019s what they even tell you. They teach you two things. They teach <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200594\">you self-defense, which is for when someone attacks you by surprise and you end up fighting for a few seconds and you run like hell. And then we teach fighting, which you should never be in. If you ever get in this position, you\u2019ve fucked up very badly. You were squaring off with someone else. You need <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200595\">kick-boxing for that, dirty kick-boxing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Mostly stay out of the fight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, don\u2019t get into the fight. Fighting is dangerous, very dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It is really self-defense as opposed to an offense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: Hitting you quickly enough and hard enough to make you not want to chase me. So when I run, you\u2019re not going to chase me, just so the other guy doesn\u2019t want that experience again.  Hunter Otis (sp?), a friend of mine, did a very traditional Tai kwon do stuff through high school and some college <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">and then he lapsed from doing it, so he lost his skills and many years have gone by since he\u2019s actually done any of it. One day he\u2019s walking home in not the best neighborhood. These two kids grab him from an alley and throw him into an alley and start throwing punches at him. He\u2019s got a big, puffy coat <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">on, so he was absorbing some shock with it. He got a couple of shots in and the people started covering up. And as soon as they started covering up, he just started throwing elbows like crazy and he caught one or two in there. But that was enough, they ran. They were like, \u201cOh, okay. If you\u2019re actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200613\">going to hit back we don\u2019t want any part of this.\u201d Especially when you start throwing elbows. It\u2019s like \u2013 oh, elbows; someone has training. We\u2019re fighting a person who has training. (laughs) They quickly run. Elbows can end fights. Elbows can end fights very quickly. Quick, light elbows can just rip <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200614\">this open and rip this open, if you get lucky.  If this is open, then the fight is over quickly.

It\u2019s over his eye; fight\u2019s over. He won\u2019t be able to fight. You see people start to lose the loss of an eye in a fight.

Self-defense more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I like it. I\u2019ve been watching some BJJ stuff because that\u2019s the next thing I need to study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Brazilian Jujitsu, which is pretty much shown once you hit the ground.  That\u2019s what you need to know. If you don\u2019t understand that, then you\u2019re smashed at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s how to fight when somebody is on the ground with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes, how to stay out of that and, once you\u2019re there, how to control someone until you decide to take them out or break their arm or whatever, to be in control of that situation. And it\u2019s great for one-on-one and that sort of thing. When it\u2019s multiple people, you have to use [Krav] (ph?) techniques <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">first and escape. (pause) People always say in the fight take out the biggest guy first; take out the alpha guy who is in your face. Some advice from some of the videos from guys who have actually been in a lot of street fights have been like \u201cwhat if people show up and they want to kick your ass?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200712\">He was like, \u201cReally what you do is know who is the big guy and then when the second is over the side, I\u2019m looking for the big guy who\u2019s talking to me and \u2013 wham \u2013 knock out the second. A one-hand shot immediately and then come back with the other hand and smash the alpha and then run.\u201d At that point, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200713\">the rest of them are like, \u201cThose were the two guys. That was the front.\u201d [Sharkey] (sp?) has another theory which is like if there is a smallest dude and you can just rush him and beat the crap out of him, just blow through him. (laughs) Smash up the smallest dude immediately. [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:54) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200714\">That can work really well, too, because people are like \u201cI\u2019m not much bigger than that guy.\u201d  Really, a couple of quick strikes just to make them think that maybe it\u2019s not worth chasing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s making me think about and noticing that you\u2019re talking about fighting a lot \u2013 or maybe I sort of captured it as that \u2013 it made me think about Ginny being away and you talking about how when she\u2019s gone, the house just feels a little less safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: It does.

I find that this weed is more potent than I expected. It lasts far longer than I expect it to \u2013 hours. Hours different. It was recommended that I smoke it very sparingly.

Honestly, not to have to eat is great. I remember in Lisbon eating stuff over there and being like, \u201cI understand for the first time why people would eat intentionally.\u201d The food over there was so good. It was so good.  Was I smoking weed there? Yes, certainly, but I\u2019ve eaten <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">food while stoned before and not been like \u201cthis is the best shit in the world.\u201d I\u2019m a pro at that sort of stuff.

I walked parts of the city at night that were not terribly populated, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200991\">but also not terribly unpopulated, not too late.

They just don\u2019t really care which coffee shop you smoke it in as long as you do. Most people smoke weed out front <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">of them and there was one where there was this nice caf\u00e9 area and you smoke a joint and these two little American girls come walking up, \u201cYou can\u2019t be smoking.

What I go for is what weed is supposed to be because there are optimal conditions outside. It\u2019s much milder and clearer and it\u2019s better. It\u2019s more predictable.

If you need to go somewhere to a few days, you can go somewhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201451\">for a few days.\u201d [ ] (inaudible at 00:50:27) I won\u2019t go to a place that won\u2019t let me out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20144-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20144-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563363\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20147\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t want to keep you.

[ ] (inaudible at 00:51:04) as you were on Friday, but it won\u2019t stop and it won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m thinking about the screwdriver, but I\u2019m in a state where I might keep pushing. And what if I then puncture? Then what happens? <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201491\">[ ] (inaudible at 00:51:21) I go over in my mind all those things. I was trying to save myself and have to keep pressure on it and dial 911 with the other hand, which is possible. Figure out which direction the blood is going and try above or below the wound.

I told Ginny I want this to be about me. It\u2019s not about my bullshit and she doesn\u2019t have to feel solely responsible as if she\u2019s the only thing in the world that keeps me alive. That\u2019s bullshit. I keep me alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you do.
