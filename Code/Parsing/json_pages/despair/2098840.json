[Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: I think...I suppose it has seemed to me at times like your depression is slipping in to sort of this...kick the shit out of you in every possible way. And defeats everything you try to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: I just [inaudible 28:01].

[Pause.] And the next question for me is why? Why would you be so dead set against feeling better; against [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F2\">34:43] what's really going on and again, what it's really like. And I'm not sure, but probably had something to do with some kind of very profound like loss that you feel and that sort of...having people be closer actually makes you feel more so. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">[36:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: One example of the first part that's coming to my mind is from a couple of weeks ago three weeks ago maybe now. It was that Tuesday when you, I think must be when you and I met and you had ECT, and then you kind of decided after that that you really needed to be in the hospital. When <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200951\">we had talked, you were hopeful that the ECT would help you feel better and then it didn't. Do you remember at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, I mean I'm pretty sure I have my facts straight on it because I remember thinking at the time you had said to me that day as well when you'd done it before, it seemed like the ECT was helping. Not stupendously, but it was making a difference you thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, now I remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and then you're feeling really crummy that morning. Your were like I'm going to have ECT and I had asked does it tend to help right away or does it take a while, and I think you referred to their being kind of lift usually fairly soon after. We didn't talk until a day or later, a day <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D1\">or maybe two later, maybe three because you were back in the hospital, but if I recall, you made it clear that you didn't feel any better. You couldn't have if, you know, the decision was made talking to a doctor there that you really needed to be back in the hospital and that was the best thing. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D2\">I remember thinking at the time, gosh, it's almost like you kind of had to show yourself it wasn't working or for the depression it could be stronger. I know it probably sounds a little crazy thing to say, but it was almost like, you know, you were starting to lean on a little bit and you started to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D3\">appreciate getting some help on this. And it's almost like you kind of had to make a point, thus showing yourself, that it wasn't going to work. It wasn't going to help. It was that day, you know; I mean, it doesn't, in a way, mean that it doesn't help at all or can help, but I think, in a way, it may <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D4\">be kind of determined to show that it wasn't going to be stronger than the depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098840\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: That makes sense.

Like I wonder things like historically is there way that sort of being depressed growing up was one of the truest things you can do. You know, like... [Pause.] You know in other ways you sort of complying and trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">to be or like find, at least not to make noise, or maybe [inaudible 42:33] sort of, I don't know, maybe felt like pretty [inaudible 42:41] in the machinery there and feeling pretty powerless and, you know; I wonder if being depressed is one of the ways you can kind of be honest and also show that; <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A32\">and also in a way be very powerful that nobody is going to take that away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: That's for sure.
