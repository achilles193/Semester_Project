(pause from  to ) It was really bad. (pause  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Most of the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Does the sadness feel pretty monolithic and disconnected and not caused by X, Y or Z. Not made better or worse by X, Y or Z?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's just kind of there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause from  to ) I, it's complicated but I think that one aspect of both the, your ongoing thoughts on suicide and the kind of undifferentiated quality of the sadness, is to disguise, more particular ways that you feel and think that you think. I'm not doubting in any way that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">are feeling as suicidal as you have been, or as bad as you have been. But I think, for example, this suicidal thought function both is a signal and a symptom. Signal is mostly saying ouch, I cannot bear this anymore. That's the communicative aspect of it in a way. I think it's like, you want to be dead <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">because you hurt so much, and you don't think it's going to be any different and the reasonable thing is to be dead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">Just like somebody who has some advanced stage of cancer and is only going to get worse, or only going to lose their mind, and only going to go on tons of drugs, it's only going to cost everybody a lot of money and resources, so like, you know, it's arguably, reasonably they decide okay, let's pull <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">the plug. My impression is that there is a part of you that is like that. It hurts so badly and you don't see it changing, so you've just had enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">But I think that's not all. I think there's also a way in which, focusing on, as far as the communicative goes and as far as the safety goes, focusing on suicide is important. But I think it can also sort of drown out other things. In some other, I think, feeling like the depression is for its all practical <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">purposes, purely biological in some sense. It is just some kind of (inaudible). I'm sure there's a biological component to it, I'm not saying otherwise. But, then it's like, this kind of ongoing thing, that's irrespect, relatively irrespective of circumstances and (pause) the same most of the time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">it isn't. I think there is something that how it feels as though it is, but it's like a bit of a disguise, or a bit of a defense against the more particular aspects of it, and of what hurts you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(pause from  to  What are your thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don't know.

That's it's going to violent, and bloody. I know you said something about, it's practical because that's quick. I think we (inaudible) some things. You know, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">time to take pills or hang yourself or something like that. But it seems like maybe there's also something about it, that's violent and bloody. (pause) I'm jumping, it's partly about self-hatred. Do you have any thoughts about what it could be about? What it is about the thoughts that strike you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: (pause from  to ) I have no idea. (pause from  to  I don't know.

(pause) Like, as though you were a grad student and working on your thesis or paper and kind of always handing your head, I hate to come with a really macabre example (chuckles).

(pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Do you know how it feels to have a flare like that? For example, if it was a thesis, you could be, gosh it makes me feel stressed, it makes me feel like whatever I'm doing I'm really not doing what I'm supposed to be doing, which is the thesis. Or it could be, well, I've seen other thesis, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">probably because it's interesting, I'm really in to it at this point and I kind of can't wait to get back to it. Or, there's this feeling of dread, I know I'm going to have to sit down with it, and I just feel it and I feel the dread all the time whenever I'm thinking about it. Do you feel dread, do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200652\">you feel fear, do you feel sense of security, do you feel...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I feel mostly interested. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: As in like, you are thinking about it and you are thinking this is something you are interested in doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (voice breaks) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: As though it were, in some sense any other activity that you were free to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: So that's mostly what you are feeling now?

Like with Amanda for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: There's a (pause), it's some combination of distraction, and (pause) I guess that's it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: You what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: It's mostly just a distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: I see. I would have guessed that it's a bit of support, but maybe that's not right. (pause) I mean I'm not trying to put a happy face on it, I just, I don't know. But your impression is that it's mostly a distraction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause from  to ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Have they given you someone else to focus on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I'm wondering if you are having a hard time remembering how you feel from one day to the next. For example, when you tell me today about thinking about suicide a lot, and picturing it a lot, and thinking of the things that you could do to yourself, and feeling really, really sad, through <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">today. You haven't said that the other days this week, and last week I think you said a couple of times, you felt the ECT was helping. So, this leaves me a little confused about, and I can imagine a few scenarios. One is, see, I imagine where there are sometimes when you're thinking about suicide going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B2\">really bad, that you might have mentioned or with James you don't talk about it as much as you're feeling it. I think with me, you try to, when you are really feeling it, I think you try like today to come in and put it out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: I try to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: That is my impression so, when you say something like today you are feeling that, I don't know if you are sad or the implication is that this has been an ongoing thing. For a long time. That leaves me wondering have you not been saying it, or are you misremembering that now, or are you dissociated <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">it from it on other days? (inaudible) we really haven't seen much. Does it make sense why I'm confused?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I can tell you my hunch. But you actually might know, so if you have a thought ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don't know. I really don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Do you have an idea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: (pause from  to  I'm not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: My sort of tentative suspicion, or hunch is that you're depression is very good at making you forget in a particular way. Like, its sort of props include a conviction that it's always the way it is when you feel really bad. Don't get me wrong, I know it's often been just, you've told me often <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB1\">that it's been like that, or it's been really awful, I don't mean to say it's been like that (inaudible). But I think your depression is pretty good at making you feel like it's always been like that. Over the last few weeks, I can tell you, it, that's not what you've said. I mean, you've told me at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB2\">a number of points, even I think at the end of last week, although you were quiet, that you felt like the ECT was working and things weren't as bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098868\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">You know, you weren't like skipping around, but it wasn't like this. It's a little more ambiguous than yesterday and Tuesday, at least for me. Because you were very quiet, but I suspect that if you had been, you sound worried about the suicidality now. Sometimes you are. I think if you had been as worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">or more worried yesterday or Tuesday you would probably, as you did today, have said something about it. So like, I don't think it's as though you are thinking about it 75 percent of the time now and you were thinking about it 5 percent of the time yesterday or Tuesday. It seems like you crossed some, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD2\">like I said, you crossed some threshold, but that part of how that happens for you, is that when it happens, you feel like it's actually always been there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">Another possibility would be that, it is there and you are disassociated from it. And then it sort of comes back but you're not as ... I don't think that's what it is. I mean, I've seen that before, but I don't think that's what's going on with you. I think that it's more like kind of a trick the depression <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">plays to make you feel like it's always at the absolute worst, all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: To make me think that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah and if it were just my own sort of intuition that it felt that for other times, I trust what you said more.
