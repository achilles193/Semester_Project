Yeah, it doesn't matter. It's just, I don't know. I kind of really don't know what to do about ECT I don't know. I guess I should do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(pause from  to ) So my friend Gerry visited this weekend.

(pause) Yeah, it wasn't the best visit. (pause) But I don't know. She and I get along really well. So that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I feel like I'm just a mess. I need to be looking for a job more. Like, a lot more, and I don't, I just don't know what to do. I was supposed to, I was supposed to be at our church on Sunday, and somehow I just didn't get the schedule, like I didn't know I was supposed to do it, and missed it, and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">all of this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That's really unlike you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Doesn't feel unlike me though, feels pretty much exactly like me.

(pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: So, (pause) what I'm thinking is that, you blame the kind of, the incompetence or like, messiness on feeling bad. I mean like, you've got these sort of very painful, depressive feelings. Sort of sad and angry and want to kill yourself and all that stuff is making you a screw up. You can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">sort of do the things you are supposed to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I guess. I don't know. (pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Do you know what you are thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: (pause) Not really. (pause from  to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling frustrated and sad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: With not being able to function better? Do more stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: (pause from  to  I wish I were a lot less, (pause) together. Or a lot more together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">(pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Seems a way to put it, I guess what I have in mind is, you know, because like having it together, which I assume is getting to be like, you know practical things, and directed and stuff like that. I guess, I wasn't shocked by you saying that. But that's in a way just like, in a kind of a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">literal way your mind is not together. In that you can't really remember stuff, you can't find words easily, it can be hard to describe what you are feeling sometimes. These things are very separated, not together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">(pause from  to ) My point being, I imagine you are referring to that too, when you say you wish you were more together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. (pause from  to ) Yeah. (pause from  to )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: I think, first let me close the shade, I think it's, very disturbing to be so not together in this way. I mean both in terms of like, in terms of your life but also in terms of memories are over here, your words over there and your feelings are over there, they are not really, well connected, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">like the search board is not reading well. I think it's probably much more so to feel like that's being done to you by the ECT.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098858\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: It's not fun. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: And I think, I do think it probably recapitulates and experience you had, an experience you've had over and over in your life, which is began like, you know, you are getting the message, sometimes explicitly, and sometimes by well-intended people, inadvertently that what you feel is not okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">It can't be handled and has to be pushed away, it has to be packaged, it has to be hospitalized, it has to be split apart, it has to be kept under wraps or under control. It can't be part of conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's about right. . (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Obviously, I'm not intending to say that ECT is inherently bad or the people doing it are malintented.
