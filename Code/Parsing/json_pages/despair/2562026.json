Which sucks. And also, yesterday I just had this horrible blinding headache, and I left work early because I was just like, I can\u2019t do anything. Also I was like, my head hurt, and I was feeling really snappish <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">because my head hurt, and Dr. [inaudible] called me yesterday, and you know, bad headaches, headaches are one of the potential side effects which... I\u2019m feeling very pessimistic about everything right now, I guess, is kind of the answer. Yeah. Which is not fun. Part of that is, along with regularly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">feeling really weepy, which has stopped, which is nice, I\u2019d also been, apparently, feeling, just, like, really scared. I\u2019m sitting at my desk doing, I don\u2019t know, e-mail, and then I have that, like, fight or flight, but the flight part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which also I really don\u2019t like, because then it\u2019s upsetting and then I can\u2019t really do much other than kind of try not to feel scared, and wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Does it differ from times you\u2019ve felt panic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s more like... partly I just feel frustrated because it feels to me more like times that I feel like are PTSD related. It\u2019s like, that kind of scared feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I see. Like [inaudible]\u2019s around the corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And additionally, she\u2019s now taking the bus from the bus stop next to me, so that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yikes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: You only, I mean, it\u2019s a terrible petty thing, but she really looks terrible, and that makes me feel good. Which, you know, it\u2019s weird to think that the two times, no three times I\u2019ve seen her around my bus stop, and I think now, I\u2019m sure that she\u2019s taking, like, one of the stops is her way <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">home, which is one of the stops on my way home sometimes. I don\u2019t really feel scared seeing her, but when I\u2019m randomly feeling scared, it\u2019s like the feeling I used to have when I saw her. So that\u2019s also really, like, I don\u2019t... It\u2019s hard to know what to do to feel better because I don\u2019t really I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">know why I\u2019m feeling scared, so... I just don\u2019t know what to do half the time. I had made myself a couple of years ago, a weighted blanket. And then my cat puked on it and yeah. So getting the little plastic pellets to weight it is a pain because they\u2019re heavy, and either you pay a lot for shipping <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">or you\u2019re hauling them around on your back, and it\u2019s not really, blah. [inaudible] plunked down like $50 to get them, then came home and made half a blanket, and then got really frustrated and upset about the math not working out, of how to make it. On the other hand, I was also waking up during the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">night, like, I always wake up a little bit when my cat, it\u2019s like, 3 am, he\u2019s like \u201cHELLO! I\u2019m a cat!\u201d but usually I can just like, pet her, or give her water or whatever, and fall back asleep. But I was having just, like, \u201cI\u2019m awake now!\u201d or just not feeling sleepy at all. Taking Ambien and being like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200215\">\u201cDoo doo doo... can\u2019t sleep\u201d. Which then makes me really anxious, because I want to get to sleep. Then I just sort of sit there and do that. So even half a weighted blanket was still nice. I successfully slept for two days. Two nights. Yeah, it\u2019s depressingly exciting. But also, it\u2019s exciting and frustrating <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200216\">and there is a sci-fi convention this weekend in Manchester where I know probably at least a dozen or so people that I\u2019m friends with are travelling to be there. So, got a hotel room, got a membership, whatever, whatever, but I did that all like, two months ago, and now I really don\u2019t know if I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200217\">to go, because, like any convention, it\u2019s noisy, it\u2019s echo-y, people are crammed in, just on you because A) there\u2019s not enough room, and also there will be a lot of people I don\u2019t like. Like, conceptually don\u2019t like, not individually don\u2019t like.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562026\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Sorry, what is that distinction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Oh, it\u2019s like not like, I\u2019m thinking I hate these ten people, it\u2019s more, I hate really sexist gamer guys. There will be 200 of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I\u2019m not... I mean the answer is I don\u2019t know. I kind of want to go anyway. I\u2019m splitting a hotel room with a friend so it\u2019s not as expensive, so I can go into the hotel room to get away from people, but I\u2019m also like, why am I spending money to be annoyed? It\u2019s hard, because all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">the socializing basically takes place near the hotel, which is the waterfront, which is this like, it\u2019s really annoying to get to with all the transit. It involves, at some point, walking over a bridge. There\u2019s the highway and you\u2019re on a bridge and it\u2019s just crap. Yeah. Don\u2019t like it. So it\u2019s by the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">waterfront. It\u2019s not easy to get back and forth. So I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m just worried about all of that and feeling really irritable and angry and<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: And pessimistic and down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: And sometimes really scared, and yesterday was a splitting headache.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly. I don\u2019t know. And I feel like I don\u2019t have any way of knowing how I\u2019m going to be feeling, except probably kind of cruddy. But seeing people not seeing everyone in town would make me feel super neurotic, and I\u2019d feel like I was being left out [chuckles]. See the other problem? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">Not going will make me feel depressed and no one likes me all weekend, but going isn\u2019t great either, and I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">[PAUSE 10:47 10:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: The friend of mine that I\u2019m sharing the hotel room with is, her name is Jen. She\u2019s very nice. She lives near my parents, kind of randomly. I knew her for two years, and it somehow transpired that I\u2019m like, \u201cWait a minute...\u201d and my parents had seen her and her husband, because she is a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">petite Asian American woman and he\u2019s a very tall white guy, so they\u2019re... and they had a new baby that they were always walking around in the stroller.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: When you say right near your parents, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I mean a ten-minute walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: within easy walking distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes, and the house that they own, I\u2019m pretty sure that someone I know used to live there, like brother\u2019s friends or something. Yeah, it\u2019s really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: That is really funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s ludicrous. Yeah. that\u2019s definitely the closest that I\u2019ve had someone be like, \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Down the street. But she\u2019s kind of closed off from her feelings, so she\u2019s not someone that I could really, if I was feeling really freaked out, she\u2019s not the person that I would be like, \u201cHey\u201d. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">She also really doesn\u2019t like being touched. Without asking, or even with asking. When she was pregnant, she didn\u2019t want anyone to touch her stomach. There were some times when I was like... and I had to pull my hand back because we know each other well enough that I thought I was in tummy-touching territory, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">but no. So I\u2019m a little concerned about sharing a bed, even though it\u2019s a King.

Good job\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s a little...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, it\u2019s not... She\u2019s not the ideal person for you for this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been thinking about it. There\u2019s a way in which she kind of is, that she\u2019ll give me all the emotional privacy I want. Which can be nice, so that\u2019s good, but the other part where she can\u2019t really provide emotional support is not ideal. And the other, the other big pessimism has been school, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">and finishing, or trying to finish. It\u2019s typically bad timing, but I\u2019m having this moment of \u201cWhy am I bothering doing this degree? No one will listen to my opinions, there\u2019s unemployment in the field... blah blah blah\u201d. I\u2019ve wasted my time. Which I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t solidly believe. I think if <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">I talked to myself in four months, I\u2019d be like, \u201cIt was a good choice\u201d. But right now, I\u2019m just blah. Especially since I\u2019ve had such a series of annoying, frustrating work interactions that were basically, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not a librarian, so we don\u2019t care what you think, because you\u2019re not a librarian\u201d. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200653\">Including today, which was a staff meeting where someone had come to talk to all of us, but what she meant was, \u201cI want to talk to librarians\u201d. Which was everyone except me. Maybe one other person, but basically everyone else. And I was trying to not say anything during the meeting, which is always <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200654\">difficult for me, partially because I\u2019m just like, \u201cYou don\u2019t...

One, I didn\u2019t want to say anything because she did not actually ask for my input. And the other thing was that I didn\u2019t want to get really annoyed and rip off someone\u2019s head, which is how I felt Friday afternoon. Maybe that\u2019s one of the reasons that I left, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">afraid this is not going to go well for anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You said you saw Dr. Cobb yesterday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And she wants you to keep trying this medicine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: We\u2019re meeting Thursday for a longer discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: So far it\u2019s not going so well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Like, I wasn\u2019t angry at her but she felt that I was more petulant, which I was like, hm, it\u2019s hard to say. She\u2019s trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">to do a January clean out the whole apartment re-do your life home thing, which is just not really working with my mood. So there\u2019s also that. Which I think is where a lot of the petulance that she feels is from. But yeah, like last week I was, someone had not told me about a system I had to install <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200873\">so I had to like, last minute rush and then two thirds of the way through, someone was like \u201cActually you don\u2019t have to do half of that, but you know, we\u2019d need it eventually so I guess it\u2019s not a waste of your time\u201d. I\u2019m like, yeah, fuck you. And then, he\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, I have to go get lunch\u201d and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200874\">I\u2019m stuck there, no lunch, he\u2019s not going to get me anything, and I\u2019m upgrading all the software for him. And I was super angry about it, like, definitely more angry than irritated. The next day, too, another librarian was like \u201cHey, can you do this thing. It\u2019s Thursday at four, can you upgrade all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200875\">the software by Tuesday at two\u201d. And I was pissed about that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah I guess it\u2019s something that seems to be coming up a lot, pointlessness, thanklessness, whether it\u2019s that work stuff you were just talking about, the convention this weekend which is supposed to be fun, and part of your worry is that it\u2019s just not going to be, or that there\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">be maybe too much in the way of that, or the medicine that\u2019s supposed to make you feel better, or the degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I already got super annoyed at someone that I like. [inaudible] to do something. Nope, can\u2019t do it. Here\u2019s my suggestion, and she\u2019s like, \u201cNope, that\u2019s a stupid suggestion\u201d. Blah blah blah. And I was just pissed. Even though she didn\u2019t actually say it was a stupid suggestion, but you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">know. I just was really mad at her. I think the other thing which is I feel like the more competent I am at work, the more insanely demanding people are, because I tell everyone I want a week\u2019s notice for installing whatever. But they also all know from it happening, that if they\u2019re really last minute <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">and forget, I can usually make something happen. So this staff meeting today, someone was talking about how ideally, you shouldn\u2019t even, like, ideally the librarian helping you with your research or doing whatever is kind of invisible. They\u2019re helping you learn how to help yourself, and so you end up <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D3\">being like \u201cOh yes I have mysterious extra knowledge! So strange!\u201d, and they\u2019re creating guides for you and all this other stuff, and it really means that, you know, people don\u2019t appreciate or realize how much work we do. And I really had to stifle down this, \u201cYeah. Now maybe you appreciate what I do <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D4\">for you, and half the time when I do it you criticize me anyway, so meh.\u201d I did. Because I was fairly sure that was a bad idea. A couple, I don\u2019t know, I managed to score a meeting with someone from Disability Services about specifically my library, which I was totally excited about.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562026\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Sorry, about what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: About accessibility, and also marking the bathrooms. And it was this really depressing conversation where the disability coordinator was like, \u201cYou need to stop thinking of solutions\u201d. She\u2019s like \u201cYou just need to identify the problem and not try to think about ways to fix it\u201d. I don\u2019t understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">why I would do that, and her, she didn\u2019t really explain that, but whatever. I guess all she wanted me to tell her was just the facts. And it had to be affecting a current patron, otherwise it wasn\u2019t a problem. Her comment was, \u201cWell, if we fix an accessibility problem in the bathroom, if we even look <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">at it, then the whole building has to be addressed. Like at this point the whole building has to be brought up to code and that\u2019s not possible.\u201d That doesn\u2019t seem to make sense at all, and I don\u2019t know, I just... it was just a very, it was very depressing to have her be like \u201cYeah, we\u2019re not going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200933\">do that, we\u2019re not going to do that. Yeah, we don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d and also I felt very condescended towards. I was the person who contacted her [inaudible] dah dah dah. Then she comes and is like \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re interested in accessibility, but you have to understand that some of these are <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200934\">just guidelines, not the law. And you know, if it\u2019s not required by law...\u201d I\u2019m like, oh my God. I know that, but I don\u2019t think that a lawsuit should be our guiding principle. At sort of the end of the meeting, other people got action items, and I got none. Which was, I don\u2019t know, just like... I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200935\">that was vaguely insulting and frustrating, because... the end game I want is better accessibility. The way they\u2019re going to do that, she mostly shot down, and wasn\u2019t actually interested in anything I had. She went and talked to the two other people at the meeting. Not me. And it just really sucks, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200936\">especially as I set it as an achievable work goal, and now I have to re-do that, because... I can\u2019t achieve it because I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">[PAUSE 00:29:29 to 00:30:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: I think part of the other thing is that so, everyone\u2019s understaffed, and people often talk about \u201cOh, yeah, they\u2019re having free time, I would do X, Y, and Z\u201d. I am actually not busy every hour of the day. Not at all. But I feel incapable of getting work to do that. I would like to do more work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">I would like to do more things for the library or more things for my department, but I keep on getting told no, or there\u2019s forty bazillion barriers up, and I feel really guilty and crappy that other people are feeling huge pressure, time pressure, and I\u2019m not, but I\u2019m also like, well, I don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200972\">I can do to change that. And I do try to volunteer to help people with things, if someone sounds like they\u2019re really stressed, but in the end, I don\u2019t know. My little Cambridge brain, or big Harvard brain, and various computer skills are just not doing anything. Running software updates, and that\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562026\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">[ PAUSE 00:31:58 to 00:32:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: I think that also right now I\u2019m definitely feeling like I\u2019m super uninterested. There might have been a time to tell people but right now I\u2019m just like \u201ceh\u201d. Don\u2019t feel like it. Why should I take on an extra, why should I help someone out with their task or take on an extra duty or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of hard as you are talking, from feeling down, irritated, pessimistic, at the beginning of the hour to now really seeming much more shut down, I think. I\u2019m not saying that those are wildly different, but there seems to be a progression isn\u2019t quite the right word, but movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I feel like, I do feel shut down on, like, kind of doing anything, or like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like the people you\u2019re talking about are more impossible or implacable, if things were a little more workable... it\u2019s like you\u2019re just sort of affecting different... it\u2019s not like it was real [inaudible] but it seems like, lower and flatter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, the more I think about or talk about it, I\u2019m kind of the... not the worst that I feel, really, but I feel more distant. Like emotionally distant, I feel from...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I wonder if, just talking about it is making you feel more helpless about all of it, and more overwhelmed, and also that I haven\u2019t done or said anything to make it feel more workable or more manageable. I\u2019m not saying you imagined I was going to have ten strategies for you, but more like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">sort of somewhere maybe there was a wish or something that I or somebody could help you to snap out of it, or say something to make it seem less overwhelming or smaller or...What about this or what about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, because right now it\u2019s like I definitely have times where I know I\u2019d really really like her suggestion so that I can X Y and Z. And right now I feel like, no, I don\u2019t. Actually I guess I feel like there\u2019s just nothing I can do. At one point a couple of months ago I thought \u201cMaybe for two <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">hours a day, or every Thursday or whatever, I\u2019ll concentrate on reading librarian blogs or updating Wikipedia to kind of keep my skills up. And now I\u2019m just like, \u201cWhatever, who cares\u201d. Like, you know, I feel like regardless, I have existing skills which are being ignored, so gaining more skills to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB2\">be ignored, why should I do that? And as far as Wikipedia goes, I actually am not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Is this writing entries, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Editing entries and like, copyediting, and like fixing the entries. Or joining, becoming someone interested in the Wikipedia community and joining it. Because actually I\u2019m not that interested in Wiki, so I think they\u2019re kind of like, \u201cWhatever\u201d. They\u2019re definitely a library buzzword, which, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">sure. It\u2019s a skill that some people think is relevant, and I\u2019m just not interested in doing that for I guess resume purposes or for the purpose of saying, \u201cOh yeah. I edited a hundred Wikipedia articles\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling beat down by all of this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I think beat down is too much. It\u2019s too emotional, in a way. I guess I feel kind of, like, stuck and hopeless. Like it\u2019s just not ... And unable to, sometimes I can convince myself that I\u2019ll feel better when it\u2019s not winter, which is usually true. But that doesn\u2019t feel like a possibility right <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">now. I don\u2019t really see, I just don\u2019t see anything improving. Yeah, like... I feel like if I do something or didn\u2019t do something, either way, nothing would... it\u2019s just not going to get better. It\u2019s going to suck. One of my friends had suggested that I start doing therapy twice a week again, and my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B72\">thought was, that\u2019s just going to depress me more. Because I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in the moment of figuring things out, or coming to terms with something. I just feel like another day of talking about how I feel depressed and hopeless and pessimistic sounds really crappy. I don\u2019t want to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562026\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: A way that it might help is, probably it\u2019s a little more contained, you leave it here a little bit.
