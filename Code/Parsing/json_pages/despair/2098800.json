I didn't tell them that I could be off on Monday next week so I probably should...so would Monday probably be a better day period? I'm just wondering whether I should tell them that my schedule is permanently changing or just tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">them I can't work Monday next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I would just do next week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay, that works.

The district manager is too mean to her. It's disappointing because she's very good at her job and I like her a lot. The next person coming in, I haven't met him yet, but he's an external hire which never really bodes well. He doesn't have caf\u00e9 experience. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">has certain retail experience. (pause) So we'll see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I had a hard time not hurting myself last night but I did not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I've been thinking about my father a lot. I've been thinking about church a lot and those are kind of separate and kind of not separate. I don't really know how to Papa (ph) right now. I talked to him on (inaudible) briefly. I called Mom and talked for a while and then called the house and tried <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">the house number and then Papa's (ph) number and then my other (inaudible). We talked and she told me all her funny stories. I missed them so much and I was so sad last week going home and then she told me about the day and I was like, \"Wow, I would have been a wreck!\" (chuckle) So it was good that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">I didn't go home but it was really sad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Sounds like it would (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Joanne really doesn't like anybody cooking in her kitchen. She thinks of it as her kitchen but Papa [wouldn't let Joanne near it] (ph) and said, \"No this is our kitchen.\" And to Papa that means his kids get to cook in the kitchen. And also Joanne...if nobody else were to cook, Joanne would feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">very put upon because she'd feel like nobody was helping her. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) she got going there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's a minor thing but it sounds like it was a little bit...the tensions were very present. When she's (ph) cooking, she doesn't really clean up after herself and it's just chaos, complete chaos and you have to just be okay with that. And if you are okay with that it will be fun and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">usually end up with something really delicious even if it doesn't look anything like what she set out to make. But it sounds like (pause) I would have been in the middle of that and now there's been a mess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">But I just...I don't know. I don't have (inaudible). (pause) The last time I was in the hospital we talked a little bit about some of the stuff that happened when I was a kid. I said, \"You know, it's okay.\" And I'm not sure that it is actually okay but I don't quite know how to take that back. It doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">seem fair. (pause) I had a really hard time (pause)...so I'm trying to get more involved at church and trying to make that a community that I can be a part of. But I had no idea what parishioners do. I know what priests do. I don't know what parishioners do. I don't know what my job is. (pause) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">I don't feel (pause)...I don't feel like I'm allowed to (pause) ask for anything (ph) or be there in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098800\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I (sigh)... (inaudible) came and visited me in the hospital, that's one of the priests in my church. And he's kind of the person that if I were in the clergy, I would want to be like him. I really profoundly admire him and so that was a shit show obviously (chuckle) in that I really profoundly admire <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">him so anytime he's nice to me I feel like I'm a horrible person. That is actually (inaudible) even though it doesn't sound like it ought to be. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">So he asked me if there was anything he could do and at first I said, \"No, I don't think so.\" (inaudible) you showed up. And then after a little bit I said, \"Actually, okay. I have a really hard time asking for help and I have a really, really hard time asking for help from priests, clergy, like asking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">for spiritual help. So if you could check in on me every once in a while that would be really good.\" (pause) And now I feel really guilty about saying that, like that's a huge thing to ask of somebody. That's a huge thing to ask of somebody whose job it is to do these things. (pause) And I'm not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">clear how this is my father's fault but it sort of feels like it is. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">(silence from 00:08:04 to 00:08:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: That's what was making me think of a the (inaudible) when you said at the beginning today when you had a hard time not cutting yourself yesterday that you had said last week that you wanted more help with the (pause)...with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Did I say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: That this was something that you [had to go to the] (ph) hospital, that is hard for you to talk about when you (pause) cut yourself but that this is (inaudible) bringing to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: (inaudible) Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: The little instinct in you forgot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah, doesn't surprise me. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) ask for help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: So I did (pause)...I have a friend who...I told you about Cody and Kerry (ph) (inaudible). So Cody is really into Magic so I asked him to help me with Magic. (inaudible) slightly true (inaudible) from my arm. (pause) And whenever I want to cut I trace that. There's this passage in numbers where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">God (inaudible) yet again sent all these snakes to slaughter them and to poison them and then Moses and (inaudible) people and God says, \"Okay.\" So they make a bronze serpent and it's on a staph and when he lifts up the serpent and the people look at the serpent and they're healed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Having been bitten?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yes. And that's taken often to be one of ten thousand prefigurations (ph) for Christ in theology because that's what people do. They're like, \"Okay, we don't know what to do with this? It's probably about Christ.\" (laughter) And then there's a later passage, I forget where, I think in one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">the Samuel chronicles where they (pause) cleansing the temple of all the (inaudible) and the serpent is still there so they get rid of it because this is this other god that they're worshipping. So the theory is that this test in numbers is some way of reconciling different ways of worship. But for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">me it's healing through transformation, which I think I mentioned last week. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098800\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">But also I was just reading that the snake is a symbol of healing through transformation because the (pause) theory was that snakes were immortal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Immortal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah so in Gilgamesh it's a story of Gilgamesh is taking immortality and he finally gets the herbs that would allow him to be immortal and then he goes to swim in a pool and a snake comes up and eats him and runs off. And as he gets out he sheds his skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: So the idea for me that (pause)...I was thinking, the thinking about it when I want to cut myself isn't very effective. Exerting my will is not very effective. So the idea is to find something that I don't have to do anything other than look at it. It works okay. (pause) Cutting myself is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">basically Magic anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: What's the idea about how (pause) that incident in Numbers prefigures Christ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Oh, I don't quite remember. (chuckle) I don't know, something about...yeah I don't know. That's not very important to me because I don't think any of it (inaudible) when people say prefigures Christ actually prefigures Christ. I like to look into it and see what they are. (pause) But two-thirds <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">of theology is kind of closed book to me. (chuckle) Sorry, it's just kind of iffy in my theology anyway. I don't know. I'm not Christian because I believe in Jesus. That's probably the biggest thing that's gotten in the way of me going to church in the past. (pause) Because I just don't know what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">(silence from 00:15:05 to 00:15:26)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">Cody is really excited that (inaudible). I was kind of nervous about asking him but he was very willing to do it. He talked about...I sent him a page on non-suicidal self-injury and he said, \"Reading this I realize this is something I used to do when I was younger.\" He used to get...he did and I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">to some extent still does have real problems with anger and so he said in terms of things like punching a wall with the intent to injure yourself or getting in fights with the intention of being hurt. He said it was something he did a lot. So that was a good thing too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(pause) And it is very often about anger for me. I don't know, I just get so angry and I don't know what to do when I'm angry. (pause) It's not like I can tell somebody about it. (chuckle) (pause) Yesterday I was just upset with myself by the end of the day because I worked all day and then had like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">two hours of not working and then had to go to church and (inaudible) minister so I had to get there early. And it's like messed up a lot, being in church, I think I was just tired. And a lot of things that probably to an external person would seem like nothing but to me it was like, \"Well I did this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">thing that wasn't exactly the way I wanted to do things.\" And so it was a disaster! Yeah, same (inaudible) and it's just tiring. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">And they forgot that I was supposed to go home at 2:00 so at 12:08...I kind of set my, \"I need to make it till 2:00. I need to make it till 2:00. I need to make it till 2:00.\" And then five after 2:00 I was still (inaudible). I was like if I don't leave I'm going to start crying in front of everybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">and that's going to be horrible. So I had to say, \"Guys, I need to get out of here. Somebody else needs to get on register because I have to leave,\" which I did so that was good. They were very nice about it. I really like the people I work with.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098800\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">I really like them so they were like, \"What was wrong?\" and I want to tell them but I know from experience that that's a really bad idea, or it at least could potentially be a really bad idea.

(chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: (laughter) Apparently!

(pause) I was thinking of that, getting it tattooed, and Cody said, \"Don't do that, at least not right now,\" because he said it was a bad idea, if there was any, anything in my mind that believed that it would not work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: It'd be better to get the tattoo if only 90 percent of you believes it would work and ten percent doesn't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">(silence from 00:24:33 to 00:25:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I guess I imagine that (pause) our relationship ends when specifically I think (ph)?

I don't know very many people who think about God in anything like the way I do, (pause) which means getting more involved in church and talking to people about beliefs <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">and religion is kind of a double edged sword. On the one hand it sometimes brings me closer to people and sometimes it just pushes me farther away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What's so different about your belief? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I'm not really sure. (pause) I don't think it's terribly important that I'm the Christian. I think it's terribly important that I be something or that I be with other people and (pause) I take the Bible very, very seriously but that doesn't mean I believe everything it says. I mean, the worst <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">part is I have a hard time respecting people who say they believe everything it says because that means that they're probably just not reading it very carefully because it says a lot of things and a lot of them are contradictory. I don't know why, which is just silly. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">I'm starting to kind of wrap my head around some of the kind of larger, big, theological pieces of Christianity like the Trinity and the sacrament and things like that.

I do, in some things, but not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">all that many people, (pause) which means I tend to put, I guess, too much pressure on those people to be just like me because it's like, \"Oh, somebody who understands me who is like me.\" And then I worry because I just want to jump on that person and then I'm like, \"That's not good. I can't do that.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I see.

I guess I'm mostly worried because it sort of sounds to me like what I'm saying is I'm a very (inaudible) (chuckle) and I just don't have very much patience with that, in others or in myself. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I was thinking (ph) (chuckle) (inaudible) real differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: There's a real arrogance to saying I can't follow the same path to believe as other people.

(pause) I had a [colloquial moment] (ph) like, \"Oh good! Other people also find this problematic.\" I just don't buy it and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">think it's kind of dangerous in some ways. I just don't...there's no...it doesn't make sense to me that this one person should be the most important person ever. There's nothing that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It just doesn't resonate with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. There's nothing in the gospels that doesn't...that resonates with me more than other really good stories about really good people. The thing that is starting to make it work for me is the idea of God as suffering with humanity and that has really just come through my own suffering. I've <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">been suffering a lot for a long time and thinking about that a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Thinking about it (inaudible) as not being sort of separate or removed from human suffering? Like very much in touch with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah, that God doesn't tell us why we suffer. It just doesn't happen. But that God suffers with us and that that helps somehow and that makes the idea of Jesus as God and also human, that makes sense to me, or makes it like okay, I can see where this can go to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Like it's not exactly the same as a term in theology that is usually sort of understood but it's sort of related or [if you're feeling down] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah and this is the idea of God as suffering, it's certainly like people talk about it a lot. It's not like I made it up but that didn't make sense to me until I was in so much pain. It didn't make sense to me until recently. (pause) I feel like I've, in the past, gotten through the depression <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">by saying, \"Well it will get better someday,\" and I don't think I can say that anymore. (pause) Maybe it will but I have no (crying)...I have no evidence to make that make sense. So (pause) this is kind of the other way that I can deal with it.
