00:00:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I ran into Dr. Hoffsteder (sp?) yesterday. She said some very nice things about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I can't imagine why, but that's very (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: She seems very pleased about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible). She suggested I make some diet changes like not eat only pasta and bread. So I'm thinking about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause): [00:01:44 00:02:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I feel like, well, it's the next thing to try. So, I should try it. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(Pause): [00:02:25 00:02:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don't know. Except going on diets because I couldn't do it without shaming myself constantly. Like I don't know how to. I don't know how to say that what I eat is important without beating myself up in my head constantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(Pause): [00:02:59 00:03:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Then trying to talk to James about it didn't do very well at all. Basically, it devolved into him saying that nutritional science is an actual science, which I agree with. I absolutely agree with, but I'm kind of past the idea that science is really what I'm going for here. (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) It sounds like it's a (unclear) on your mental health list. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yep. (Laughs) That just wasn't the conversation I wanted to have. The conversation I did want to have which was we eat together all the time so this would be a big deal for you, too. Like, if that's something you wanted to do or support me in it or whatever and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: What is the situation? Like I'm just saying we never really talk about, I don't think, do you pretty much just eat bread and pasta, then? I don't know how -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) I eat like toast for breakfast pretty much every day. And then I usually don't eat lunch. And then we have like a big dinner, which is like it depends on the day of the week. I eat meat like three times a week, maybe. And a lot of starches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Fruits and vegetables?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Not that many of them. I work on them. Yeah. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: I'm really just asking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. But that's the thing. Like I can't talk about it without getting angry at myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: I see. Are you defensive? And is it how much is money a factor and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: So it's more of a factor because we basically only eat local food and we only buy from local stores so we shop, which is a hell of an expensive but like super good, you know, they have amazing, amazing food. But not cheap and like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Stuff that's downtown? Is there one around here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: It's the one like up how can I (unclear)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Somewhere in Andover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Somewhere in Andover. Yeah. We shop at the main store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Is there a food store in (unclear)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: There used to be one, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Oh, okay. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: It's an institution there, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, we go to the one that (unclear). Yeah, I read the website. I think the Andover location is like the first one, but it's pretty small.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559768\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I know there's one in Andover and then like we shop at like the co-op and the square and there's a little grocery store on (unclear). So we spend a lot of money on food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: So, I don't know how much, like I also don't quite know how much money we spend on food. So, it's like it's a factor, but it's not the biggest factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">(Pause): [00:07:39 00:07:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: A lot of it also is that like James does pretty much all of the shopping and probably more than half the cooking. For a long time he was doing all the cooking and I don't know. I feel like I that's something he started doing, basically because if it were up to me I just wouldn't eat, ever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">Like I wasn't, I couldn't do it. I definitely ate like frozen meals for a good year and a half, solid. Like that's all I ate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Before James moved here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I feel like bringing up my feeling guilty over him doing all of this and I can't I'm kind of loath to say like, okay, I need to change everything about how we eat or like he's been making sure that we eat for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I see. Also, what is (unclear) recommending you change your diet for -mental health reasons or for physical health reasons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: For mental health reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: She said that there's basically like two experimental routes that I could take. The first is to kind of move toward eating just like more whole foods, like a lot of meat, a lot of fish a lot of fruits and vegetables. Not a lot of flour basically, starch. Or I could she said that it's also <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">possible that I have a really sensitive (inaudible) that I could see what happens. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">(Pause): [00:10:16 00:10:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: You know, at this point I'm basically going with (Pause) blind trust to tell me so I do them.

I mean, in a way, everything like you're not doing well enough? I think, or I think that's maybe how you're hearing it? Or you're not doing that in the right way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's what it feels like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: And so that makes you feel terribly ashamed and then I think you want James to help taking care of yourself better and at least (unclear) what you're saying is he actually is getting very focused on another point and not that one really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: And then I think you also sort of talk with me about it wanting me to help you feel better about it like, 'that's a shame,' maybe more supportive of at least your attempts at what's bothering you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know what I want you to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">(Pause): [00:15:14 00:15:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: I really don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Well, I imagine you sort of are quite ambivalent and want me to take care of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559768\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">(Pause): [00:15:27 00:15:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, (Pause) that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">(Pause): [00:15:35 00:16:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Part of it seems to be that when someone does it in a way that feels helpful it makes you feel horrible for having wanted it.
