I don't want to take up too much time with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: But I wanted to just see if we could finalize, or if I could just get some like finalized hard information from you because I need to submit this financial aid thing like today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I needed to submit it like weeks ago but I think with the info that I got I should be able to reasonably produce the info that I need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions. And if it's helpful, this is just a printout of the, even if just to look at it for a moment. There are just a few things I wanted to just see if I can -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">And I realize that you're not the insurance company. You know what I mean? But I'll talk to them today too, but to the best of your ability. So you should be able to confirm then that it's a fifty dollar deductible annually. I asked them on the phone and I asked for a couple of times and she was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">\"Yeah.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">And I was like, \"You've got to understand. This was like a thousand dollars for me before.\" This seems like I'm not reading it right or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: But everything on there seems to suggest that to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Even if like, I know you said there was some change where you're doing the insurance now and you're not going to be or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Even with that stipulation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: So fifty dollar annual deductible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: That is. I don't know what to make of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I think it's just because it's a student plan and they can negotiate much better deals for, you know, people in their twenties. They're healthier. They don't use the benefit as much. So they can -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: I suppose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: I mean I imagine. I'm just (inaudible 00:02:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, I imagine that's exactly what it's about. Because you don't have a lot of sick people that are in a plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I guess just maybe this is my like cynical political and economic views. But it just seems like students don't have any other option. Do you know what I mean? If they made it a thousand dollars. It's not as if students would then be less likely to take it. Like they have to, by law, take this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">or they don't have health insurance. Do you know what I mean? And I guess that's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But see what the school can do is they can kind of shop around and, you know, they can then go to Ithaca, they can say, \"Hey listen, we've got these healthy people. Give us the best deal possible.\" And so, you know, they want to have the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it's sort of a rarity too that folks in my situation would be doing something like this. It's probably -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You guys don't get sick. You don't get -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Or even probably not a lot of people doing this type of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, yeah, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Well, okay, cool. We'll do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: That's probably the most likely use of it, actually. So fifty bucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: This is Let me just So first off, I starred the line that seems to be pertaining to what's going on here.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559923\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: So based upon that, and actually I haven't read it in a few days, but that says twenty percent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Co-insurance afterwards? So that means it's an 80\/20, as opposed to what I'm on now which is a 60\/40?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Now here's the thing is that Let me just see something here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: In the page beforehand there is a little clause that I read with the person on the phone. And she basically said -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That doesn't make any sense. I read that too. I don't know what that meant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: I guess basically what she was saying is that that means is, not unlike what you told me my insurance I have now did, was they said, you know, \"We'll do 60\/40 of a price that we determine to be appropriate, regardless of what you might bill.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: So what she referred to as \"the usual and customary.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Customary, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: She said it would be hard for her to give me like an estimate of what that might be. She said that if you had a, what was it called? Like some kind of a number. She said a CPT code or a procedure code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Do you have one of those?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You can tell them that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Because she said that if I can get that she can give me a pretty good estimate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. Oh, she should have known that. 90834 is the number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: 90834? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Oh maybe she did know that, it was a general She probably was just dealing with general. Yeah, 90834.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: Cool. Well she didn't even have that in front of her. She couldn't even find it. She was from the insurance. So I had to read it off to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Because I think the insurance has like thousands of different plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, probably. So, yeah, that will be like one of the only stipulations that will make it hard to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: That's right. It's not clear what they consider usual and customary. It's totally dependent on the insurance company?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: I mean I think they have to I don't know how they come up with that number exactly. I think it has to call within certain kind of parameters. But it's not clear who sets it. It's definitely not maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: (laughs) And so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: It sounds like my company now is doing something along those lines though, right? Like that was that shift that they made recently, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">CLIENT: And I guess if anything is promising too, that it's 80\/20, because then they would even be covering more of the amount. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Right. And so your copayment would go down a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It might be cut in half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Assuming the same rate. You know what I mean? Assuming that they're operating on the same usual and customary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">THERAPIST: That's right. That's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean? Well, which is why So basically -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And if I was doing one time a week we could assume that they would cover once a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Oh they will cover twice a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B5\">CLIENT: They will cover twice a week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B9\">CLIENT: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but PPOs of the insurance will cover twice a week. They cover multiple. You know, they'll cover four.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559923\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: So then for me try to budget this thing, I'll try to get a number from them today with this CPT code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: You know what, though. It's like Yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true. But the other thing I was thinking of is Yeah, try to get that and then we could figure it out. Because the other thing I was thinking of is that we could use, if it's much less than what it is now, we could use the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF1\">money from the recordings to apply it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: And that's the other thing. Is that I realize that even right now we're already, like in a way I sort of got grandfathered into the rate that I'm at now. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: So what I was wondering was if you would want me to get this information and then provide it to you and then you could let me know. Because I don't even really know how much, like per session, you are taking away from this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: Based upon what your average is. I realize you have been very accommodating. You know what I mean? And I recognize too that that was based upon this set of circumstances with my insurance now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: So I don't know if you want me to get this information and provide it to you and then you could reassess and then you could say that under those conditions, this is what it would be like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">CLIENT: This is what your copayment would be, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Well, one thing that I think of, just in terms of submitting this budget is, if you would feel comfortable doing this, that you just, and I'd agree with this, that I wouldn't charge you more than you're paying me now. And if it ends up being that they -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">CLIENT: Per appointment, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And that it will actually likely go down. If that is something you're comfortable with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">CLIENT: I'm totally comfortable with it. Then I'll budget thirty eight. I think it's thirty eight dollars an appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">CLIENT: Does that sound cool? But if not -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: Okay. Cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: If that works that's okay with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: Hey, that's fine with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: I just recognize that you've been very accommodating. I didn't want to not take that into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: That's nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">CLIENT: No, that's really cool. Then what I'm probably going to do then is I'm probably not even going to stay on my mother's insurance. Because if anything, even like the fifty dollar co-pay with this plan is probably going to be less per appointment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Probably less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">CLIENT: You know what I mean? So it makes no sense for me to stay on my mother's insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">THERAPIST: If you can get off of it now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">CLIENT: Because initially the reason I wanted to stay on it was because I thought that there was going to be another thousand dollar deductible. And I didn't want to have to have those both in the same year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">THERAPIST: No. That's a good one you got there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">CLIENT: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and the fifty dollars you spend now will go a long way. It will save you in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah, big time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Pretty quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">CLIENT: Well that's cool. Well than that will, I think that goes into effect like August 1st or something. So that will be something we can keep in conversation about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">THERAPIST: Gook. Okay. Cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">CLIENT: No, this is really cool. This is really comforting. This was something I was really worried about. Well, not worried about but I was just concerned about trying weave through all these details.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559923\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: That's an excellent That sounds like an excellent plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. I really don't know what to make I'm just waiting for the catch. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: I think, like I'm trying to remember, but I think the plan that I had in graduate school was similar to that. It was, you know, just very low cost for the student because they don't use medical. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. I guess I thought it would be a low cost if you're not using it. But then if you wanted to do something like this it would be very difficult. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">CLIENT: But, whatever. And I guess I just assumed that like employer based insurance I was getting with my Mom would be more competitive -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: than student insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">CLIENT: But, whatever. So that's good news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">CLIENT: Cool. So done with that. Yeah, I know we talked last week. We were having a conversation about smoking and thinking about that and so on and so forth. And leaving at the last point, but I wanted to keep talking about that. But this morning on the subway on the way here I got a message from Marcus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">CLIENT: Reese's (ph) fianc .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">THERAPIST: Fianc , yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">CLIENT: And it was weird. It just like it really kind of tyrannized my thoughts all morning leading up to this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">CLIENT: So I figured I'd like to talk about that. I mean he just sent me a very brief message saying like, \"Hey Geoffrey. Did you get my e-mail?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D\">CLIENT: And I saw it and I was just like, \"Oh.\" You know? \"No, I mean, I don't remember getting anything from you. You know, it's been a while since we talked and I didn't receive anything from you recently in e-mail.\" And so initially I just thought it was like, \"Oh, when I get service back I'll just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D1\">send him a message saying 'No, can you resend it?'\" But I was thinking about it and I think I did. I got an e-mail from him a while ago when we were having like an exchange. Right around the time when this thing happened with my Dad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20131\">CLIENT: And it was sort of like after he had e-mailed me and said, \"Oh, everything's cool. Like no worries.\" And then we kind of just started shooting around some small talk to kind of leave it on more -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20133\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20135\">CLIENT: just kind of cordial note. And we were just talking about like current events. He always asks me about politics and stuff because he knows I'm interested in it. And he sent me something back and I sent him something. And I'm pretty sure, I haven't looked, but I'm pretty sure he sent me something <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201351\">back and I just never got back to him. And I realized that that's probably what he was talking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:32) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20139\">CLIENT: A while ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Two months ago or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that he did send me an e-mail and I didn't get back to him. And, yeah, it was just odd because when I first read his message I was very candid (ph) in thought, just cavalier in my thoughts. But I was like, \"No, I didn't get anything from you. Can you send it again.\" Of course, I'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D1\">get back to you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2013C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559923\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">But, yeah, it just And then I felt really different about it when I realized that he did send me something and I didn't get back to him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">CLIENT: Partially because I think a lot of the times when I talk to my Dad or something about it, I think I phrase it as like, you know, \"I send Marcus messages all the time but I don't really hear back from him too much.\" And I don't know how to explain it but I started to think about it like (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201431\">I started to think about just a lot of different instances where people asking me to stay in touch with people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">Like my Mom asking me to call my grandparents a lot. My Dad telling me to, you know, give Reese (ph) and Marcus a call or stay in touch with them. And I get very indignant when people say stuff like that to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">CLIENT: I get very frustrated. Not necessarily because I am keeping in touch with them and they're being redundant, but because I feel bothered by them like putting that obligation upon me to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">CLIENT: Because I don't want to. I don't for some reason. I don't even really know why in the moment it's not something I want to do, but it's not something I want to do. And I just thought about it. I don't know, I guess I just had this long kind of like line of thought. And I was like, \"God,\" like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D1\">Reese (ph) must think that, you know Reese (ph) and Marcus, must almost like lump me into a category like with my Dad or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">CLIENT: Like when they were trying to get in touch with him and he wasn't getting back to them. You know, I was just imagining in my head them being, \"Oh man.\" You know, \"Joe and Geoffrey, they just have no interest in keeping in touch with us,\" or something. You know what I mean? I guess I started <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201511\">to like I started to worry that I was mimicking behavior that I'm very critical of my Dad for having.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">CLIENT: Not returning calls to my Mom. Not keeping in touch with her when she tries to keep in touch, when she tries to reach out to him. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">CLIENT: And in a way sort of like almost being shocked at seeing this parallel that I haven't really thought about before. You know, a lot of the times I When I think about the fact that I don't keep in touch with people, I think about it as like this thing that's being done to me or something almost. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel very lost sometimes for like an explanation as to why I feel like I shouldn't have to. But I feel very, I guess, confident in a way that I don't examine saying that I'm not going to do it. That it's unfair. It's just very self-evident to me, or something. But I never articulate <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D1\">it to my parents, to my Dad or to my Mom, I think because I tell myself it's going to hurt their feelings or something. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">CLIENT: But, yeah, I know. I guess I just started thinking about it this morning. I was like, \"God. I wonder if I am doing anything really different than what my Dad does when he doesn't, you know, keep in touch with people that care about him.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">CLIENT: And I see people get very hurt by that. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20167\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20169\">CLIENT: I guess I sort of stepped out of like just purely thinking about it as like a \"me the victim of this.\" And then thinking like, \"God, maybe that's not a good thing.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559923\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Not a good thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">CLIENT: Sort of. Yeah. You know I kind of felt, because when I realized that I probably did get a message from Marcus, I didn't go back and resend him a new message and be like, \"Oh, Marcus, you're right. I think I realized that you did.\" I will continue to say that I just forgot about it or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201711\">or I didn't see it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">THERAPIST: Oh. Okay. Okay. What, because that (inaudible 00:20:45)? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's just, I don't know. I just wondered if I guess I just started to second guess that impulse that I have. You know what I mean? I started to just like step outside of myself and look at it from a different perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">CLIENT: And thought, \"God, maybe this is just a really shitty thing that I do.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">CLIENT: You know?

Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: Like he might of felt kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">THERAPIST: blown off in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah. And maybe he would be justified in saying that that's a really shitty thing that I do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018D\">CLIENT: That that's a Yeah. I don't know. And I guess it just called into question in my mind like, what is it that? Why do I get so indignant? It's like this happened the other night with my Mom when my grandmother just had a pretty big surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20191\">CLIENT: On her back. And my grandparents they are getting very old. So they're just starting to have a lot of things. Their bodies are just getting old so they're having a lot of these health problems which are just like thematic (ph) of old age. They've been going in and out of the hospital left and right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20193\">And my Mom has been very involved with them because it's her parents, as I probably would be. But I've really been very distant from the whole thing. And my Grandma came home from the hospital the other day. And my Mom, you know, she does what she does a lot of the time, and she said, \"Will you call <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201931\">your grandparents?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20195\">You know, she'll say, \"Will you do that for me? Can I count on you to call your grandparents every single week?\" Which I don't do and which she's asked me to do in the past. Which I've said I would do and then I didn't do. You know, I got really bothered by it on Friday night because she was just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201951\">\"Your grandparents, they'd love to hear from you. They always want to know what you're up to. They're always asking about you. It would make them so happy to hear from you.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20197\">You know? And then she finished it off with this little line like, \"And I know sometimes it's hard to get in touch with you.\" And she was like, \"Yeah, and I know sometimes it's hard to get in touch with you.\" You know? And I was like, \"No, I don't know, Mom.\" And at the time I really took issue with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201971\">the fact. Like it's not hard to get in touch with me because they don't call me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20199\">THERAPIST: Oh they don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B\">CLIENT: Maybe we don't talk a lot, but it's not because I'm hard to get in touch with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A3\">CLIENT: But I remember that's what I took away from it and that's what I was I was like I felt very slighted by that comment.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559923\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: And it was something I could say, \"That's not true. You're wrong,\" or something. But I think it's probably just like irrelevant. You know? The point is I don't call my grandparents ever. And it drives me crazy when my mother tells me to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: It's like it really, really makes me want to like throw my phone on the ground and break it.

I suppose on some level that it's a I suspect on some level there is a frustration with the fact that maybe my Mom is picking up on something that, maybe it's bringing to the fore some layer of guilt that I feel about the fact that I don't call my grandparents more. So maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF1\">that's frustrating because I can't do anything with that. Do you know what I mean? I can't challenge that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">CLIENT: But it's like, yeah, sure. Objectively, I should call my grandparents more. You know? I should eat more vegetables and I should, you know, get eight hours of sleep every night. Like, yeah, sure, on some level we could say that. Do you know what I mean? I should floss my teeth more. Do you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B31\">what I mean? But yeah, of course, on some level, it's not objectionable it's just obvious. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">But there's just something about like that moment. (pause) I just feel like something is so like backwards in that moment. Like I don't like calling my grandparents because it's not, I never feel good. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: I never feel It doesn't make me It's something that's very unpleasant for me to do. I feel like I'm (pause) The idea of calling my grandparents every single week would mean like placing front and center in my lists of concerns my attachment with my family. Like that's something (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B91\">I want to get away from. Do you know what I mean? Like those are like shackles I want to like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: break off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT: As opposed to getting tighter or something. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">THERAPIST: What do you notice when you talk? What's it like talking with your grandparents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">CLIENT: I mean all I ever feel like I'm doing is sucking a little less at being like a grandson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Mm. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT: Like my two cousins in New Hampshire grew up with my grandparents. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">CLIENT: So they were like, you know on all levels, they were like the model family.

Call them a lot even though they don't live near them anymore. And on some level it's just frustrating because I feel like all I'm ever doing is being a little less far away from <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201D51\">that standard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">CLIENT: Which just makes me feel bad.

Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Because you're not as close to them? You're not as -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Because I just feel like I'm doing this thing that.

And I know that part of the reason I hate going up to New Hampshire is because it's just Like we go up there and we sit down at a table and we eat. Because when we go up there everyone wants to celebrate it. So it's my Grandma, my Grandpa at a table, and my Aunt Kim and my Uncle John <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202011\">at a table, and then me and my Mom. And it just seems to just magnify my Mom being, you know, not that My Mom seems so happy up there but she seems also so out of place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">THERAPIST: Oh really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: So you sense that she feels like an outsider? Like she doesn't belong?

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20245\">CLIENT: Like I feel like for me and my Mom the most that we're going to able to do is like get a weekend of that. You know?

I mean, almost like one element of it I guess is that, yeah, you don't feel part, you know, you don't feel in the same mold as these others, as your cousins and these families that are up there. But also that, I wondered is there some sense that, you know, you guys are the divorced <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2024F1\">family. You guys are the one. So you go up there with this sense of like, \"It's not the same. It's different.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20251\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And it's great that we're up there. And it's great that we get to enjoy ourselves with that part of our family. You know, but I guess it's just sort of claustrophobic sometimes to be up there and have everything just be about family, family, family, family. And I guess I just sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202511\">(laughs) just feels like (pause) I don't know. I kind of feel like family kind of sucks too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20253\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20255\">CLIENT: That doesn't really seem to have any place for feeling.

(pause) I'm never going to feel like fulfilled no matter how close I am to my family up in New Hampshire.

You know? As benign (ph) as not writing a \"thank you\" note or something. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20295\">THERAPIST: Huh. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20297\">CLIENT: I don't know, it's like, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20299\">THERAPIST: Oh, do you feel like your efforts go unnoticed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029B\">CLIENT: Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029D\">THERAPIST: With regard to your Mom? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2029F\">CLIENT: Well that's the paradox of it, right? Because when I've spoken to you about it, which I really suspect is that part of the effort was for it to be unnoticed, right? Like that was the whole keeping it cool thing. You know? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A1\">THERAPIST: But while it was invisible, maybe there's some way in which you, there's some way of you being aware of the Well, not saying you wanted it to be visible but just because you didn't want it to be known didn't mean you also didn't want it to be known.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A3\">CLIENT: (laughs) That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A5\">THERAPIST: I think you'd like to just be acknowledged or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's right. That's what I mean. Yeah. But it's funny because there's something substantively different with respect to how much it bothers me when my mother tells me to call them as opposed to my naturally calling them. When I get to actually calling them it's okay, it's fine. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202A9\">THERAPIST: But certainly being asked -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AB\">CLIENT: That's the thing. That's it. And that's when it almost makes me not want to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AF\">CLIENT: You know? And I think on some level that that's even why going up there, it feels like swallowing my pride or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B3\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?

It's like, \"You don't have \" My parents, whether it's my Dad talking to me about keeping in touch with Reese (ph) or my Mom telling me to keep in touch with my grandparents. It's like, \"You're not in a place where you can speak as like an authority about how to be like the perfect <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202B71\">family member.

You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. And among the things in the, I think among the things in your Mom's kind of, \"Hey, call your grandparents,\" is in some way it feels like everything you already do is not acknowledged in some way. Like that's the implicit kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C9\">THERAPIST: One (ph) implicit kind of meaning of that to you that feels like really frustrating and infuriating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CB\">CLIENT: Because it makes me want to just throw that back at her. You know? \"I'm sorry my Mom that my weekend isn't going up and hanging out with my family and just making me think about my family.

It doesn't change You know, your awareness of the impact it has on them, as you say, like that kind of hits you, you know this morning, it doesn't change the feelings that you have about the meaning that it has when your Dad does or doesn't do something. Or getting in touch <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202D91\">with I guess you're also saying there's this other side to it that's outside of that that's equally true, or something.
