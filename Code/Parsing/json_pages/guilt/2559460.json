Things that, like, we would feel obligated to look after our parents. But then when I told him, you know, it's more psychological <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">in my sense because, while he might want to take care of his parents, he would feel, you know, guilty if he didn't. Or he wouldn't derive a sense of accomplishment based solely on that, from that help. Or that he wouldn't feel burdened by it. Like all of these emotions that I have attached.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">That's not cultural. (Laughter) And that's more psychological. But (pause) I just wonder, like, if I could unpack some of this. All this complicated stuff that's going on. I don't know where to start. (Laughter) I used to kind of like feeling fused (ph) to my mother, you know, but I suppose that can be unhealthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: You want to have a different identity of your own, you know, eventually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: It's very, I guess, painful to detach yourself from someone you feel so close to.

And they're in the mind. (Laughter) But yeah, I mean, (pause) I'm just trying to think that there are positives to be had in that scenario. But then there's also negatives, and sometimes the negatives can be very debilitating. So, you know, a good idea to distance yourself with them. When <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">I do that, I don't want to lose sight of some of the things that are important to me.

And bring positivity into the other person's life.

Should I ask her to tend to herself first?

But I also saw the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">negative side of that a lot. Like, their relationship was very, very strained. They hardly spoke. They lived together, you know, in one house, one apartment. There was hardly any dialogue. That was, like it was like a housing of mourning. You know, silence all the time. And yeah. And when he spoke <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A92\">to her, it was like in a very, very sharp, biting tone. And he screamed at her, you know. And she couldn't do anything. Like, she felt very, very restricted. And she couldn't step out. She couldn't meet people. She couldn't say anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">Like, once he bought this car, like he's well employed, so he has a little money and stuff. But he bought this Mercedes, you know. (Laughter) My boyfriend at the time, we were like, \"Oh, this is the best, you know, Mercedes ever.\" It (ph) was like (inaudible 31:38). And so, his friend came my uncle's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">friend came over. And my nanny, my grandma, she's so cute. She's so tiny. She's, like, five-ten or something. Not five-ten. Sorry. Four-ten. (Laughter) Four feet, you know. And she probably weighed, like, 75 pounds. And she's sitting there on the floor, and, you know, these two men are there. And she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB2\">like, \"I have to tell you something. Something very nice has come into our family.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">And my uncle is, you know, \"I told you not to tell them about-\" because he doesn't like to show off and stuff. Even though there's colleagues, he doesn't want his colleagues to know he's bought this fancy car. He never took it out. You know, it always would sit in the garage. He would drive his old <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">Nissan, whatever it was. (Laughter) A Maxima, everywhere, instead of this Benz. So my grandma is like, \"I have to tell you something nice has come into our family.\" My uncle's giving the (inaudible 32:51) my, you know, cousin (inaudible 32:57), you know, granddaughter just had a child.\" (Laughter) So <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD2\">she wasn't telling him about the car. It was, you know, my cousin had a child, who was coming at that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">So I just was like, you know, this is, you know, this is the extent to which he controls here. And it's so wrong, you know. Like, he's and then there were moments of, you know, very tender moments. Or not tender, but she had a pacemaker installer, and he'd be in her room with her, you know, and checking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">up on that. You know, being her son. But then there were other moments where, you know, like, she tried to clean up the bathroom one time and, oh my god, he screamed. He screamed and screamed at her for doing that work herself, instead of letting someone else do it. You know, this is (inaudible 33:55). <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">And she was in tears. You know, this is, like, an 80, 70-year-old woman you're screaming at, you know. I mean, I saw how powerless she felt, and I just didn't like that at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559460\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">So on the one hand, I appreciated that he was taking care of her. I also saw that his care made her completely dependent on him and completely powerless at his own hand. And he, you know, he is a terrible, bitter person and (sighs) too righteous, you know. Like, and yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Self-centered. Why would he think she was announcing that he got a car? Why would that be newsworthy? That's a strange thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What's the big I mean, clearly, he felt a very, you know, felt this way newsworthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: He did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the fact that he thought that she was going to announce the car, he must have felt it was very important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Who cares?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: [I don't know] (ph). But I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And it's interesting though. He saw himself as so powerful and so important, he couldn't imagine that other things might be more important than him or his car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Well, he just assumes that he is the center of her life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: And he probably was, to a great extent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: But it's interesting, the analogy. Because I'm not sure it's well, providing for your mother makes you feel important too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't want that. I want it, but I don't want it. Because it really does make me feel good about myself, being very honest. It makes me feel superior to a lot of other people who don't do it, you know. When I'm standing in a room full of my friends, I look at everyone and go, \"Oh, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">they don't do this. I do it. Yay, I win.\" (Laughter) I have a little victory dance in my head, you know. But then I'm like, now that I see the negative ramifications of it, I'm like, I don't want to do the victory dance. (Laughter) I don't yeah. I want her to be yeah, I want her to have her own <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD2\">marriage, and I don't want to take care of her. I don't want to be the center of her world, you know. I want to see her thinking about other things and ignoring me, you know. (Laughter) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Do you feel if you didn't pay her rent that she'd be resentful of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I feel that. Not just that, but she'd feel betrayed that, you know, you and I, we were one. What happened? You know, like, and then you don't care about your mother (inaudible 37:21) woman who has sacrificed so much for you. You know, the guilt. What do you call that thing (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Guilt trip?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Emotional blackmail that Nepalese parents [can do] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Do you think she knows that you left your old apartment to pay for her rent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: I don't know. I think she might be in denial, not wanting to know that.

If she knew that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don't want her to think that. Then she'll feel guilty, and I don't know where that would lead her (ph) to. You know, underneath (ph) she, you know. The way she lives drives me crazy sometimes. And if she was even more guilty and even more depressed then oh my god. (Laughter) I don't know if <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">I can deal with, you know, that. It's still about me entirely, you know. It's still very self-centered. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Do you feel badly about yourself and you think these things about her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: But I was thinking, and I anticipate this might cause you anxiety, so we'll talk about that. But I was thinking, well, guilt I mean, there's healthy guilt and unhealthy guilt. If you don't kill someone because you'll feel guilty for killing them, that's healthy guilt. (Laughter) I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E51\">you know, some guilt prevents you or has you do things that are the right thing to do, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: That's true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: It's not all bad. Taking something away from your daughter, you know, inhibiting her life. You know, a young woman who you want to see thrive so that you don't have to get a job, that might not be a bad reason to feel guilty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: What about my guilt? (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking that, right, so you can then say, \"Well, but then my guilt is healthy or normal.\" I knew you were going to say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: (Laughter) I can live with that, you know. Sending...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Sending your mother to the dungeon? (Laughter) You continue to be on this belief that she's a helpless, pathetic person. (Pause) I mean, if you do believe that about her, I guess, you know, I understand why you feel obligated to feel take care of, you know, kind of a retarded person. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">know, if you have, like, a retarded child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: And they can't take care of themselves, I think it would be cruel to, you know, just say, at 18, \"Well, good luck.\" But that's based on the fact that they're retarded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: I've worked at a school where they're treated. Or not treated. You know, where they go to school. So even that mentality has been kind of wiped out of my head, that they're pathetic, because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: They have capacities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: And to just be treated as enfeebled and incapable of anything is no good for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter) Well, I this happened in 2009. Like, I was going to MSU, and my mom when we moved to D.C., because I was going to MSU. And when she moved, she had come here and got in for a job at the daycare, and that went on for a few months. And then she hurt her back again, so she had <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF1\">to quit. Was let go or fired or something. And then she worked at a coffee shop, and that had such a deep psychological impact on me, I wrote about it and, like, I entered the story in a contest and it won and all that. But that just became kind of my mold (ph) of thinking (inaudible 42:27) for a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF2\">while. That, you know, that she had a dream of being a teacher, but instead of accomplishing, achieving that goal, realizing that dream, she, instead, was working at a coffee shop. Whereas, I was (pause), that semester, I was teaching my own course at MSU. And that made me feel very guilty.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559460\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: That's a very interesting story.

(Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: We do need to stop for today. You got my e-mail about the insurance, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Is it do you know what's going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It's not, you know it just is a weird I've worked with this insurance before, so I don't know what's going on there. They've just had a lot of problems. It's completely not your fault. You ought not to feel guilty about it. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: No, no, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Not your problem. But one thing they are doing is they seem to be sending checks to you, when it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Checks for you to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Exactly, that's what they're doing. I've had this happen before. So if they have the right address, it's not a big deal. Then you can sign it over to me. But I think they're being sent to your old address. So that's why, after all this (inaudible 43:38), that seemed to be the problem. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">if they're sent to you and it's your old address, it could take you a while. That's why I asked if you could and I'll try to have them send it to me. I don't know if that's going to work. So at the very least, if they send them to you and it's the right address, it would be more straightforward. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201112\">that's why I asked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Should I call them or ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah, if you can call and you may even just be able to update your address by calling them. So if you are able to call them and just update your address, I think this will solve a lot of the problem, because then they'll just send them to you. But I feel like they're sending them to you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">and you're not they have your old address. Okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible 44:12) you changed the address, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk 44:16) insurance. You call them and let them know.
