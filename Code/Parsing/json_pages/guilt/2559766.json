(Pause) Yeah, I feel a lot more, like, relaxed and rested at the end of the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:43)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (Laughter) I don't even know how to describe what we (laughter) (inaudible 00:52). Yeah. (Pause) That was scary though. (Pause) But it just, like, got really far out of my control really fast, and I wasn't really expecting it. I sort of just, you know, I've been thinking about it all weekend. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">(inaudible 01:36) I published this post about the ECT (ph) that I'm working on, which I think was really good. [You know] (ph), my friends have been really nice about it, which makes me feel kind of awkward and weird, but whatever. (Laughter) I feel that way whenever everybody says I wrote something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">well (ph). But yeah. I feel like I articulated what I wanted to say (inaudible 02:28). That was good. And for me, like, (pause) working through problems in writing is something and (ph), like, using writing as a way to talk about them is (pause) sort of feels like a big piece of myself that I'm getting back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Good. That's a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) You know, it was the sort of unintended effect but, like, now, like, people talk to me about it (inaudible 03:29) I'm over that. (Laughter) Which I'm not, actually. That's not really what I say, but yeah. It's sort of like I (ph) take two steps back to what I was thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">a week ago when I wrote it and, like, had (ph) the conversation (ph) from there. You know, and it's nice to feel like I can write again. Like, write well. (Pause) Yeah. I'm good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I'm worried about Jason. (Pause) I'll probably call him today, see how he's doing. See what I can do. Yeah. I feel like I don't know Jason very well. (Pause) We seem to just work (ph) really differently. He and Amanda are really close, and Amanda and I are really close. Jason and I aren't (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">really close. Yeah (inaudible 05:15) polite to each other, which is weird. (Pause) Jason and Gary and I Gary is Angela's (sp?) son. Angela was my dad's girlfriend for, like, [ten years] (ph). Gary was, I think, a year older than Jason, maybe two years older. Maybe, like, a year-and-a-half. So we ended <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">up playing together a lot, like, after Amanda went off to boarding school [before I did] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: (inaudible 06:04) when we were younger. It was, like, a little weird because, yeah, I was a lot older than they were at that age, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You're six years older than Jason?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I'm five years older than Jason. But sort of, like, well (ph), there was nobody else to play with. There was, like, really nobody else for me to play with. Gary and Jason were, like, best friends, which is good, you know, in the kind of (inaudible 06:37) sort of way. (inaudible 06:37) (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">It was interesting slash, I'm sure, tough for them because, like, Angela's style of child rearing was very different than my dad's. So I think I mean, I suspect one of the you could just really see how their relationship was, like my dad's and Angela's was, like, very close in some ways but they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">didn't really want to, like, meld (ph) their two lives. Or, like, Angela didn't want to meld (ph) her life with my dad's. It was very clearly, like, \"You raise your kids my way, and I'll raise my kids my way.\" Which was, I think, (inaudible 07:30) Gary was pretty spoiled. And it's hard for me to tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F3\">whether he was, like, actually spoiled or just, like, (inaudible 07:38) my dad. (Laughter) I always felt like he was actually -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559766\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: The thought crossed my mind (inaudible 07:45).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: (Laughter) Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I just don't know. I don't know. The last time I talked to Gary was, like, five years ago. He's a pretty great guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, he grew up well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Oh, [that's cool] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: He, like, decided not to go to college right after high school because he wanted to he was in a band. And so I think he's, yeah, doing (ph) a lot of music, and then did a bunch of community college classes and, like, got an associate's degree. In Texas Lakes (ph), there's a where the public <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">university is, if you, like, get a community college degree, you'll get automatic admission to one of the public universities, so he's going to UNC, which is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: It's good for Texas because, like, (inaudible 09:04) actually really good public universities. I think he'll do good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I worry about Jason. (Pause) [You know] (ph), it's really hard for me to let him do things his way and not feel like, \"No, living on a boat is a really terrible idea (laughter) for what you want to do after college.\" (Laughter) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, you would think out of three kids, like, one of us would be at all practical, but nope. (Laughter) Not at all. The guys are, like, with (inaudible 10:52). Like, somebody usually, like, takes the role of the pragmatic one, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 10:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Maybe. I would expect that anyway. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 11:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: [I sort of] (ph) (pause) feel like I don't know how, so I get anxious about, like, putting myself back in communities that I used to be part of. Like, how do I go back to a family vacation reunion, whatever, and be part of it? How do I be part of my church? (Pause) I finally e-mailed Kirsten, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">my roommate for the first couple of years I lived here. So I haven't talked to her in, like, at least six months. Basically, I sort of forgot she existed. We're sort of frenemies anyway. Like, it's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: It's [kind of] (ph) a fraught (ph) relationship, in some ways. Maybe more on my end than on hers. But if it's on my end, I'm sure it's on hers. In some ways, like, she's too much like me. She's like a version of the things in myself that I don't really want to be anymore or, like, that what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">she [seems to be] (ph). But, like, thinking about somebody as a version of yourself that you don't want to be anymore kind of dismisses (inaudible 13:30). (Laughter) It was always a struggle to, like, (pause) actually talk to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">She tends to be (pause) pretty needy, pretty sensitive. Not very good at confrontation. Not very good at saying what she needs. Again, like, a version of myself, like I don't know how well I'm actually like, this is the way I feel about her more than what she actually is. (Pause) So, like, sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">she would just (pause) really drive me insane, and sometimes she would be, like, a great, great friend. (Pause) It's sort of the same where, like, when I was the only person asking for things or, like, saying what I wanted, I think both of us sort of felt like I was being really pushy or, like, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">the spoiled one or something. But I also was like, \"No, it's not good (laughter) to not ask for what you want.\" (Laughter) Like, I don't I've been there. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559766\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: So I don't know. Anyway, I've kind of been, like, thinking about her. Like, \"Oh, that person still exists.\" I feel sort of bad about not contacting her (inaudible 15:22), then decided I wasn't going to feel bad about that. But so we (ph) the place we lived mailed me a check for, like, 15 dollars. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">It was, like, the one percent interest on our security deposit. So it was, like, 15 dollars that was, like, equally split between the two of us. So I finally e-mailed her and said, you know, \"I'm sorry that I haven't been in touch. It's really not you. I just dropped of the earth, you know, was depressed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">Let's go get a drink whenever you're done (inaudible 16:06).\" And so she hasn't e-mailed back, [and so that's] (ph) more or less the story, or end of the story. It's been, like, a week-and-a-half since (ph). And I really have no idea how to interpret that. Like, yeah. I don't know whether she's angry <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B3\">at me. I don't know whether she just didn't get the e-mail. I don't know whether she's been, you know, [first grading] (ph) (inaudible 16:41) TAing (ph) for, and then going on vacation. I don't know. As with James, I feel like (pause) like, start to feel guilty about not having been a good friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B4\">the last however long. And then, I just say, \"You know, I did the best I could,\" which wasn't very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 17:32)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It's much easier to let myself off the hook for (ph) past things and present things. You know, I can sort of see how (inaudible 18:44) this winter but, like, not going to Jason's not-graduation doesn't feel like doing the best I could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I feel like we should have made it work. (Pause) But, I mean, you were right. (inaudible 19:13) a good fix for that. It wasn't a good thing to do because, like, James really did not want to go. I didn't really realize how much he didn't want to go until (ph), like, the end of that conversation. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: The end of ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Of his and my conversation, like, right before I called you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: (inaudible 20:08) we're supposed to go visit some friends in Delaware, the week after next in, like, basically, the next town over. In Dover (ph), so [I don't know] (ph). I feel bad about that now (ph). We can go visit friends, but not family. Presumably, the car will be fixed, which makes things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">easier. (Laughter) Having a car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: I know (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: (inaudible 21:13), like, (laughter) I wonder how Chad is going to find a thread (ph) here.

(Pause) Which, actually, yeah, [when I come to think of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">it] (ph), there's other people in that category or people that I'm scared of. (Pause) Yeah, mostly (pause), you know, mostly I don't feel too bothered by it.

And her class, the class that she was teaching, had noticed that she was upset, and she sort of tried to, like, make a lesson out of it, and then she just told them she was just really overwhelmed by how unfair things were.

She's, I think, in a she's going to apply for a PhD program in the fall. But one of the big concerns for her is the remoteness of a lot of academic theology. So, like, the actual faithful.

I was writing about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">ECT (ph), and I (pause) it wasn't so much that I was trying to make sense of it as trying to explain the ways in which it didn't make sense.

But at the same time, (pause) I feel like if I spend too much time analyzing it before I say it, then I won't say what I mean anyway. Yeah.
