Did you watch any movie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">THERAPIST: [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">CLIENT: [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Not very many, (inaudible at 00:29:19).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">CLIENT: I don't watch any movies. And I think I remember why, after seeing this movie. Have you seen \"Mary Poppins\" yet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Maybe bits and pieces of it. [Laughs] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">CLIENT: So \"The Kids Are All Right\" and our session and whatever my state of mind was, which was so...ripe for poking...and my heart...yeah, it sort of just caused this huge explosion for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">In the movie, there's this lesbian couple that had-they live in California and they have-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. I'm remembering the trailer. It stars Annette Jeremyning and somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don't know names of actors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay; all right. Sorry, go ahead yeah, it's a lesbian couple in California.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:30) but sure. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">So they each have a kid with the same sperm donor. And their kids grow up and they-the older one turns 18 and the younger one is 15; it's a boy, wants to meet the sperm donor. And he convinces the 18-year-old to call him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">And he's just totally attractive and nice, funny guy. And basically the whole family falls in love with him, except the working, sort of the doctor, perfectionist, critical wife that the...more accepting, more outwardly, very loving gardener wife who doesn't work. And the daughter and the son, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201011\">all fall in love with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">So over the course of the movie...he sort of harvests all of them, I guess? And he sleeps with the wife, the gardener wife, who he had hired to do his garden.  Or she's not a gardener, she's like a landscape designer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">And they have this very exciting, hot sex, even though clearly she's not that...into his penis. But he's so in love with her and he wants her to leave the wife. And it's very tense and the other wife comes around and she's so angry, at the beginning, because she knows that this guy's come in and harvesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201051\">all of her family.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559897\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">But she comes around and she makes a big effort, and then the peak of her good will-at the peak of her good will, where she's finally learning to really like this guy, she finds her wife's hair in his drain and...and then they have this...very difficult...time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">And then the daughter goes to college the next week, or in three days or something. And the daughter going to college is-actually, the daughter, the whole time, is individuating in ways that I never, ever did, in the span of these few weeks. Where he comes to pick her up on his motorcycle and the doctor <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201091\">wife is like, \"You know how I feel about motorcycles, get off,\" and she doesn't listen to her. And then, later on...the doctor wife is coming to check on her and the daughter's like, \"Thanks for checking on me. It's nice to know-I know how you feel, thank you for your concern. I'm 18 now. I'm going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201092\">to make my own decision about the motorcycle.\"  \"I love you, bye,\" and she shuts the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">And...she goes away to college and they're trying to put her sheets on the bed and she's like, \"I just need some space, guys. I'll meet you outside.\" And she is alone in her room, putting her sheets on her bed, and she gets really sad and stops and then goes to find her family and they're not there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B1\">Then they come back; they had to park the (ph) car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">And then they say goodbye, and everybody's so sad because it is a goodbye; it's not, \"We'll see you when you visit,\" or, \"We'll see you,\" or, \"We'll (ph) call you.\"  There's none of that; it's, \"Goodbye.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">So I watched this movie. It's very funny and I cried a lot. And I watched it alone. Later at night, I...Jeremy was in bed doing something and I visited him and just started crying and I...felt so badly that I was going to cheat on him.  Because I told you I wanted to have an affair with you that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:36:17); and...but I'm noticing all of these things about these American families; about their way of saying goodbye and how their children are so aware of their parents' faults. And...whatever we talked about on Thursday made...made me feel pretty alienated from my parents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">And the fact that I don't have to talk to them about it, ever. But I want to. But it's probably because it's making me really anxious to...be thinking about them in...in a critical or more holistic (ph) way-a more whole way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">So that sucks, because I-it's hard to just hold onto it. And I'm going to have an affair. And I'm going to hurt Jeremy. And that I'm going to be an American person. And all of these bad things about America are going to seep into me. And my mom predicated the whole thing, because I didn't marry an Italian <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201171\">person.  And I will be lost forever. That was (inaudible at 00:38:12) people; it was very scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">CLIENT: Jeremy didn't really know what to do with me because it didn't-it doesn't make a whole lot of sense without his knowing what we talked about in here, (inaudible at 00:38:41). So when I was saying, \"I'm afraid I'm going to have an affair, I'm afraid I'm going to have an affair,\" it was not...it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B1\">sort of just added to the being upset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">CLIENT: I feel pressure to hold it together because I have to go soon; or you're going to ask me to go soon. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559897\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah.
