(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yes. Mid-March, no less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Just when you think it\u2019s over. (pause) I think things are going relatively well. I\u2019m noticing I\u2019m still feeling, (inaudible at 00:00:31) the depression and anxiety at times. I\u2019m noticing the anxiety particularly at work, if I feel like I don\u2019t have a lot of immediate to-dos on my list or at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">night when I want to go to sleep and I just feel really flooded. I\u2019m having a lot of nightmares, which is kind of destructive and I\u2019ll wake up and I\u2019ll be up for like an hour or so in the middle of the night because I\u2019m just all in my mind.  I\u2019ll even try to turn on the TV so that I have to fill my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">mind with something else, but it doesn\u2019t always work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: What are the nightmares? Do you remember any of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. I remember some of them. It would help if I journaled, but I had one about the house, about my parents\u2019 house. It was very weird. Every Thursday morning I have this meeting with my bosses, global surgery fellows, and it\u2019s at 7:00, so it\u2019s before work starts. (sighs) For whatever reason, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">the meeting was happening in the upstairs of my parents\u2019 house. It sounds silly \u2013 I guess a lot of dreams do out loud \u2013 but I was terrified. I was humiliated. I was mortified because they were in the upstairs of my parents\u2019 house \u2013 all these fancy surgeons \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t get to the meeting because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">I was downstairs in the dining room and we were having a meal and my mom cooked.  I remember thinking it\u2019s a big deal and I can\u2019t be rude. I need to be thankful of it, even though I\u2019m really upset. And I was so embarrassed. I remember my sister and I \u2013 I don\u2019t know if my sister even talked \u2013 (sighs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">but I got upset with my mom about her comment about the Valentine\u2019s Day flowers, how she didn\u2019t get any from my dad. It\u2019s really bizarre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: This is in the dream?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes. And I was really embarrassed because everyone was coming downstairs and were halfway to the door and, not only did I not make it to the meeting, but they heard me arguing and I was so embarrassed because of the house. That was one dream. I know \u2013 it\u2019s very bizarre; (chuckles) but it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">a dream. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Not a dream, exactly. I think it\u2019s [the same in your dream.] (ph?) When you say nightmare, were you at all terrified in the dream ever? Or did it feel more like a nightmare of embarrassment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the thing, I think it was terrifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It was? Exposed to them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s hard to explain because I think to most people it sounds like, \u201cSo your co-workers saw your parents\u2019 house when it was messy? How is that terrifying?\u201d But it\u2019s not like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: I can just imagine, actually, how that would be terrifying in your experience. I was just asking \u2013 you didn\u2019t describe it so much in that way when you were first telling it. It sounds like it was a kind of really anxious dread about what they saw and what was going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: It was just beyond humiliating. Yeah. I know that with a lot of these nightmares I\u2019m waking up and I\u2019m sweating and I\u2019m worked up. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Also let me just be clear I understand: you felt you had to stay at dinner downstairs . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I have no idea why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: . . . because your mom had cooked a nice meal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: We were all sitting down to eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: All, meaning your family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: No one else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: No. And I get that it\u2019s really bizarre, but that\u2019s how dreams are sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Things get a lot more bizarre than that, Ramona. Don\u2019t worry. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: So that was one; and then I had another that had something to do with the house. I don\u2019t remember a lot of that one. Then I had a nightmare close to a week ago. I ran out of time when I told you I was feeling really, really down because I keep going over \u2013 and I think it\u2019s still something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">weighs on my mind \u2013 but this whole thing of me telling Ivan that I would like him to write or even say something really positive about me.  I really want some reinforcement or \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 something to feel good about; and that I started to really I know it will probably be all or nothing to positive <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">thinking. Even though I understand it can be very complicated and for him now, with writing, he kind of feels like he can\u2019t do it and it\u2019s starting to feel like maybe it adds up. Maybe it is very black and white. Maybe all the websites on the list were indicative of him not loving me so there isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">anything nice to write. I had a nightmare where I found out that he was in love with someone else and she actually existed and I really found out about her. Her name is Lucy, which is bizarre. So that was one. I really remember next to nothing about it, but I was really scared and upset. I think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200394\">pretty clear where that comes from.  Then I had another nightmare. (chuckles) Then, again, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: For some reason, I was being held upside down and it was after I went to class. It was like an elementary-type school class and I don\u2019t know how old I was, but it was very basic, very low-pressure, and I couldn\u2019t answer the questions and I couldn\u2019t figure it out and I couldn\u2019t get it and I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Like with something that the teacher was doing at the board?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: No, I was being asked questions within the course and I don\u2019t know if there were really other people. I think there were other people in the class, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: And you weren\u2019t understanding?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I couldn\u2019t answer the questions and I don\u2019t know why. And then I looked in the hall or something and was being held upside down. I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: By whom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. But everything I learned was going to my head, which doesn\u2019t make sense, because the whole point of the dream was that I wasn\u2019t retaining anything and I wasn\u2019t learning anything. I think that one is pretty obvious because I\u2019ve been pretty consistently \u2013 I don\u2019t know if worked up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">is the right term or phrase \u2013 but worried that now that I\u2019m out of school I\u2019m losing things or I don\u2019t know what I want to do next or I\u2019m sometimes doing projects at work that aren\u2019t really meaningful to me or challenging and afraid that I\u2019m losing. So I think some of these are really crystal clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: There is a transparency, in a way, that they\u2019re not so strange that they\u2019re far away from your daytime experience, and yet I still wonder that there has been a chain of not-so-good dreams and a kind of anxiety, dread, terror dreams, even where, in a way, Ramona, there is kind of a common <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">thread about a part of yourself that you feel really insecure about. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yes, and I am aware of that level of insecurity, even as I fear . . . I feel really unloved by so many of the things that Ivan has done and I just want him to write something to me. And as clear as it is that he\u2019s going out of his way and doing some really difficult things and making lots of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">efforts, I still have this insecurity and this disappointment and this sadness my husband doesn\u2019t love me; I think this sadness that I\u2019m not very important to my parents, even though . . . It\u2019s complicated. Or in a week when my sister has had a really long week and she suggested hanging out, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">think she\u2019s probably too tired, I tell her, \u201cYou know, let\u2019s not,\u201d because I\u2019m worried that she\u2019s too nice to say she doesn\u2019t want to hang out.  That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening, but I\u2019m scared of it. The same thing with my friends \u2013 if they\u2019re not as in touch one week, I feel this insecurity and sadness <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D3\">and this kind of pulling back into the self-critical, self-dislike, hate, which doesn\u2019t feel good, obviously. It has me feeling anxious and down, so I\u2019m not sure where to go with that because I don\u2019t (sighs) want to slip. I felt so good about a lot of the work you\u2019ve helped me do to get out of that mindset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You know it\u2019s a vulnerability, Ramona, so it will ebb and flow, especially when certain things happen.  There is a way you\u2019re waiting for something in writing from Ivan that kind of increasingly has become something that\u2019s hanging in the air between the two of you and maybe every day that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">passes, it\u2019s starting to generate this anxiety. What if he doesn\u2019t love me and he has to say this positive? I know you don\u2019t probably intellectually know that that\u2019s true, but the feeling of waiting and wanting and hoping and each day there is nothing, I think that pulls you back more to those feelings. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">Again, it\u2019s an opportunity to get to know more about them and where they come from. There has to be so much self-loathing that\u2019s starting to just eat away and gnaw at you in your childhood. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Right now I think I\u2019m starting to be aware. I feel like this is part of depression, really \u2013 personalizing or magnifying things. So even though Ivan cooked dinner Thursday night, and Thursdays I always have a long day, he made a little footbath for me; just doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">a lot of sweet or thoughtful things and showing that he\u2019s trying. It\u2019s still there so there is a disconnect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201cstill there\u201d you mean feeling that way towards him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or even with my friends. My really good girlfriend from grad school is talking about how she and her boyfriend might move because she hates the weather here and they\u2019re from Arizona, that area, and they really want to go back.  And she\u2019s like, \u201cThe culture here, people are just so snobby,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">which I mean (laughs) it can be true in different parts of the city, I guess. I just felt like it was personal at me. I took it so personally like, \u201cShe\u2019s going to leave and we\u2019re not going to hang out anymore and I\u2019m not going to see her anymore. If I stay here and that\u2019s how everybody really is, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">does that say about me?\u201d That\u2019s so not what she was saying, but I just felt really sad and I also felt kind of insecure. Like I said, I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m really personalizing. Or like if Emma has a really long week and she is still willing to hang out, but she acknowledges that she\u2019s had a long week <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200553\">I\u2019m like, \u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t want to hang out.\u201d That\u2019s me, so I need to . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re recognizing the cognitive distortions and I think you know how to challenge those.  Maybe just that you\u2019re aware of them starts to work a step to disable that that\u2019s actually not personal, what she\u2019s saying, at all, but I\u2019m making it personal for some reason. Or you\u2019re magnifying the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">things that aren\u2019t getting done from Ivan, perhaps, but not really, and dismissing it, despite all the positive, loving things that he\u2019s doing towards you in forming the global assessment of whether he loves you or not. There is still, at the dynamic layer of what you\u2019re talking about, something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200572\">comes out in your dreams, Ramona. There is something about when you say \u201cpersonalizing,\u201d I think, that is an enormous process that was set in place when you were a kid and it comes up in your dream. For example, you have these surgeons over for a meeting, your work meeting, and you are mortified to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200573\">the point of dread and terror at what they will see about you when they come into the inside of your home.  I think there must have been (inaudible at 00:14:19) of how your home looked, what your parents were incapable of doing, that you had to internalize as meaning something about you. In other words, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200574\">if you had a friend over and they saw the house, would they judge you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a really hard thing. It\u2019s a really hard thing because I honestly grew up never having friends over because it was terrifying, embarrassing, humiliating; and it wasn\u2019t as simple as telling my parents, \u201cI really want to have people over, so can you clean up the house?\u201d  It just wasn\u2019t like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I totally get that that didn\u2019t happen and you\u2019ve said that before. I think the point is that you were already drawing a conclusion inside yourself that your friends would then think less of you. In other words, when someone feels mortified, it\u2019s a kind of personal mortification. Do you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">what I mean? Instead of feeling like, \u201cYeah, look at my incompetent parents. What\u2019s wrong with them, but this has nothing to do with me? I would have the house clean if I were the parents here,\u201d which, of course you couldn\u2019t think. You were the child. Of course that is personalized in a way in development. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">Do you know what I mean? It starts to feel like it\u2019s some representation of a part of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Right. And maybe I\u2019m stuck, but it still feels that way because, at a certain age, even at a really young age, there was an extent of a certain amount \u2013 even if it was really small and it grew and grew and grew \u2013 of what I could do.  And there is something really different between a middle school <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">or an elementary school kid and a high school or a middle school kid in which you can say . . .  As a teenager, if I were living at home and my parents never did any cleaning and my friends came over and I said, \u201cYou know my parents don\u2019t clean the house. It\u2019s not my fault. This is how it is.\u201d I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D2\">do something about it \u2013 maybe not all of it, but I still feel stuck in it not being my responsibility, but also not being something that I couldn\u2019t do anything about. So it still feels like a reflection on me. In theory, if you went over to someone\u2019s house and you found out that their parents didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D3\">take care of it, you would feel sad or worried about them or concerned or maybe even . . . I don\u2019t know. But I think as a kid you would be like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hang out here. Wow, this is what you\u2019re really like and you present something completely different at school.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Again, I totally get that as a kid, those are kind of safe judgments to be assuming that other people are making, right? Kids don\u2019t know better. Other kids wouldn\u2019t know better. An adult might walk in and say, \u201cWow, this is neglect of these two girls. What is going on in this household?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">and not, at all, put it on you. Even as teenagers, Ramona, at that point, that\u2019s when they need help from parents who have slowly been teaching them how to take on more and more responsibility based on the parents having been responsible parents. You didn\u2019t have any of that. (pause) I think the point <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">is there may be ways, as much as we\u2019re talking about \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to explain this \u2013 there is this side of you that feels maybe Ivan doesn\u2019t love you, there is another layer that when you say, \u201cWhat if I\u2019m with him and he has limitations? Is that reflected poorly on me?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really scary for me and I think it\u2019s part of what drives the . . . Right now I just constantly feel like, \u201cWhat am I going to do next? Am I going to go back to school? How long am I going to work here? What\u2019s my next job going to be? When am I going to earn more money?\u201d and feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">I\u2019m losing everything. \u201cRight now I\u2019m not accomplishing anything. This is terrible. I\u2019m surrounded by a lot of these people who are surgeons.\u201d (sighs) My boss is an MD, DMD, MBA. (both chuckle) He\u2019s a crazy overachiever, so sometimes it\u2019s really easy to feel like might be part of the nature of the job <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">to feel that I\u2019ve not gotten very far.  But I think part of it is sometimes, too \u2013 I don\u2019t know; it sounds really bizarre \u2013 but feeling like Ivan needs more time and needs more of something to figure out what he wants to do. And as much as there is nothing wrong with him working at Subway, it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200613\">feel as okay for me to be okay with where I\u2019m at if he\u2019s also really okay where he\u2019s at. And he is at a very different place from where we both thought he would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s see if this makes any sense. Again, there may be a kind of overt part of what you\u2019re talking about, Ramona, which is simply that you\u2019re getting re-triggered back into self-loathing, a real sort of formalized self-loathing. There may also be ways \u2013 you know how we talked about as a kid <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">it was a coping strategy for you to blame yourself for things that were not your responsibility because, at least, then it was in your control.  So I have to wonder if there isn\u2019t also, alongside the self-loathing, a part of you that\u2019s also getting stirred up about \u201cis it okay that Ivan is (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">at 00:20:22). What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d or \u201cis it okay that he works at Subway?\u201d In fact, he\u2019s not in the same place as you developmentally. You\u2019ve gone on and gotten your Master\u2019s degree. You\u2019ve graduated. You now have a job in your field, after having graduated from (inaudible at 00:20:42). So your <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200633\">own criticism and wondering \u201cis this good enough for me?\u201d I think sometimes has been staring you in the face because as a kid you couldn\u2019t really sit in that place. There was nothing you could do.  You can\u2019t just criticize your parents and decide, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go get a new set of parents because I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200634\">think these ones are good enough.\u201d Right? So you blamed yourself. You turned a lot of the things that you were disappointed in, but you were turning that back on yourself as a way to control it. I wonder if there is not another kind of layer of that \u2013 the things Ivan is not doing, you\u2019re slowly turning <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200635\">it inside and internalizing it as your problem. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: Maybe. It\u2019s hard because sometimes I\u2019ll really (inaudible at 00:21:35) after months and months. Since he\u2019s started working at Subway, I\u2019ve stopped asking him to apply for a new job because he has taken a lot on his plate and he really is working very hard on personal goals and working on our <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">marriage. I mean, he\u2019s now the type of person who is now making dinner every night and picking me up from the T and doing his share of the chores.  He has really done that, so it\u2019s great and I know a job search is stressful. I don\u2019t want to ask for everything and not get anything, but it\u2019s really hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">sometimes because . . . For example, next month he\u2019s going to have eleven days off. He has no choice. They\u2019re remodeling the store and he\u2019s going to have a lot of days off. He\u2019s like, \u201cRamona, why don\u2019t we go away somewhere?\u201d This sounds wonderful because we have never gone anywhere together outside <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200653\">of our honeymoon. I would love to, except my thought is, \u201cIvan, if you have eleven days off, this sounds like a wonderful opportunity and kind of a stress-free \u2013 not stress-free \u2013 but an ideal way to sit down and do some informational interviews or fill out some applications or brush up your resume <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200654\">or even start volunteering on the weekend somewhere.\u201d  It\u2019s hard because I want that really badly for him and he told me the other day, \u201cI just really want to focus on our marriage right now. I feel like I can\u2019t take on . . .\u201d and it\u2019s tough because of course that\u2019s what I want to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a part of what you want to hear. You would also like to hear him say, \u201cAnd I\u2019m also going to be working on my career.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: I said, \u201cIvan, be careful because I think there could be a lot of very legitimate reasons to put off a job search or put off even building your resume outside of this now.\u201d Just like that, he\u2019s been at Subway for a year and he never intended to stay that long. I said, \u201cJust be careful because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">I think by that reasoning, you could go a few more years, which wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world, but at some point if you do want to apply for something different or you do want to go back to school, they might wonder why, if you\u2019re really passionate about this, you\u2019ve been working in the food and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200692\">beverage industry.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: And not just for his future prospects, also be careful because this impacts the marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s getting to be (sighs) kind of a touchy point when we go for groceries and we\u2019re trying to take turns buying groceries every other week because now our accounts are separate and he gets really aggressive. The other day, he literally pushed me out of the way like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m paying for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">this.\u201d I feel horrible because I\u2019m sure he feels kind of emasculated. I\u2019m sure he feels like he\u2019s got to prove something. But then I figure, \u201cIvan, if you pay for this, can you make a loan payment this month? Will you have enough to pay Dr. Bourd? You have to think about that.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D2\">I won\u2019t, but . . .\u201d And it\u2019s just hard because it\u2019s uncomfortable for both of us.

It\u2019s just uncomfortable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I think this is a layer of what\u2019s getting presented in your dream about \u201cam I stuck down here with my embarrassing family?\u201d With Ivan, with the things that embarrass you about him, while these surgeons are upstairs in their meeting \u2013 this division of worlds somehow. Then alternatively, \u201cIf <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">I choose to stay, what does that say about me? Am I not that great or not that lovable?\u201d That comes up in your other dreams, too. And I\u2019m not saying from that that that is exactly what it means, that Ivan is actually just like your family, but I think that it\u2019s a lot that gets stirred for you about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F2\">fearing the same thing is happening; you\u2019re going to be stuck inside this embarrassing house and not be able to feel proud and like you want to make Ivan publicly known and that he\u2019s someone that you feel good about. And that then you, yourself, is someone you can feel good about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Sometimes I think it\u2019s not. Maybe it does have to do with Ivan, but sometimes I think on just feeling embarrassed and kind of ashamed that I married at a relatively young age. Twenty-five isn\u2019t the youngest thing in the world, but we\u2019ve been married a couple of years and I just think back on <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200711\">getting married at 23 and I feel kind of embarrassed and ashamed. Sometimes it\u2019s almost like I don\u2019t want to tell people that I\u2019m married now, not because I\u2019m trying to pretend and not be married, but because I don\u2019t want to be thought of as a stereotype, like someone who leaves high school or college <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200712\">and gets married right away and has children right away. Not that there is anything necessarily wrong with that, but a lot of people here would look down on that very, very partially. And that\u2019s not me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you might worry about looking down at yourself partially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, for getting married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: Like what? What is your own judgment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: For getting married at too young an age, for being immature, for not accomplishing a lot as a result, for being na\u00efve, for not being as prepared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Not accomplishing a lot as a result \u2013 you mean like (crosstalk at 00:27:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: Now I\u2019m married, so I don\u2019t need to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And too young means too young to know what was really good for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, just too young to be married, like young and immature or looking at some of these people, like at work, who are on their way. They\u2019re already surgeons and they\u2019re not married and they don\u2019t have families and they don\u2019t have time for them. Some of them are married and they do have families <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">and they don\u2019t have time for them, but thinking, \u201cWow, they put years in building up things before they even thought about having that type of lifestyle.\u201d  Secretly, I think sometimes I worry, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t get to go back to school if I want or need to because I got married?\u201d Ivan couldn\u2019t handle <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200812\">it. Sometimes I\u2019m terrified, \u201cWhat if I had children before I was 30?\u201d I would be terrified of that. Not because I don\u2019t ever want to have children, but because they\u2019ll be partially judged.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: I really have to wonder how much, when you bring that up about other people, how much is simply you pulling back inside yourself that these are your own harsh judgments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: To some extent it is, but then there are times . . . And, again, I think I personalize it to a certain extent. There is a girl I work with who is fresh out of college. She is younger than me by three years. (laughs) Not much younger, but it feels like a lot younger. It feels like we\u2019re in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200851\">much different place. She dates and whatever, but she was like, \u201cOh, I assume people got married young because they wanted to have babies right away.\u201d  And I was so humiliated and embarrassed and pictured myself (laughs) in like a little House on the Prairie type of scenario, like that\u2019s all I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200852\">ever do with my life because I got married young and I was just so (sighs) ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: You could hear her comment as a positive thing, not as really a negative thing. You immediately take it negatively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: It sounded judgmental. I don\u2019t know. Or like my really great, close friend from grad school. She and her boyfriend lived together and he actually proposed a few years ago. She would have been roughly our age, I guess; like when we got married, roughly around there when he proposed. Her parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">did not approve. They still don\u2019t approve of him. They don\u2019t like him. He treats her great, so I don\u2019t know why. The point is that at one point he made a comment and it was not, I think, meant to be how it felt, but he was like, \u201cCrazy kids, getting married young.\u201d  He just said something like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200892\">and he was like, \u201cNo offense, Ramona.\u201d I just felt so judged and I felt kind of angry because they kind of have the same lifestyle that we do; we\u2019re just married. (sighs) So I think some of it is personal, as I said, but sometimes it also feels . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t going to be people out there who, for whatever reason inside themselves, have a judgment of that; but there are just as many people . . . I know people who have gone through medical school, have their career trajectory, and sit in a tremendous amount of regret <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B1\">because they are now past the age of having children or it\u2019s going to be difficult to have children. They haven\u2019t even found a relationship and really, really regret the way that they did things and could feel envious of you or envious \u2013 look at people with their own projections of \u201cI wish I had done <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B2\">it that way.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s kind of the sad thing that bugged me about that comment because I felt like it maybe was a kind of sour grapes type of comment because he obviously did want to marry her, and now he doesn\u2019t because her parents won\u2019t allow it or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">CLIENT: But then sometimes I think about it and I\u2019m like, \u201cBut maybe they\u2019re smart because after what Ivan did, if we were Kevin and Helen, maybe I would have left because all it would mean was moving and you broke up with your boyfriend.\u201d Not to diminish that that can be devastating, but it\u2019s different <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200911\">from getting a divorce. So sometimes I just feel like I\u2019m too young. My gosh, I\u2019m 25 and I\u2019m going to couple\u2019s counselling with my husband. That\u2019s crazy. I bet nobody who is 25 goes to couple\u2019s counselling. That\u2019s how it feels, like I\u2019m too young to have those problems. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s the heart of the matter. You are struggling, in a way, looking at the dissidence and wondering if you regret them. Is there something you wish you had done differently? And I think the more, Ramona \u2013 you know we used to talk about how you could externalize one half of a debate <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200931\">and then hold the pole to argue against the other half and part of reincorporating both sides because they actually are both yours? It\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t out there, too. People could judge you for getting married young. People can and will judge people for getting married too old. People judge people <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200932\">for marrying the wrong person. You could find anyone who is going to have any judgment on any decision you make. Good for them. People have transferences. It\u2019s not saying that their judgments will be great. Here, this example of your friend is a good example. He is judging based on his own history of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200933\">rejection. That\u2019s why he\u2019s judging.  That\u2019s the root of it. His judgment has nothing to do with you, even though he\u2019s making it, in his mind, have something to do with you. It has nothing to do with you. What does have to do with you is what you think. Do you know what I mean? There are just as many <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200934\">people who get married at 23 who feel like they made a great decision and feel comfortable with it or have some regret, but some feeling of \u201cthank goodness I did.\u201d Or are totally regretful and get divorced. I think you\u2019re just trying to find what your experience is, what your feelings are about it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200935\">whether you regret it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">CLIENT: I think I don\u2019t regret it, but I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared that we\u2019ve had some really significant problems. I\u2019m scared that I didn\u2019t know some things about Ivan when we got married. Sometimes I look back and nobody told me that I didn\u2019t have to take full credits, like take Biochemistry and study <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200951\">for the DRE\u2019s and apply to grad school and register for grad school and plan a wedding all in the same year.  Nobody told me like, \u201cRamona, it\u2019s okay that you love him and you want to get married. You don\u2019t have to do it this year. He\u2019ll still be around next year.\u201d I wish someone would have said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200952\">to me. That doesn\u2019t mean that I regret marrying Ivan, but I just wish (sighs) (chuckles) . . . I feel like I always have so much pressure and it\u2019s like what\u2019s the next thing? That\u2019s how I keep going or keep afloat, even if things are really bad at home or things are really bad with Ivan. I can still <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200953\">look back and say that I finished school or I got the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20097\">THERAPIST: That it may have actually been a kind of symptom, in a way, to get married so urgently, of your being so driven forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20099\">CLIENT: Right.

Had the wedding.\u201d  It\u2019s not a calm, content place for it to come from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D\">CLIENT: Sometimes I\u2019m scared because we\u2019re young now and I just worried that people change. So far, I\u2019ve seen some really not-good changes in Ivan, but I\u2019ve also seen some really amazing changes in him that I didn\u2019t think were possible at a certain time; and I feel really good about that. But for whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D1\">reason, the depressive thinking, I worry, \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t stop working at Subway? What if he never writes a note? Is that really okay?\u201d even if I say, \u201cI understand; it\u2019s just a note.\u201d It really bothers me. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re feeling disappointed and scared. What if this disappointment stays? What if this part of him doesn\u2019t change, even though there is a lot that\u2019s been changing? You have often talked about what if you\u2019re here and he\u2019s been here in development and he does a lot that catches him <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009F1\">up, but he\u2019s still here. What is enough that\u2019s good enough for you to feel that this is worth keeping? And what is not enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the thing lately that I find myself thinking. I said this to Ivan. Since the last assault, since we\u2019ve been really working back and we\u2019re building trust, I feel like we\u2019ve restored so much of the friendship and I feel wonderful about that.  I really look forward to spending time with <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A11\">him. We spend time together, a lot of positive time together, and I love it. But of course, (chuckles) because this is what I do, what if we don\u2019t sleep in the bed again? What if we don\u2019t ever have a romantic part of the relationship again? What if \u2013 fill in the blank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A3\">THERAPIST: What do you think? What if you didn\u2019t have any sexual contact? Is that what you were referring to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes. I think there is a lot more to the romantic part of the relationship than just physical stuff, but I think I\u2019m just as scared that it will happen than that it won\u2019t. Dr. Farrow told me to stop trying to have him sleep in the bed because she said I\u2019m making it worse. She said all the times <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A51\">I woke up and I was scared, \u201cit\u2019s PTSD and you\u2019re making it worse,\u201d so now I feel frustrated because . . .  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Because you like to move forward?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I even said to her in the sessions, I think it\u2019s important that we talk about the really big things \u2013 and bringing up in the session that I felt like Ivan was really avoiding other things, it did not go well, but I said nothing personal with her, (scoffs) but I don\u2019t want to be in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200A91\">couple\u2019s counselling forever. My goal would be for us to get to a point where we would be . . . (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Of course. That\u2019s not personal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AD\">CLIENT: Right. And to me, in my mind we do need to check things off the list that we\u2019ve talked about it. We move forward; we resolve; Ivan does move into the bed again. We eventually have sex again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF\">THERAPIST: She may have just been responding \u2013 I had communicated that you had been having some pretty intense anxiety and, I think, PTSD-like symptoms. I think I called it that in a communication to her, but I didn\u2019t say that I felt that that meant that you shouldn\u2019t keep doing it.  It sounds like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF1\">she\u2019s worried that you may be kind of masochistically putting yourself back there too early or something. I don\u2019t have a strong opinion about whether that\u2019s what\u2019s happening or not. I think you\u2019re experimenting and you would like it to work. And I think if you feel, Ramona, like \u201cit is working for us <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200AF2\">and I want to try it again,\u201d you should be able to say that to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B1\">CLIENT: I just worry that if I don\u2019t try \u2013 I\u2019m going to be scared, but if I don\u2019t try, I\u2019m still going to be scared. It\u2019s just that at some point, it has to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And there is as much fear of it actually going well and becoming more intimate or romantically involved is just as scary as not, is what you were just saying. They are both sides of what if you both move forward in your developments together?  Who are you, then, as a couple? You\u2019ve known <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200B31\">this for a while. What happens when that changes? It\u2019s a different level of intimacy. (pause) You know your own feelings about am I good enough? Will he love this person? Will he hurt me? Will he be attracted to me? All the different kinds of anxiety about getting closer to someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B5\">CLIENT: And I think the idea of functioning that way as a couple is scary to me and, again, I come back to \u2013 this part, I feel, is definitely unfounded \u2013 to thinking I\u2019m too young to have that type of a relationship with a man. He\u2019s my husband, but it feels like I\u2019m too young to be having that part <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200B51\">of my daily routine and part of my life and not be embarrassed or ashamed, to be confident about that.  That I know other people don\u2019t feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so interesting. It\u2019s so important, like it almost feels like it\u2019s a part of you that isn\u2019t the age you are. You\u2019re talking about \u201cdid I get married too young?\u201d I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m ready for this yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like a little girl at her mom\u2019s heels. (chuckles) That\u2019s kind of the image I get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BB\">THERAPIST: And that place is not going to feel very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BD\">CLIENT: That, I know, is bizarre because I feel that having sex at 25, people don\u2019t consider that too young. No one would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, forget other people, whether they think it\u2019s normal or not.  There is something you\u2019re noticing about how that range of your self-experience doesn\u2019t feel your age. When you say it, I\u2019m curious how your little girl feels the subject, even the pre-teen sense of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C1\">CLIENT: Which is bizarre, because in other areas I think I have pretty high expectations or am pretty rigid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And sort of a precociously mature sense of competence and self, almost too adult, before you were even adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C5\">CLIENT: And that that\u2019s almost the expectation, the standard, not something extraordinary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C7\">THERAPIST: There are ways, Ramona \u2013 we have to stop \u2013 but so much of you lived in a kind of anxiety and a hyper-competence, hyper-independence, hyper-taking care of things, hyper-adult-like state.  One of the things that happens when that has to happen in a family because things are not getting taken <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C71\">care of by parents is that other parts of you can remain underdeveloped. Because the other parts had to so overdevelop, that takes up a lot of psychic space. So this other part, where it\u2019s more about a relaxed bodily enjoyment, a physical enjoyment, pleasure, relaxed pleasure \u2013 there was no room for <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C72\">that as a kid. I don\u2019t mean sexual, but I mean the kind of subtler, quieter versions of that being on a continuum of experience. There was no room for that, so it makes some sense that this would be an underdeveloped area. Maybe it would be helpful for me to just drop a clarifying line to Dr. Farrow <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C73\">and say I don\u2019t think your only experience with this is just something to say where you\u2019re coming from now, but maybe it\u2019s something that would help if Ivan would talk about it and talk to each other more.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735372\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C9\">CLIENT: Perhaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200CD\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
