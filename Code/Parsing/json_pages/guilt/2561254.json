ACA, which has a national presence you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Right. I was \u2013 my experience was being the graduate student volunteer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Thursday was fine because it was a pre-conference day and I was one of two graduate students who were helping out in this whole thing and it was really, it was okay, but Friday and Saturday \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I \u2013 thinking that they need a little bit more help or a little bit more coordination.

I\u2019m thinking disorganization and you know it\u2019s like people will usually come and work all day for you with not much more than a pat on the head, but there were not many pats on the head going on and \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s too bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I\u2019m sorry that that was just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: So maybe somebody wasn\u2019t very mindful about when they were supposed to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Oh, my goodness. Well I am sorry you didn\u2019t have a good experience, that\u2019s too bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Well no, no, but I was there for the all day with the presenters, or the \u2013 when they did their thing you know on wellness and you know their models based on Adlerian and so it was really interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: It was a good day. I won\u2019t say I had a bad experience, it was just like little hiccups there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: All right. Well how have you been? It\u2019s been a couple of weeks since we\u2019ve seen one another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Okay. Yeah I think (pause) trying to get back \u2013 I\u2019m running out of a meeting so I\u2019m like shifting gears. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Sure, shift focus, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: The \u2013 I think the experience has been that I had been more in tune with what I\u2019m feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Okay, you mean over the last couple of weeks since we\u2019ve been talking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Okay, tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Well I think one experience that I had, I think it was pretty much like right on the heels of leaving here, you know going home that evening and kind of recognizing that over the years you know, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve kind of allowed this pattern to happen where you know my life gets arranged for me and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">I get the memo. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: Here\u2019s \u2013 here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and you know it\u2019s never really done you know, (pause) oh, I don\u2019t know what the word would be. It\u2019s not done like you will do this kind of thing, but it\u2019s more like you know there was some innocuous thing, like it was a profit \u2013 or a charity breakfast after church. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s like I already feel like church is kind of this obligatory thing that I do and I go to get my card punched and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: (laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Justify my health insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Okay, right (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (chuckle) But then it was like \u2013 so there\u2019s this \u2013 this breakfast that happened, or was happening afterwards, but I was just like, no I\u2019m not really interested in doing that. You know and it was like \u2013 so I recognized that I kind of did that maybe a little quickly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Maybe a little abruptly. It was just like, no I\u2019m not interested in going there. And it was like \u2013 it was enough of a shock that it was like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Okay, well what\u2019s wrong? (chuckle) Which you know was like (laugh) no, I just don\u2019t want to do it you know. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: What \u2013 that\u2019s pretty significant. So you know you kind of had your day planned for you. You know and this is sort of the norm. And then you \u2013 you said I\u2019m not doing this part of the day and you know, what was that like for you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh I think that I was really \u2013 I felt fine about that.

It\u2019s like don\u2019t need to be quite as abrupt. (chuckle) You know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like yeah, you can just say well yeah, you know thanks for thinking about me here, but yeah, I\u2019m really not so much interested in doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: You know I\u2019ve got some other things or some other thoughts you know about my day. You know so I could have perhaps done it a little bit. But either way, irregardless, you know it was like you know just being able to say, no, I\u2019m not going to, I\u2019m not going there, so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And it sounds like you feel okay about stating that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah and I feel like \u2013 I think that it was that that was good to be able to do that kind of thing and I recognize that \u2013 that I\u2019ve gotten into such a pattern \u2013 our lives have gotten into such a pattern that that kind of thing happens and it happens almost like automatically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: That \u2013 that your day being planned for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Weeks, months, years, whatever. And I\u2019m just like okay. Yeah. You know and it\u2019s not that it\u2019s even an intentional thing anymore. It\u2019s just that this is normative behavior. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Right. Right the way that we do things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t like it anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure I liked it ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Probably not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s like yeah. You know, it\u2019s just that life in the past with the kids in high school and grade school or whatever, that life just seems like it was happening so quickly that it\u2019s like okay, whatever, yeah, just you know, tell me what I need to do. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: And just kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not okay anymore. Not that it ever was. But I you know, I wonder \u2013 I mean that\u2019s in some ways very powerful. A small change. You are empowered to make a small change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And she responded to the change. Now she was surprised, but it doesn\u2019t sound like there was an argument or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: No, there was you know some questioning about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Sure because it broke the pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And maybe you know a little bit of lobbying, but not \u2013 not too much. But I just yeah. I recognized that you know doing that kind of helps you recognize how much of that kind of thing is still continuing to go on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You know it has me thinking a couple of things. I think that sometimes married men are socialized into accepting certain things, to go along to get along. To not rock the boat. Whether it\u2019s kind of you know and I\u2019ll use the example of my own marriage. One of the things that my husband <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">and I try to work out, and I think it\u2019s a process. You know where he would do something, but he\u2019d be really irritated about it. But he wouldn\u2019t tell me he was irritated, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">And so I think he was like I\u2019ll just her up or we\u2019ll just go along to get along. And I said to him, I said, well how would I know that you\u2019re irritated or angry about that? Because you haven\u2019t told me. And he said I really have to make an effort to do that. It\u2019s anti male in some ways. And it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">what I\u2019m used to. He\u2019s black British. So you add male plus emotional repression as \u2013 and he would tell you this, okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And so I thought about it and he has to work hard to say to me, what you did pissed me off. Or you know it really made me angry. And I always have to work hard to not react to it. But just that little bit. And we are not 25 years in like you are, okay. But change the pattern, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">And so he has to make an effort, but I\u2019m appreciative at least knowing. I\u2019d rather know that he\u2019s pissed or angry because I think that in working with couples, and you\u2019ll see this in your own clinical work. Sometimes we get socialized into these patterns, and we may not even like the pattern, but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">just easier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">And I think men a lot of the times are like you know what just do it. Just shut up and do it. And then years later you find I don\u2019t even want to be doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You know so I \u2013 it makes me wonder what other changes you can make because you have felt disempowered in your marriage for so long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And like you couldn\u2019t change things feeling stuck. Which leads to kind of helplessness, hopelessness and a kind of feeling of just like you know, being stuck in your own life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And you just did that and you just became unstuck. Not completely, but just in that little I\u2019m not doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Tell me your thoughts about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: No, I think just the sense of yeah, trying to figure out that you know kind of what you just said. That\u2019s like all right, let\u2019s try to be a little bit more intentional about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: You know and it\u2019s like you know, (pause) starting to get to a place of being able to recognize \u2013 recognize the feeling as it\u2019s arising. That \u2013 that recognition of okay, this is whatever. This is anger. It\u2019s like this is anger about you just writing my whole weekend for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like being able to be with that. To be with that emotion and then use it as you know, a \u2013 a positive beacon or something. It\u2019s like you know, this might be a good time for you to like tell her what you\u2019re feeling here. You know as opposed to just like, I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB1\">I\u2019m not going to go into that place and being frustrated. So. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That\u2019s kind of \u2013 that\u2019s kind of huge though. I mean you \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: (big sigh) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I mean you \u2013 no, but it kind of is because you\u2019ve \u2013 you\u2019ve sort of been in the pattern of burying it and repressing it, kind of choking it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, for years, for decades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And you made it \u2013 okay, but you just made a huge \u2013 I don\u2019t want to minimize how significant it is. Even though it seems like a small change. You said I\u2019m not doing that. And it seems small. It\u2019s actually huge because you had to not only recognize what you were feeling, acknowledge it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">then act on it. Like you had to do something with it in the moment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">You know if we \u2013 if we move it that example out of your marriage and you know, since you are a counseling student. You know often times in my supervision of students, when you feel something with a client, now you have to take it and do something. You have to channel it into your interventions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And because it means something. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Say \u2013 say that again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Okay. So you know, in a \u2013 in any situation. But in a clinical situation when you feel something with a client \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: So you\u2019re talking you the counselor feels something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: You have to \u2013 so this \u2013 I guess what I\u2019m trying to do is say, you\u2019re starting this with your marriage, but eventually you\u2019re going to use this personally and professionally. You don\u2019t throw out an emotion you\u2019re feeling and invalidate it. It\u2019s all meaningful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: So you take it, if you\u2019re bored, or angry or scared or irritated or whatever. And you\u2019ve got to take it and you channel it into your interventions. You do something with it. And that\u2019s exactly what you did with your wife. You \u2013 you got unstuck. You\u2019ve been stuck and that \u2013 that little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB1\">of saying something, taking your anger or irritation that you\u2019ve been burying for so long and saying no, I\u2019m not going to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">Whatever you said is less significant that you one, felt it. Two, acknowledged it and three, said something. That\u2019s pretty amazing actually. It\u2019s not a small thing, Seamus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: All right, well I\u2019ll sit with that. It feels \u2013 it feels insignificant. You know because like whatever. It feels like (chuckling) in looking at trying to move the entire mountain it\u2019s like well you know I\u2019ve just taken a table spoon and I just you know. (laugh) It\u2019s not \u2013 I get the \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the mountain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: The mountain of you know, decades of not \u2013not being honest. Not being able to speak or you know, whatever you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Is she the mountain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: No, no, I think you know to me, you know not being able to express my feelings. You know it\u2019s like \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: But you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: I did. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: And what if you re-conceptualize it. You\u2019re not trying to move a mountain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.

It seems like a small intervention, but the process you went through to do that intervention is huge. And typically, since you are allowing yourself to sit with these emotions, more things are going to come out of that. You know the next time you have \u2013 I bet you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D1\">you\u2019re not going to be able to be quiet the next time your life gets planned for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: Oh, no.

You should go do that. And I recognized kind of what was going on there. And it was just like I have really \u2013 you know if you really wanted to go to this and it was going to be like the two of us going to do this, you know I would consider talking about this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B1\">because it would be like a different avenue.

I\u2019m really not wanting to go do this by myself. And it was not \u2013 it was not as big an issue as maybe other things.

I think that the bottom line is that if we were two strangers that were meeting and it\u2019s like \u2013 yeah I\u2019m not so sure that this would be relationship material here. So I\u2019m like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: Do you like your wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: (pause) (sigh) Wow.

Yeah this \u2013 this gets at you know the \u2013 the big myths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">THERAPIST: Tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know the myths of you have to like \u2013 you have to like your wife right? That\u2019s \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t. Yeah you know it\u2019s \u2013 the dichotomies of loving someone but not liking them. Liking someone, not loving them. And love and like, and like love and hate living in the same house. You know my dad was a therapist, teacher and some other things. And he taught me \u2013 he had some \u2013 his <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D1\">parents were \u2013 he was a great dad. But his parents were pretty abusive. And he didn\u2019t like them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">THERAPIST: And I \u2013 and they were great grandparents, which is the ironic thing, but he \u2013 he told me when I was an adolescent, I don\u2019t like them. I love them. But I don\u2019t like them. And I recognize from the \u2013 his perspective of all the things that he had to endure that they weren\u2019t likable to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">So I kind of understood that you can love someone deeply, or not. And not like them. And like is \u2013 like is what often can change in a marriage. And there are times when you like someone very much and then sometimes you don\u2019t like them. And so for me, saying I like someone or I don\u2019t like. It\u2019s easy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201731\">There are times I like my husband very much. And times I\u2019m like ooh, I don\u2019t like you right now. Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: So for me it would be easier to say. For you it\u2019s more complicated. And we\u2019ve talked about some childhood factors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">THERAPIST: But you know that really caused a conflict for you.

But it\u2019s \u2013 you know it puts me in a more vulnerable position I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Why vulnerable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">CLIENT: Because I looked \u2013 I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m \u2013 again, you know it\u2019s like that (chuckle) you know I\u2019m facing my worst fear which is you\u2019re not going to like me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">THERAPIST: Tell me about why that\u2019s your worst fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. I \u2013 I think that just in \u2013 in other situations it always feels like you know, other in past counseling situations or past spiritual direction sessions. It always feels to me like you know, that that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s this underlying theme or monster or demon, or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">It\u2019s just like yeah, would you look at that, you know your whole life is wrapped up around needing to please other people. Needing to be liked by other people. And it\u2019s like look at how much crap you\u2019ve gotten into because you can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t either tell people what you really think, or you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202451\">be honest about what you feel, or you go along and do things because you don\u2019t want to hurt somebody else\u2019s feelings. Blah, blah, blah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">Maybe even get yourself into an engaged relationship with somebody because you were worried about what they might think about you. And I\u2019m gughh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20249\">THERAPIST: How \u2013 how do you think that\u2019s operated in here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024B\">CLIENT: (pause) (sigh) Well I feel like it\u2019s less in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024F\">CLIENT: Well, for the most part I think, you know I feel a sense of trust in this relation \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20251\">THERAPIST: Do you think I like you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20253\">CLIENT: (pause) Maybe it\u2019s about the story of the counselor client relationship. It\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t matter if you like me. (laugh) It\u2019s much or something, I\u2019m not sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20255\">THERAPIST: So it \u2013 I have to be as the counselor, attracted to the story. I can\u2019t just like you, Seamus. I\u2019m interested in the story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20257\">CLIENT: No that\u2019s not what I was trying to say I don\u2019t think. You know for me it\u2019s not the \u2013 there\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s not the expectation. (pause) You know why is it more important for you know, I\u2019m kind of stuck on that one. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20259\">THERAPIST: You know I understand from what you\u2019ve talked about where the desire to be liked comes from because you know you were in a family where you didn\u2019t feel like you belonged with your brothers. In some ways with your parents. You know the choices that you\u2019ve made. I get that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025B\">And there\u2019s sometimes that with depression comes that. But here\u2019s the biggest unfortunate thing of all is, at least from my interactions with you. And I\u2019m not blowing smoke here. You\u2019re really likeable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025D\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025F\">THERAPIST: And if you say you haven\u2019t tried, well then you\u2019re likeable but you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. Because if what you\u2019ve told me is true, then you\u2019re working so hard to be liked that you don\u2019t know that you actually are and you probably don\u2019t have to work at it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2025E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">CLIENT: Um-hum. Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">THERAPIST: Right. And so going back to our conversation about if your wife likes you and if you like your wife. Let\u2019s say you guys don\u2019t like each other very much. Let\u2019s just say that. Well then you\u2019re working really hard for something you\u2019re not going to get. Let\u2019s say, you don\u2019t like her and she doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202631\">like you. Then all the things that you have done to go along to get along, and you\u2019re angry, resentful. She\u2019s angry, resentful. And there are these mutual force fields up as we\u2019ve talked about. That\u2019s not working. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">CLIENT: Um-hum. Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">THERAPIST: So \u2013 so in some ways, what the hell?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">THERAPIST: Right? Why not \u2013 and I\u2019m not trying to make it \u2013 I think it\u2019s much more harder. It\u2019s much more difficult than this. I\u2019m not saying you know, well what the hell, just throw it out the window. But kind of like what the hell. Let\u2019s say you guys don\u2019t like each other. Well, that means you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B1\">it\u2019s probably not going to get a whole lot worse. Maybe you\u2019re concern of the image of the withdrawal of what? I mean there\u2019s the withdrawal of emotional support that\u2019s already there. There\u2019s the withdrawal of physical affection which is already there. What are \u2013 what\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s the loss here? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah. Exactly. Then I think it starts to become \u2013then I think it starts to become like the social things. You know it\u2019s like then \u2013 then it becomes like keeping up appearances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">THERAPIST: Yes and I mean, that\u2019s important to you and to her. And in some ways especially to her from what you\u2019ve said, yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah. Yeah I think so. I mean \u2013 I mean there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s the kids, there\u2019s the cultural thing, there\u2019s her job. You know it\u2019s like yeah, you know this is a good \u2013 this is a good package. You know this is a good gig. A good act to you know to be playing, you know and. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m not saying what the hell, throw it out the window.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m not getting that from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019m saying what the hell, you \u2013 you since \u2013 if you \u2013 if you accept that to be the truth, and I don\u2019t know that it is. But let\u2019s just you know, say that that\u2019s the truth, it actually would give you the opportunity to make some changes. Because what you fear has happened already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20279\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah, I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve actually had that thought before too, that\u2019s right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027D\">CLIENT: Yeah the metaphor might be something like (pause) the guy who\u2019s out you know, standing out in front of his house talking to a you know, an insurance agent about you know fire insurance. And the picture in the back is you know, the house is smoldering, it\u2019s just ashes. (chuckle) You know it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2027D1\">like, really dude?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20281\">CLIENT: (chuckle) What\u2019s \u2013 what are you \u2013 what are you insuring here, you know. And I think it\u2019s habitual behavior. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20283\">THERAPIST: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20285\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like it\u2019s \u2013 this is the way I react in every situation. And it \u2013 it\u2019s like \u2013 Pavlovian dog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20287\">THERAPIST: See you\u2019re telling yourself that, but you\u2019ve changed it. Well yeah, but you\u2019re not a dog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20289\">CLIENT: (laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028B\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019ve change it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve change it. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s significant. Because if you can change that, you can\u2019t change her. But sometimes \u2013 I mean and we often with our spouses create \u2013 given our history and the context \u2013 what we think is going on inside their heads. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2028E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20291\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20293\">THERAPIST: Sometimes we\u2019re right. Sometimes we\u2019re not. But if the worst has happened, if the house is already on fire, or smoldering, or burned to ashes, in some ways, you know you can allow your own voice to be heard, and re-teach yourself about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20295\">CLIENT: Um-hum. Um-hum. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20297\">THERAPIST: You know where you say, I don\u2019t like this. Or I\u2019m not happy with this particular thing. Or I miss the physical intimacy. And what is the consequence? What, she doesn\u2019t speak to you? Or she says nasty things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20299\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B\">THERAPIST: I mean you are already deeply hurt, don\u2019t trust. The force field is still up. One act does not bring the force field down. It doesn\u2019t actually make you more vulnerable. It actually makes you more powerful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that \u2013 I think that that\u2019s the experience that I had. It think that I do feel that. I think that I do you know, even though I may not be using the language that I think that it was a powerful experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A1\">CLIENT: I do feel empowered to continue to do those kind of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A5\">CLIENT: And to recognize not only within the context of my marriage, but it\u2019s like oh, shit yeah. You know you just do this everywhere don\u2019t you. Just look at that. Oh, would you look at that. (chuckle) There you go again. Isn\u2019t that kind of funny. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A7\">So I think that I\u2019m you know, I\u2019m starting to be able to see that. And I think that the way that I\u2019m beginning to see that is maybe with just kind of a sense of humor about it almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A9\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AB\">CLIENT: You know it\u2019s like you know, oh, there you go again. Isn\u2019t that funny. You know so it\u2019s like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AD\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s humor for you, you\u2019re not poking fun at yourself? You\u2019re not making fun or damning yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AF\">CLIENT: No, no, no, no. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really not that feeling. It\u2019s more of like oh, I caught you. You tried to do it there, but I caught you. You know it\u2019s kind of \u2013 that kind of feeling. Like almost like you know, my dog who you know I tell her to sit in the corner. And you know I\u2019m doing the dishes or something and <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202B31\">she\u2019ll \u2013 she\u2019ll wait and then it\u2019s like she slowly starts to move. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B5\">THERAPIST: (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like no. No, it\u2019s like I caught you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B9\">THERAPIST: I see you, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BB\">CLIENT: I see you. So it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s that kind of thing. It\u2019s like oh, I see what\u2019s going on here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BF\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s more of that recognition. And if there\u2019s a sense of humor about it, it\u2019s more of a sense of a smile of like aah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C3\">CLIENT: Awareness, recognizing. Okay, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C5\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C7\">CLIENT: And there\u2019s where the empowerment is, you know. The awareness is powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Because you\u2019re changing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CD\">THERAPIST: But I think that you know, if it should move to damning or blaming or shaming yourself, remember, there are some really good reasons you \u2013 you began to live your life that way. There always are. Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CF\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D1\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s some really good reasons why we develop the coping skills that we do, right. Even when they stop making sense for us to do. So at some point in time that was functional and served a good value for you. It stopped and you don\u2019t have to do it anymore. But you know, you always have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202D11\">honor and understand why. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N202D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D3\">So I hope that \u2013 I mean and you have a sense of why, you know, but I think that sometimes we develop around these ways of being and then you know, but you can change it. But you have to \u2013 you have to respect the why did you do it in the first place. Instead of \u2013 and you try to have to kind of take a <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202D31\">step back a little bit and look at it and say well why did I begin to live this way? What was happening? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D7\">THERAPIST: As opposed to going what the hell? And what\u2019s wrong with you? And no. Because then you never really understand or respect why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DB\">THERAPIST: And then recognize well, you don\u2019t have to do that anymore. You don\u2019t have to be that anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202DF\">THERAPIST: You get to choose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E1\">CLIENT: Yeah. No I think \u2013 I think I get that you know. I \u2013 I\u2019m not necessarily sure if I\u2019m so much, that I feel like I necessarily have the energy right now to, well maybe I could. But I\u2019m like (pause) you know I\u2019m okay with just being able to say yeah. You know there was a reason why this happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202E11\">in the past. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E3\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E5\">CLIENT: I can let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E7\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202E9\">CLIENT: Really. You know it\u2019s like I get that. I get the fact that it\u2019s habitual patterns. And I\u2019ve just been you know doing the same kind of thing, it\u2019s like I just need to come to that place and like stop it. You can stop this now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EB\">THERAPIST: I wish you would have empathy for yourself for the why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202ED\">CLIENT: (deep breath) I\u2019m \u2013 okay. So it sounds like \u2013 it sounds to you like I\u2019m not empathetic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202EF\">THERAPIST: To you. For the why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F1\">CLIENT: No I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F3\">THERAPIST: Deeply \u2013 I\u2019m going to make up a word here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F7\">THERAPIST: Caringly empathetic as to the why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F9\">CLIENT: I will sit with that. I \u2013 I think that \u2013 I would say that I \u2013 I think that I feel empathetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FB\">THERAPIST: Have you forgiven yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FD\">CLIENT: Hum, that\u2019s a good question. That probably \u2013 probably not. I think that \u2013 yeah. If \u2013 if I could answer that one quickly or honestly, yeah. The fact that I can\u2019t, says something to the fact that yeah, probably not there yet you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FF\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20301\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I\u2019ll sit with that some more. I think that that could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20303\">THERAPIST: Seamus what are you feeling right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20305\">CLIENT: (deep breath) I think that you know it\u2019s just kind of an endorsement of \u2013 of some empowerment. You know I do feel that \u2013 yeah. Even though I may not be onboard necessarily being able to see it 100 percent yet, it\u2019s like I trust the fact that you\u2019re able to hold it for me. (chuckle) For a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203051\">bit. (laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20307\">THERAPIST: How very abdiculatious of you. (laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20309\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030D\">CLIENT: So yeah. Just yeah, hanging on to that for a little bit. Or holding it out there for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20311\">CLIENT: Let me \u2013 let me \u2013 so it feels like \u2013 yeah, let me try this one on this week. You know it\u2019s like I\u2019ll put that on and kind of wear that and see what it feels like. But \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20313\">THERAPIST: Which parts will you wear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20315\">CLIENT: Well I think that I feel like sitting with \u2013 sitting with the forgiveness piece. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20317\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20319\">CLIENT: (pause) You know and I feel like the \u2013 the other two by four to the head was like oh, do you like your wife? That\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure where to go with that, but it\u2019s like, oh, that was an incredibly uncomfortable question, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20318-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20318-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031D\">CLIENT: Kind of going with that.

I want to be respectful of the pace. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032D\">CLIENT: Oh thanks. No I think that (pause) I think to a \u2013 to some degree, you know it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been the kind of thing where I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to get to this place, you know and it\u2019s like \u2013 so just having \u2013 having somebody kind of help channel that and move it, that feels helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032F\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20331\">CLIENT: You know it\u2019s like oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20333\">THERAPIST: Because you came in, it seemed like pretty ready, pretty open you know. And so I\u2019m \u2013 I know I\u2019m saying some pretty blunt, direct things, you know. But I\u2019m sort of using our earlier discussion about you know, I guess the idea of your truth right, being you know seen \u2013 seeing you, hearing you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203331\">your wants, your needs without the distraction of \u2013 I don\u2019t have to consider your wife\u2019s needs in here, right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20335\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20337\">THERAPIST: And I don\u2019t have to consider your kids. I have to consider what those mean to you. But I\u2019m hoping that this can be a place where for an hour a week, you don\u2019t have to consider what it has to sound like when you say it out there. You can just say it or feel it or think it. And if I get it <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203371\">wrong, which you know, no problem, you say you got it wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20339\">And you get to sound \u2013 you get to hear yourself say directly, no that\u2019s not right. Or you got it wrong without having to repackage it in a way that you think I can or can\u2019t hear it. Because it\u2019s not going to change the fact that I like you. And I think you\u2019re a bright guy and enjoy working with you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203391\">Right, and I come from the other perspective where I just kind of say it. I don\u2019t really \u2013 really don\u2019t consider (laugh) \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2033B\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2033D\">THERAPIST: You know to \u2013 and that\u2019s sometimes a good thing, and sometimes not a good thing at all. But I just \u2013 because one of the things that I trust is, if I say it or do it wrong either in my personal life, or as a therapist, and it\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to \u2013 trying to hurt people in any way, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2033D1\">if I say it or do it wrong, I trust that the relationship I form, there will be some repair. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2033F\">So if I say Seamus, how did you hear what I said and you say you know what, I didn\u2019t like that. Or that hurt or you have a facial expression. I trust that there will be a repair in the relationship. So I\u2019m not overly concerned with how I say things. I try to say things in a sensitive way. But I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2033F1\">just say it you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20341\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20343\">THERAPIST: And so in some ways, I hope that\u2019s helpful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20345\">CLIENT: Well if nothing else, it\u2019s some modeling because I didn\u2019t grow up in that situation. You know so I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t have very many positive role models on how one you know, effectively just says it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20347\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well we\u2019ll see how effective it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20346-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20346-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561254\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20349\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2034B\">THERAPIST: But \u2013 but if not I certainly trust (laugh) I do trust that you\u2019re going to tell me.
