[00:03:55.23] [inaudible] (pause) Yesterday I said some things that, I don't know, like invited you to put yourself in my hands, which I think was my effort to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">reassure myself and reassure you, like you don't ever have to worry about being late for me. You don't need permission to be late. You don't need my permission. Why would I say that? It wasn't a pure sentiment. [00:05:08.17] I mean it felt pure at the time but I don't think it was. And then telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">you that it's okay with me if you aren't feeling that intimate [ph] [inaudible] Also clearly not that true. I mean it's okay with me but it's hard. And also I was thinking yesterday [inaudible] (pause) use all just a lot of energy around being worried or something like worried. [00:06:36.17] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it's hard for you to think about how much my maybe not being as sort of [inaudible] little receptive or engaged or something. It's hard for you to think about how big a deal that is, and so instead you try to manage it by taking care of me or [inaudible] You'd rather just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">kind of solve it than think about it.

Okay, so maybe I was trying to [inaudible] (laughs) Well it's not really fair to you for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">care so much. (pause) Because it's entirely fair to. (laughs) Do you know what I mean though? [00:09:44.03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I think [inaudible] is or what you're trying to say is that it feels as though to you I thought you were making an unreasonable demand on me too, in a way that sort of feels insistent that I'm feeling 100% of something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: No. I think just by giving it so much attention and space while maybe it's not at all what you want to focus on or think is important to focus on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Well, I think you were talking about doing that because it feels like you're making a demand on me, both in focusing on it and in what you want, which may be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, or for you to talk about it with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Talk about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: [inaudible] Both of those things would make me feel not included, [ph] your being better or your talking about it. [ph]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: And that's what your focus is on, that seems like a big affair to me. [00:12:11.08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: But then again you asked for it. We asked for it. We created it. Right? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I think you'll try to find a way into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but there's only so long that I feel bad about it because it's like well, this is what this whole thing is about, and if you're willing to work with me, this is part of working with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Again, I feel like you're I think you should feel bad about it or I think it's unfair or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe I think that you wish that I would talk about something else.

Are you going to ignore it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: You mean that I'm not going to give you a straight answer on that one? No, I'm not going to give you a straight answer on that one. I mean I had an interpretive thought about it which I said but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I didn't sleep well last night because [inaudible] thought that I was worried. [00:15:09.04] I had some kind of performance anxiety about coming here. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you really worry a lot about my not being able to be here for you in the way that I usually am, and you very quickly and mostly unconsciously sort of shift responsibility for doing that back onto yourself, and feel responsible for me managing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Whose responsibility should it be? [00:17:02.19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well you changed the nature of the problem, I think, in part not to see how it's affecting you. In other words you switch into feeling like you have to be performing, worried about whether you're going to be performing enough, well enough, to keep me here and engaged because you're worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">and end up being disturbed if I'm not feeling well or up to snuff are harder to sort of stay with I think. So that your attention moves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Well I guess it's hard to stay with it because I don't know exactly what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: What pops into your head? [00:18:33.29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: [inaudible] you haven't been well and [inaudible] going through all this week, Monday, Tuesday. [ph] That pops into my head. You were tired on Monday. [ph] What also pops into my head is [inaudible] that it's not very nice to react with me because you're doing the best you can. What exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">do I expect you to do? And also it's really not that big of a deal, and it seems like a bigger deal than it is, to me. So it's like this second guessing. And also just give the guy a break. [00:20:42.15] I want that. I don't want to yeah, I don't want it to be as big a deal as it is. And [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">this happens when [inaudible] so it feels familiar and it feels frustrating that [inaudible] and possibly all the momentum that I feel is maybe more coming from the past than dealing with what's actually happening here, which is not that big a deal. But my dad getting sick on a couple of occasions and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200453\">then getting alcohol poisoning were a big deal. [00:22:00.02] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] you feel sort of guilty and ashamed. You feel like it's a big deal [inaudible] so I think to feel angry or frustrated with me about it, there are those feelings in themselves, and then there's the kind of reacting to them, which as I said I think is one of shame and guilt. [00:25:05.05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Well also like, I don't know, it's kind of like a tease or something, like you're teasing me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well it just like makes it really hard not to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Like mentioning that I'm not feeling well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, like wondering what that (pause) and no, not so much mentioning it but I don't know, sort of like I have this thing and it's going to affect you and I'm going to shroud it in this veiled mystery. It feels like that. [00:26:33.07] I don't think that's what that (pause) I think that's maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">more what feels important about it, is I'm not included [inaudible] excluded.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559883\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Like only included enough to let you know that you're included.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: And maybe that's how I feel always when people are [inaudible] And maybe that's how I feel people change in their relationship to me when I'm [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: That I'm excluding them or they're excluded. That was a nice interpretation. [00:28:20.21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Well that happens quite a lot between you and me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Your being in pain and excluding me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] unconscious but when you sort of refer to having a hard time, say, between sessions or how upset you're feeling or kind of disoriented or overwhelmed. I don't think it's that you consciously think about it and consciously decide not to tell me about it or talk about it but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Talk about it more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah, with me, but you sort of allude to feeling those ways. But then having a that's [inaudible] a hard time talking about it here. [00:29:42.29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: More than just bringing it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Which is [inaudible] bringing it up and then not talking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I'm trying to think if there was some moment yesterday where I felt like you I was like [inaudible] or I wanted to say something and I felt like you weren't going to get it. I don't remember what it is but I wonder if that's part of it. Also, I don't get it [inaudible] hard for me to say something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">about [inaudible] I don't get. [00:31:18.11] There isn't enough confidence behind it or something. Do you remember that session when it became clear that it was upsetting to me that you weren't acknowledging how much time my thoughts about you take up and how nice that felt to realize that? I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">there's something like that getting in the way but I don't know what it is. (pause) [inaudible] demonstrated more knowledge about how to do [ph] things like creep into my mind in really small and everyday ways. And maybe if I demonstrated more willingness to talk about those small and everyday ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D3\">it would be easier to break it down into [inaudible] parts instead of [inaudible] that might push me around. [00:34:35.27] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: All right, well I'm going to start out being slightly didactic but I have a point that I'm headed towards that requires that. So [inaudible] put, there's conscious anxiety and there's unconscious anxiety. Conscious anxiety is when you know you're anxious. [00:36:09.15] When you're anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">your palms get sweaty, you feel butterflies, you feel extensive worry; it's pretty clear. Unconscious anxiety's more subtle. So it could be more like your mind going blank before a task or sort of forgetting something that has an emotional charge to it, like it upsets [ph] your mind or you realize you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">avoided it or avoided thinking about it. In those instances you might not even necessarily be aware that you're anxious but you can see the affects, and when you look at it retrospectively it's pretty clear that you're anxious. So I think you feel or I think you [inaudible] considerable unconscious <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F3\">anxiety around talking about certain bad feelings. [inaudible] But clearly also in your mind. [00:37:32.10] And I think that's probably because it [inaudible] that's really not okay about doing that, like sharing and connecting with people around things that feel really bad and especially that you feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F4\">shouldn't be making you feel so bad or that feel kind of demeaning, as though they were [inaudible] on your being sort of needy or dependent or something that can feel like mean or petty or something like that. I think when you feel things like that it's kind of like a smoke bomb goes off in your mind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F5\">or something of anxiety that you're not aware of, and then it becomes very difficult to know what to say, how you feel, where you're coming from, how to articulate what's going on clearly. [00:38:53.26] I mean to yourself as much as, say, to me. And I think that experience itself is really quite disturbing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F6\">and disorienting for you, and frustrating. (pause) Yeah, and I think it was triggered partly today by and yesterday by my not feeling it was not [ph] and sort of [inaudible] you say saying my saying that but not really any more than that. Because I think it probably did feel to you like I wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F7\">having an experience of this sort that you have. [00:40:28.17]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559883\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: You weren't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I was.
