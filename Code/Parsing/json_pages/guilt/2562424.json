[Pause] So yes, so Vicki is, she has this board exam for dental school or whatever. So yes, she asked me on Wednesday to go to Delaware and kind of be screened as a possible patient. I\u2019m sure I have some kind of, I don\u2019t need to pretend. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">going to go do just because the board exam is actually here in Philadelphia and so it\u2019s just kind of a lot to have patients from Delaware come up here to Philadelphia. So it\u2019s got to be later plus it\u2019s, whatever, a free checkup so yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: That means that she would be working on you though in the exam?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Potentially, yes, if something\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: If there is something to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Which is a little weird I think. I don\u2019t know; it\u2019ll be all right. She said she\u2019s good but yes. [Pause] I assume that I guess I\u2019m feeling a little bit anxious, a little weird because I\u2019ve kind of been, just a lot of last minute kind of I was trying to get a shipment off of samples today <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">and then it was actually Tanya needed my help today so with an experiment and to get (ph) along. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So then I pushed that back to yesterday and was negotiating with the company that I always have problems with because Lina had signed. And then of course a meeting pops up on Tuesday and right in the middle of the day they contact me and [inaudible at 00:04:40]. So I\u2019m a little bit worried about getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">everything done for this and I don\u2019t know and [inaudible at 00:05:10].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I guess, I don\u2019t know. On Friday Paula and I was kind of checking out the new schedule. Monday and Tuesday. I don\u2019t know I guess I was getting, I don\u2019t know it just seemed that I\u2019m the one who was going to be just squeezed or [maybe an exception] (ph) over responsibility but I don\u2019t know. And, yes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">and I guess I already kind of get that from other people in terms of I rarely push other people around. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You may have felt that very slightly with me with Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Maybe. I feel like I think I do that a lot with like my friends are kind of people in my life I feel guilty. I need to do things better and I\u2019m kind of changing myself for people, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So in a way sort of the squeezing is going to kind of go one way or the other. Either on Wednesday you\u2019ll feel a little guilty for canceling or you\u2019ll feel a little pressure from me that you\u2019re supposed to come in or something? Like there\u2019s somebody squeezing somebody a little bit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right or I guess it\u2019s more [inaudible at 00:09:52] work and I have to take a bus there and I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just not, I\u2019m okay with doing that but it\u2019s kind of I\u2019m not something I\u2019m excited for. And I\u2019m kind of, I don\u2019t know, and I feel like the favor wouldn\u2019t be directly returned or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">like that. But I feel like I\u2019m just kind of more open or kind of [pause] or trying to be more flexible or something like that and I\u2019d like to go home. Like [inaudible at 00:11:16] is always so busy and most times, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">It\u2019s kind of, I don\u2019t know, I want to help or I want to part (ph) not with just Vicki but with the other girls in the lab. But then I always get a little strange or I guess worried or something, I don\u2019t know and kind of I don\u2019t want to do it anymore or I feel <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562424\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What do you mean worried? I imagine you say strange because you feel like you\u2019re getting kind of pushed too far with the other things you have to do but I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referring to with worried. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Just kind of changing my schedule and worrying about not doing this for this person or now this is a new responsibility that also I need to keep tabs on and kind of think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Like sort of the whole thing just makes you anxious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: I think your feeling might be that the other person won\u2019t understand or won\u2019t be understanding about constraints you have. And I mean sometimes you may be right; I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re wrong but I think it probably in a pretty general way feels that way to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. Or I think, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of guilty for feeling anxious or kind of, because doing this kind of thing next to doing something kind of I thought should be aware or kind of responsible for my time but instead of that I was feeling anxious. And I can guess I was feeling that way <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">because it\u2019s not like a commitment just I\u2019m aware I should just silence it and kind of suffer through it. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I don\u2019t know. So I guess I just kind of feel like I\u2019m not doing enough to kind of handle everything or kind of and not be so stressed out or kind of get to the point where I don\u2019t want to do anything or be kind of upset at everyone or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: And I might be wrong here, I may sort of misunderstand that I think where you\u2019re coming from a little bit, but I wonder if you\u2019re sort of at the moment in a little bit of a kind of retreat. What I have in mind is that on one hand I think you\u2019re saying and sometimes I\u2019m saying people kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">of impose on you and you want to help but it can also be difficult with the other things you have to do. And other things that first the other person may not reciprocate and second they might not be that understanding of the other things you have going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">So those in a way are criticisms or I guess frustrations that you have about how this can come to seem one-sided at times or be one-sided at times. And then I think you go to how actually then the whole thing makes you kind of anxious. I believe it does, and then you feel kind of guilty about feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">anxious, which I understand to mean that you feel bad that you\u2019re anxious like you shouldn\u2019t be, you should just be able to handle this better and keep on top of yourself better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">So the retreat I have in mind is I think it makes you more anxious as you\u2019re talking here to feel kind of critical or frustrated with the other person. I think you feel maybe a little worried or a little bad about that. And I think that\u2019s part of the reason you go from talking about that to talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">about feeling like oh you feel guilty for being anxious about all of this. Not that I\u2019m skeptical that that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s more like I think you may have moved there a little bit to something that\u2019s a little more comfortable to talk about, although still unpleasant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">You might be worried about my judgment of you or maybe your own sense of guilt for feeling frustrated or critical with the one-sidedness you\u2019re referring to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562424\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I guess. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I\u2019m just trying to think. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I guess another way to say it is it could feel like I\u2019m not necessarily going to be all that understanding either of how when you\u2019ve got four or five different people asking you to do things. And Vicki\u2019s asking you to do those things that\u2019ll require at least a day upfront and maybe more time <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">later that and you want to help and at the same time feel a bit frustrated that I\u2019m kind of sure she would do the same; she might say she\u2019s too busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Well I guess, oh yes we had discussed me coming last week. And then over the weekend I tried to get in touch with her to ask is this time okay to come and are you looking at the best place. I couldn\u2019t get her on the phone. So and actually I was [inaudible at 00:26:43] replying. And so yes, last <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">night I was angry, angry because I don\u2019t know, I felt I was doing this for her. I don\u2019t, I have things to do; I don\u2019t necessarily have to go. Then and now it\u2019s going to be sad she can\u2019t text me back or kind of talk to me for five minutes just to go logistics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">And I don\u2019t know, just kind of pick away at her, her behavior and kind of her faults or whatever. And then, well then I keep telling myself oh I shouldn\u2019t burn any bridges or get angry or I don\u2019t know because [they\u2019re well managed] (ph) and so they\u2019ll say well I\u2019m just going to say I\u2019m not coming because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">this is ridiculous. But then I don\u2019t know I say just wait or it\u2019ll be okay. Then, yes, so then she texted me back saying that\u2019s fine or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">So, I don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t know it\u2019s always kind of [pause] just at work people push me to do things and if it doesn\u2019t work out then it\u2019s always my fault or kind of I feel blank or whatever just because like what always happens is for the shipment of samples [inaudible at 00:28:51] and then this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">input of numbered cells and 20,000 people come to me I have 12,000 and will it work. And I say well, I mean it has worked at 12,000 but it doesn\u2019t always work; it\u2019s a 50-50 chance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">And then they say well I killed 20 mice and spent so many hours doing this I can\u2019t do it anymore, hurry. We\u2019ll try but then I\u2019m held to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well I mean this is 75% you work really hard, so much harder she doesn\u2019t have to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, the people and then they say well this starts in sampled work and I don\u2019t really have a bunch of control over I simply extract it and then it goes through a lot of [inaudible at 00:29:43] and company, it goes through a lot of other processes. But as far as responsibilities it\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">of if it works. So then I feel bad or maybe I\u2019m not doing something right or I don\u2019t know, I just kind of hate the interactions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">And every kind of person, some people are fine. They say samples, lists of samples. And some people give me guilt trips of how long these took or these are so special samples and I say well I have hundreds to do; sorry I\u2019ll do my best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Because they\u2019re kind of putting all this stuff that really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Right. [Pause] But I guess it kind of feels indulgent or kind of I feel bad for kind of complaining about it or I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, yes to me it seems like other people are kind of more willing to talk about themselves or talk about problems at work or feeling frustrated but to me it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">feels like I don\u2019t want to do it or I just don\u2019t want to get into it or it feels, yes I kind of just feel guilty. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562424\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you feel like you\u2019re imposing on me in the way that people at work are imposing on you. Or like it reflects on the same way on you as at work, what you\u2019re talking about reflects on the people who are complaining to you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes.

And they\u2019re all worked up about whether their samples are <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">going to work and their experiments probably haven\u2019t gone the way they wanted to go ideally and which is why they don\u2019t have enough stuff and they\u2019re frustrated about that, and that what they\u2019re taking out on you in a way comes from all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any more your fault but I get that in a sense maybe more that you do have moments of being kind of feeling a little bad for them that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yes.
