Come on in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(Pause): [00:01:15 00:01:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(Pause): [00:01:34 00:02:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking of what\u2019s on my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(Pause): [00:02:39 00:03:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I guess I was trying to tell myself or ask why I get so like influenced by other people in the sense that it becomes really debilitating at a point because. I guess I\u2019ve always been like that with people and have observed that about me. I don\u2019t know, I just get swayed by people and that\u2019s true <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">in a lot of respects, like it happens very intensely with I guess, boyfriends. And then it also happens like just generally with like feeling like I am thinking about or asking people, what do you do and you know? And why do you do it and I think about, like recently, I guess, think about what gives <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">a person their confidence and like their happiness and all that. I wonder if it\u2019s because I feel so lost so much that I look to other people to provide structure \u2013 maybe not structure but meaning or where to look for meaning. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">But I was just feeling like I should stop that (laughs) because I had jobs and when I had jobs it was like I\u2019m dying to write and now that I\u2019ve given myself the time to write I\u2019m spending a lot of it just worrying about whether I\u2019m just wasting my time or why am I not heading out to work in the morning <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">like everyone else, you know? Why am I not in the race to make money or watch out for myself, my future? And I\u2019m like, but I wanted this time to write so I should just make the most of it and live in that moment instead of worrying about the future, at least for a bit. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve been applying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">for random jobs and not really getting anything because I thought I need another part time job or maybe even a full time one. I don\u2019t know, because I want to figure out my living situation \u2013 living on my own or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So I guess I\u2019ll be seeing my old friend also. Because over the summer she\u2019s just saved. She had to have a lot of money because she moved out of her old apartment and this morning I also saw that she is \u2013 she\u2019d written out her own rent check which hasn\u2019t happened in a long time. And I was surprised by <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">that and felt kind of odd about it. (Laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Why? What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Well, it was just like a mixture \u2013 like, oh, am I not needed? And I was like, oh, I didn\u2019t really mean to yell and scream at her and give her so much attitude and feel like, oh God, I have this burden because she wrote her own rent check and then I was also feeling a little like relaxed you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">know, like she can take care of herself. (Laughs). Okay. Scary also. But I guess I had more negative, slightly more negative emotions than positive ones which is so stupid because I should be jumping up and down and saying, yaw! I don\u2019t have to worry about my mom. But I do and she was like, he can pay <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">the next one. But at least for these three months she hasn\u2019t even asked me for any money, you know? So that should make me feel good, but instead I\u2019m like should I be worried about this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">(Pause): [00:08:18 00:08:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Things have been kind of weird as they always are, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(Pause): [00:08:35 00:08:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: So it gives me a little bit of hope or comfort that things won\u2019t be as scary as I actually think that they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560173\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And how did you think they\u2019d be scary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m scared all the bloody time. It\u2019s just like, why am I scared? I have to actually slow down and think about it and try and look at it in the face and like why am I afraid of this? Let\u2019s look at it. I\u2019m learning to do that. I guess I\u2019ve been doing things that I shouldn\u2019t be doing (laughs) and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">that\u2019s why I\u2019m scared, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: You\u2019re going to judge me on things that I tell you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Do I judge you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: (Unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: To, I guess, to help me. (Laughs) So I guess it\u2019s okay that you judge me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: How does my judging you help to help you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe you don\u2019t judge me, all right? Maybe I just feel judged. Maybe what you do is very different from my perception. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And I judge you because I don\u2019t like you or because I\u2019m a judgmental person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe you are a judgmental person. Everyone is judgmental.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well then that doesn\u2019t make me a judgmental person. It makes me like everybody else, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: (Laughs) That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">(Pause): [00:10:36 00:10:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Things will evolve, I guess. I don\u2019t know, but maybe I should also take some responsibility and plan or something like that, you know, be a little bit more rational and proactive. So \u2013 (laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to tell me what quote\/unquote stupid things you do, I was just curious about that aspect of your comment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Like I guess it\u2019s not stupid, it just kind of scares me a little bit but so you know, like there\u2019s so much, so many things happening, I feel overwhelmed a bit, I guess. So, I\u2019m not really processing a lot of things. I\u2019m just trying to compartmentalize them but at the same time life is also happening, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">you know. So, I don\u2019t know what thread to pick up on and what narrative to give it except saying that if I put myself in the center and then I would say that I\u2019m kind of confused but also looking for a path that is my own and not inspired by others or like not like I\u2019m usually, up until now, I\u2019ve been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">\u2013 I do two things I guess. I try \u2013 I think I try to just fit in and try to figure out, okay, where will I \u2013 I guess when you\u2019re looking for a job and you\u2019re graduate, that\u2019s the mode right? You see where you\u2019ll fit in, where your skills will match with what company and all that. So there is that side <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D3\">of me, but on the other side that wants to be, I don\u2019t know, independent, or I would like to use a very fancy word \u2013 trailblazer thing, you know. That\u2019s what I want to be. I want to do something different and lo and behold, I am doing it from some miracle in the sense that I\u2019ve quit jobs several times <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D4\">and now I\u2019m like taking all the necessary steps to do that, but then there are all these other complications as well and I just get scared that \u2013 am I sabotaging what is most important to me by either getting distracted and there are other things also. Like the thing with David over kind of always confused <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D5\">about each other. I guess mostly the confusion is mine. And we were talking about doing couples therapy and now he thinks \u2013 until recently he was like yeah let\u2019s do it. But I was just a bit confused or lost and not wanting to do it because I\u2019m like I\u2019m already doing therapy here and I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D6\">add this on. I don\u2019t know. So and then you know, I went to New York. When was that? I think, I don\u2019t know \u2013 was it cold? No it wasn\u2019t cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560173\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: In the spring sometime?

Maybe April. Yeah, probably April, because not in May and then I went to Nepal. Oh God, it feels like \u2013 anyways, and so that you said was kind of stupid and I agree. Like, well I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if I used the word \u201cstupid\u201d but okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Well, what did you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t remember how I described it but I wouldn\u2019t think I used to word \u201cstupid\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but maybe it was more like you get into messes, or something like that? What would you call that situation? I mean you don\u2019t remember your words from then, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Complicated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: You get into complications? (Laughs) Or, I complicate things? Why is that complicating \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: The reason I used the word complicated is that it is complicated. There are (unclear) motivations that you have for doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Or going there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yes. It\u2019s hard to characterize each one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) not called stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Hmm. I guess the less complicated way would have been to like break things off with David first, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s one way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which I guess is what I\u2019m trying to do now. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Well like so I met a guy (laughs) in \u2013 March? Yeah, probably around the same time and we were just casually hanging out and stuff and I guess we got intimate this weekend so now I have all this like guilt. (Laughs) So since then, well actually before that when I got back from Nepal I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">okay, I have to find my own place, you know, because I\u2019m basically living with David, you know? And seeing someone else while living with David is you know, wrong. On so many levels I feel like -. So step one \u2013 find a job. Step two look for a place. So I\u2019m still working on both of those because both <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">are seeming to be extremely hard to come by. (Laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m trying to open myself to the possibility of living with my mom because she\u2019s moved to Providence now so location-wise that is quite attractive and I just have to figure out the physical, the living arrangements to set up the place to my liking because she is very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">messy and I\u2019m kind of organized \u2013 not organized, but neat and esthetically need the place to look really nice \u2013 so I have to negotiate that with her. But instead of that freaking me out, it\u2019s actually not a little bit. I mean it is freaking me out but it\u2019s also like I\u2019m trying to \u2013 you know, like this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200872\">morning when she\u2019d written the rent check I felt very confident. Or I was telling myself this was comforting and you ought to feel it. So I am hoping that I will be pleasantly surprised because she has been living alone now for a year. So maybe she\u2019s become a little independent and it would be nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200873\">to kind of observe that or partake of that because it is nice, I think to live with someone who\u2019s you know, not leaning on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560173\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">Or maybe, that\u2019s not what I mean. What I mean is like, earlier living with her was somewhat painful because she was dependent and now that I\u2019m doing therapy, also, I\u2019ve talked about this with you, I\u2019m hoping my perspective has changed a little where I\u2019m seeing her as being an independent person \u2013 someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">who does not lean on me for money and if she does it doesn\u2019t seem like such an emotional burden or psychological burden, you know? And that I\u2019m not responsible all the time for her happiness or her sadness, you know? Because living with her \u2013 I think we talked about this, I felt so fused with her sorrows <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200892\">and her inabilities to do things. So fused that that became my identity and I was desperately wanting another one and I guess what I found in its place was an identity with David. That again, that also was kind of not acceptable to me because I kept feeling lower than him on so many levels. So I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200893\">like I would love an identity that was not fused with anyone. Informed by other people, mom, boyfriends, dad even (laughs), and friends, but I would like for them to give me some space, to be on the side like chapter three or four. Maybe the first two chapters would just be about me, you know? So that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200894\">is what I would like. (Laughs). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like there are things you can\u2019t tell me because you\u2019re afraid of my judging you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I\u2019m trying to get over that. See how quickly I told you? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: And what does my judging you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Well, like earlier with the Ohio thing you said something, I guess I didn\u2019t remember the exact words but I remembered my feeling of my reaction to what you\u2019d said so I guess that was like, \u2018oh God, I did something wrong. Why am I always doing wrong things? What\u2019s wrong with me, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: So that was coming from me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Well no. I\u2019m not saying \u2013 I\u2019m not putting you at fault. I\u2019m stepping up and taking responsibility for my own feelings. You might have meant \u201cA\u201d and I might have interpreted it as \u201cB\u201d or A plus X or something. That +X is my doing, my brain or whatever that converts your speech into a negative <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">emotion. I mean I just thought it would start worrying me to have to worry about what I\u2019m doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: How do you mean, \u201cworry about what you\u2019re doing\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Well, you know, it is kind of worrying. It\u2019s been weird because you know on the one hand I want to see this guy and on the other, I don\u2019t want to see him because it\u2019s like I\u2019m living with David and I haven\u2019t told him and I don\u2019t think I can and it feels wrong to do this to David.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">(Pause): [00:23:18 00:23:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s worrying. I get (unclear) all up and down this weekend and I\u2019m so happy, so happy, and then I\u2019m like scared, (laughs) worried and feeling very guilty. (Sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: When you do these things it\u2019s not about me. From what I understand about judgment, the way I see it, it\u2019s things that you\u2019re doing to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: What do you mean, these things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Like, you know, sort of going and seeing another man while you\u2019re living with David. Bearing that knowledge and feeling that sense of guilt is a lot of pain to bear.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560173\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well I\u2019m trying to change that. I\u2019m sleeping at my mom\u2019s place. And I\u2019m slowly trying to transition into living with her so I\u2019m hoping that I won\u2019t be living with David in the next few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Does he know you\u2019re moving out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Does he know \u2013 did you tell him why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I mean. There\u2019s all these things that I haven\u2019t processed and all these conflicting influences because when I came back from Nepal I told him that I am ready to get married in the next few months and have children but that married life would be a little stale physically, I guess. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">And he was like, no \u2013 that\u2019s not acceptable. What do I do about this? Because I love him and I respect him and I see myself fitting into his life like having kids with him. I still have all these doubts like can he be a good father? But I don\u2019t care because I think I\u2019ll just bring up the children. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">I saw that, I considered that possibility I guess because I\u2019d seen \u2013 this was like the Nepal influence where I \u2018d spent time with couples and women that I\u2019d admired, they now have two kids and you know they seem to live fairly independently of their husbands in the sense that they all live together <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD3\">but the husband goes off to work in the mornings, comes in the evenings and the woman has the whole day to herself to look after kids, do what she wants. I thought maybe that\u2019s what I want to do. But then the moment I got back to the U.S. and started hanging out with the women\u2019s organization that we <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD4\">started, they are all about \u2013 they are like western feminists and are like independence and explore \u2013 not explore but talk about your sexuality and this and that. And I\u2019m like wait a second, I don\u2019t want to get married to David because I\u2019m not really attracted to him physically. We are intimate because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD5\">I don\u2019t know, it seems to work, I guess, now. But it\u2019s not something that I look forward to or would like to initiate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: So then, how did you break up with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s been like happening over a year, right. So, he knows that I\u2019m totally confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: But I thought you said you\u2019re moving out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: So are you not breaking up with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I am. I guess what I said to him was that I need space to figure things out. So \u2013 I mean, I\u2019ve been looking for apartments since I got back and I haven\u2019t \u2013 (unclear). So I just thought I\u2019d be able to live with my mom. So I think it\u2019s kind of complicated. (Laughs) I thought I wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">see this guy until I find a place and have you know, kind of not seeing David for a while, but I guess that didn\u2019t happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You changed your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t have self-control. (Laughs) So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">(Pause): [00:28:41 00:28:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to have control, I guess. Trying to make a plan and prioritize but I guess I do worry, am I throwing away my priority? I mean, David. Staying with David was great because he, like he didn\u2019t ask, he doesn\u2019t ask for rent because it was such a tiny space anyways. I mean I could contribute <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">if I want to but I guess I had my mom\u2019s rent to pay so I didn\u2019t. And I wonder if that was using him because it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love him. I do love him and I do all his cooking and cleaning and (laughs). And living with him was kind of ideal in that sense because I didn\u2019t have to worry about money <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">and I had like a space just all to myself at least all day long. But I\u2019m wondering if that is not \u2013 if I should have my own space. At least the women in my organization are like, you really need a place of your own. (Laughs). I feel like yeah, that is the first order of business. But then like is there <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C13\">a cost\/benefit analysis here because should I turn off the (unclear) because then I can finish my project, you know. Finish my writing project.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560173\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: So would David be okay if you lived there as roommates and you dated other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. I guess he\u2019d be okay with us being roommates but probably not if I\u2019m seeing other people. We\u2019d be okay as roommates if I was not seeing people. (Laughs) And I could have done that but I was very attracted to this guy and he was like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, if you were roommates then you\u2019re not living as roommates if you cannot see other people. Because roommates can see other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: But not in our case because we\u2019ve been so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s because you wouldn\u2019t be roommates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t think David and I can be roommates. Because we\u2019ve been together for so long and last year also we were practically seeing each other every day, (laughs), almost. And we talked about getting married also. And it\u2019s just fused.

They\u2019d rather be alone than have to settle and you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: The problem is that no one can tell you that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re not living with David to know (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s one of the problems of asking other people, you know, sort of what they\u2019d do and emulating yourself after them is theoretically impossible because there are no two symmetric situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2012E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560173\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: Your attachment to David is just so complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: The two of you attachment together are so complicated. But there are ways in which when there are two things that are incompatible that you want your solution is to see just if you can get them both, even if they\u2019re incompatible. And so you strain the system \u2013 whether compromising yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201371\">or compromising other things to see if you can make that happen. And you\u2019re so focused on that you don\u2019t realize the negative effects of that strain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah. You said two incompatibilities. What \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it\u2019s two different people. You want two people at the same time who don\u2019t want to be in an open relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">THERAPIST: And so on that level. But I mean, even with David, you want someone sort of exciting and spontaneous and very structured and very \u2013 even to attributes in one person you want \u2013 but then you know, you want to be with David and you want to be with somebody else and the two of them \u2013 at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">David doesn\u2019t want you to be with somebody else. That\u2019s incompatible. You have to be with one or you have to be with the other. Or no one. And so then you strain the system. Oh what can I do, what can I say, how can I make things so that I can get both these things? But in the end you end up being so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F2\">much more hurt by that then having to deal with not getting some of what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">(Pause): [00:41:37 00:41:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">CLIENT: I guess I don\u2019t want to be so desperate and be like no I have to get this thing right away, you know? But whatever it is \u2013 physical, intimacy, or structure, you know. But I feel that way. I feel \u2013 I guess I feel more a need for structure than I feel for physical intimacy. I mean that can be <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201451\">put on the back burner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: But no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: But for how long? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: But you don\u2019t put it on the back burner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t.

Okay. I don\u2019t see the burner. I don\u2019t see what I can put on the back or on the front. I just \u2013 I guess that\u2019s what I do. I switch things around. Like the first of the month I stick with structure, cook that for a bit and then when something happens I put, yeah, I put physical intimacy <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201611\">on the front burner and then structure on the back. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">THERAPIST: But I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a burner that you actually have to dump the pot. I think there\u2019s really only one burner and so it\u2019s unclear what to do with the pot. So sometimes I think you say on an unconscious level \u2013 oh that pot doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s no pot. I\u2019ll go off with this (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201631\">pot and the pot emerges when you come back and you need somewhere to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s a game you play with yourself. A game \u2013 in quotes. I know it\u2019s very complicated. I don\u2019t mean to make it sound \u2013 I don\u2019t see it as manipulative.
