Of course, less than 24 hours before Stephanie was supposed to get on her flight and meet us there, her sister went into labor, so she had to cancel her whole trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So that was disappointing, and I was a little upset. But I got over it, and Leti and I had a lovely time over there and had a very nice birthday dinner out and whatever. Then when she left, I was alone for all of Sunday which was like kind of fine because I was hanging out at the pool at our first hotel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">But then I had to transfer to our second hotel because that was supposed to be like Stephanie and me\u2019s last night on beach area. It\u2019s not the best place to be like alone because it\u2019s just like tons of groups of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s mostly young people and it was the Super Bowl. I had a hard time, but it ended up fine. I got some dinner with myself. The room I had was like right on the pool level, like right opened up to the pool, and it was really nice and heated and nicely lit. So I took a nice solo night swim. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">Nobody else was there which was very nice. You know, just little things that like I couldn\u2019t have done if I was with somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So that was nice. Of course the whole time I grappled with well, do I want to move here? The whole thing I can\u2019t decide still. It\u2019s just the weather. Maybe it\u2019s that seasonal defective disorder or whatever affective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Affective, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Because I feel defective. (chuckles) That\u2019s what my mom says it is, and she\u2019s like \u201cYou really can\u2019t afford to move there, there\u2019s no jobs\u201d and blah blah blah. And she\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">It\u2019s just the weather is so much nicer, and like this is just awful. Then I came back kind of late on oh, and then Monday ended up fine because Betty [ph], my officemate, happened to be there at the same time. And so her and her mother picked me up in the afternoon, and we did a little bit of shopping <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">and had lunch, and we were on the same flight even. We were able to get seats together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: It was nice. And then took a cab home together because she lives down the block from me, you know, so that worked out nice. So it was only really one day alone, so it wasn\u2019t that bad. But it was disappointing not to have Stephanie there. I mean, obviously I understood, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: By all means. I started a journal which I\u2019ve been trying to be consistent about writing in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s been really good. I haven\u2019t done that for quite a while, and I forgot how kind of soothing it can be for me and that it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: pretty cathartic, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: But then when I got back, you know, on Tuesday I got back and kind of went straight to bed because by the time I got back, it was 9:30 and I had work the next morning. I got to work and no assistant and the first day of events and just running all over the place and doing two jobs. It just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">kind of threw me right back into like hating everything. It was a really busy week, then we had that snowstorm on Wednesday and so I ended up staying home, to work from home, whatever. My class started that I didn\u2019t really realize it was starting. I\u2019m taking this adult development class to get back into -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562318\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: the school thing. So that caught me off guard. So it\u2019s just like a really harried week. And then we have the museum silent auction -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: that was supposedly like my last thing with them -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: on Thursday. And I like had a big thing with Lucas during the day about like getting the bid sheets printed and like whatever, it\u2019s fine. I get there, the wife is there. I\u2019m just decided to just go about my business. Like I\u2019m just working with the people and trying to avoid doing things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">that Lucas is doing, trying to avoid working with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Trying to avoid being around him. His wife is helping out and volunteering. I spend the evening like trying to just talk to other people, talk to this guy that I have a nice rapport with. His name is Marvin that I\u2019m going to ask out. Or that I have asked out, like \u201cOh, if you want to grab <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">a drink\u201d and [he may be interested] so I was like flirting. You know, Aiden was there bartending. I was trying I was drinking some wine and getting a little tipsy, trying to avoid Lucas and the wife. There were a couple of moments where I was alone with her, and I kind of like felt like I had to make conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: But it was very much just like \u201cHow are things?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: And she\u2019s like \u201cOh, you know, no job\u201d and I was like \u201cGreat, oh it\u2019s a big adjustment\u201d and then like escape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: And every time I would talk to both of them, I tried to like make my eye contact even with both of them so that it wasn\u2019t like I was just talking to her husband. She\u2019s standing right there. It was very awkward. And then Lucas kept coming up to me. Like he would find ways to not like I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">be avoiding him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right. He was finding excuses to come over to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Like two or three times, I was standing with another person and he came in between us like \u201cHey guys, what\u2019s up?\u201d You know, like and I\u2019m like \u201cLucas, you could\u2019ve just walked up to us. This is very awkward and uncomfortable.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: And I think he was the one [that sucked]. Of course, when I started to get a little bit tipsy, I had a little bit of wine and then I started to kind of just like avoid him because I was angry. [Like I was just annoyed].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">But anyway, I wake up on Friday morning kind of feeling like maybe I can just go in and do my job. Maybe I can keep working with the museum and just like yeah, this week has been hard getting back into it and thirty and whatever, but you know and then I woke up late. I\u2019m on my way into work <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">late as a result. I don\u2019t know what happened. I think I must\u2019ve just been tired and the event and whatever. Woke up late.

Like that\u2019s what I felt like my whole world just crumbled down around me, and I wasn\u2019t even standing on anything, and I was like having an out-of-body experience and floating and just looking at this rubble of what the fuck is going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">I guess how he explains it was that they got home from the thing, like whatever. And then at bedtime, she was being really [tired and just going into] bed and he was like finally I\u2019m sure she even cried the whole night. I\u2019m sure he had just been like avoiding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: [I guess just asked her] and she said \u201cJust thinking\u201d and he said \u201cThinking about what?\u201d and she said \u201cProbably the same thing you are.\u201d Then he said that\u2019s when his heart started racing, and she looks over at him, and he was like silent, and she put her hand over his chest and felt that his <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">heart was racing. No, no. Before she felt his heart racing, I guess she had said \u201cDid you have a relationship with Trina?\u201d or \u201cWhat was your relationship with Trina?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: And then he proceeds to tell her that we did it twice, and that\u2019s all I need to know. That we did it twice, and it doesn\u2019t matter, and I can\u2019t message him, and we can\u2019t be friends. I can\u2019t talk to him and I can\u2019t call him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">And then he says so he prefaced it with \u201cDon\u2019t ask any questions.\u201d Then he says he explains kind of what happened and then I say and then he says \u201cWhat do you have questions about?\u201d And my first question was \u201cDid she cry?\u201d Like I don\u2019t know why. And then he was like \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">you that. Shut up. Fuck off. Like I don\u2019t give a fuck. I don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d And I was like \u201cHow are you going to tell me to ask a question and I ask a question, and then you say you don\u2019t give a fuck?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">So we continued to talk and apparently from what it sounds like, he was like \u201cIt happened twice and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d And she\u2019s like \u201cSo you want to talk about it again later because we\u2019re going to talk about it.\u201d And from what I understand, he was calling me from work and he\u2019s like \u201cI <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">don\u2019t know.

He\u2019s got so many issues that I can see from just everything. \u201cAnd then you don\u2019t talk about it? You get up and get dressed and go to work and call me? Like, what?

She matters to me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">And I\u2019m like crying and I was like crying, sobbing like \u201cI know that. Like to me she\u2019s mattered more than like -\u201d and he\u2019s like oh no, he said \u201cYou\u2019re not the victim.\u201d I was like \u201cI\u2019m not I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the victim\u201d even though obviously I am a little bit of a victim, but not really. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">he goes \u201cThen why are you crying like you are one?\u201d I was like \u201cI\u2019m not crying because I think I\u2019m a victim in this and whatever. I\u2019m crying because this is fucking upsetting and it involves me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: And he just told you that you didn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Basically. And then of course I\u2019m crying and I\u2019m like \u201cI know she\u2019s number one, and I know that you\u2019re number two. I don\u2019t even give a fuck about myself in this situation.\u201d Then he\u2019s like \u201cAlright, take it easy, buddy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">But then he started to like feel bad. But like no, you already just basically told me I\u2019m not human in this situation and it doesn\u2019t matter. Anything doesn\u2019t matter. It just matters her and her feelings and what she\u2019s and he\u2019s like \u201cDon\u2019t call me. I\u2019ll contact you.\u201d I was like \u201cDon\u2019t contact <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">me.\u201d And then I go \u201cI\u2019ll e-mail your father and let him know I\u2019m stepping down from the museum effective immediately.\u201d And he said \u201cWhat?\u201d and I was like \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You want to be friends and I\u2019m still going to be on the committee? Do you know how inappropriate that is?\u201d He was like \u201cI guess.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">So that was awful and the phone call just ended with him like \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch\u201d and I was like \u201cWhatever, best of luck.\u201d I told Samson and Mandy. They were both like texting me and calling me like \u201cAre you okay?\u201d and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry for not getting back to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s fine. I just figured if you had something, you would let me know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, no. I also I should have gotten back to you in any case. I actually ended up having to leave early on Friday with all this stuff going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But yeah, I should have written.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s why I got that because I texted you after I got that call too. [Perfect timing to have missed this appointment.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Anyway, and then I went home on Friday night. I think I went to bed really early. I like basically felt like I was just going through the motions on Friday. Like I felt numb, I just felt horrible. My mind was like rushing with guilt and shame and \u201cIs this my fault? Am I a home wrecker? Is she <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">going to leave him? I hope she doesn\u2019t leave him. Maybe she should leave him. Hopefully they can work it out. He\u2019s going to cheat on her with somebody else.\u201d Just all these things, you know, in my head all day, like about the whole situation. Feeling horrible about Stephanie. What if she goes there <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD2\">and what if you know, the whole thing. What if they get divorced and then Stephanie asked why they got divorced, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562318\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">I woke up on Saturday morning and was like shame-spiral and the first thing that I did was text Aiden and say \u201cListen, you told me if I was ever going to tell Stephanie to tell you ahead of time, and I\u2019m telling her so I\u2019m just going to let you know I\u2019m telling her because this is awful.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Okay -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Aiden -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Aiden knew?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Oh, I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Oh, you didn\u2019t? Oh no, Aiden has known the whole time.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019m pretty sure I did not know that.

So he knew but nobody told Stephanie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Correct. It was this whole thing that he was mad at me because he was now keeping this lie from his girlfriend. So he said \u201cJust make sure whenever you plan to tell her, you tell me ahead of time so she doesn\u2019t call me and like \u2018what the fuck.\u2019\u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">And then he texted me back and he was like \u201cI think that you\u2019ll feel better. I\u2019m sure everything will be fine. I almost told her myself last night, but I just couldn\u2019t do it so I\u2019m glad to hear this.\u201d And I think he must\u2019ve almost told her because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Lucas must have told -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Told Aiden that Michelle [ph] knows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: That Michelle [ph] found out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I was thinking because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Michelle [ph] found out from seeing the two of you together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. So basically I\u2019m sorry, I left that part out. So she basically told him that she knew, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: And he gave it away because she asked him about it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: and then his heart started racing and he went silent and got all choked up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: He can\u2019t lie. Apparently he can [via Skype]. And I mean, yeah, it makes sense. Like not only is she a woman and we know stuff, but when you\u2019re not you know, the same as like a blind person, they can hear and smell and taste a little bit better, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">You know, she can\u2019t understand the language as much so reading tone, body language and eye contact probably becomes a lot easier. That, you know, probably has something to do with it. She\u2019s observing a lot. You observe a lot more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: So anyway, that\u2019s how she knew. Aiden must have figured it out or came home and they were fighting or who knows, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: So I told Stephanie. I texted her and I was like \u201cWe need to meet up\u201d and we met up and she\u2019s like \u201cOkay, it\u2019s just going to take a while for me to process this.\u201d She\u2019s like \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to be my friend\u201d or whatever but just feels let down and this whole year and the whole thing. She just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201051\">has to kind of take some time to get over it which makes sense. I\u2019m just hoping she doesn\u2019t try to like hold it over my head, like punish me.

Not Stephanie, his wife.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: And he unfriended me on Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t heard from him. You know, I was asking Stephanie, I was like \u201cSo how do we play this? Like if he tries to call me or text me, like whether it\u2019s to check in on me or to tell me they\u2019re not breaking up or tell me they are breaking up or whatever.\u201d She\u2019s like \u201cYou go silent. You just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201111\">don\u2019t answer. You\u2019re done.\u201d And I think that\u2019s right.

And she said the same thing. She\u2019s like \u201cHe told you that you don\u2019t matter, so you\u2019re not human to him. So you can do whatever the fuck you want and thank God you\u2019re finally telling me. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">suck for not telling me before, but fuck him.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">CLIENT: \u201cFor me, you\u2019re number one, Aiden is number two, and they can go fuck themselves.\u201d Because I told her how he said \u201cShe\u2019s number one, I\u2019m number two, and you guys can go fuck yourselves.\u201d So that was nice to know that I have her support there, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: We decided there\u2019s no reason why or how Lucas there\u2019s no reason why Lucas should know that she knows. Like there\u2019s no reason to specifically tell him. If he finds out, I don\u2019t care because obviously I\u2019m nothing, so who cares who I told. So he does find out, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Another reason would be that you [are] nothing and you get to take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Well, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: By doing things like, you know, telling one of your best friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah.

This is not your fault. I created this, and I pulled you into this, and now you\u2019re in this because of me.\u201d But like, so? I mean, it doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat me like shit.

Or if she does, then I think she\u2019s stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.

I think well, because I\u2019ve been on the other end of finding out the person that you thought was faithful was not being faithful. And I think just that feeling of having caught that for somebody or having been a part of what might be that same feeling for another woman was really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A71\">really heart-wrenching for me and really guilt-provoking and really just horrible. And I think I also was worried that I was causing a divorce, that it would cause a divorce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">I think also just the understanding that it meant I can really never talk to or see Lucas again was also very painful. But there was really a very overwhelming feeling of just like, I have to get out of this city. Like I have to move. I can\u2019t believe that this is horrifying. It\u2019s mortifying. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB1\">just horrible. Like how can I stay here if anybody knows that I did this? What if she ever sees me again? I can never look in her eyes you know, just yeah, like I was in huge trouble. (pause) And I think it was the combination of just, you know, feeling sad that I was making somebody feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB2\">perhaps I felt last year.

And Aiden is going to hate me if I cause a divorce. You know, Stephanie is going to question why I can never be around them again, and I have to tell her. And it really did feel like my whole world was just like, bleh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Imploding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It definitely took some time for me to kind of that\u2019s why Friday I think was so difficult for me because I just I felt very implicated. I felt very much at fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">CLIENT: Like I did this.

I mean, now that it seems like she may be staying or, you know, from what Aiden Stephanie said that Aiden said they didn\u2019t hang [with her] on Saturday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">They were just at their they were hanging out at their friend\u2019s house, Phillip\u2019s house, but that from what Aiden made a comment, something like \u201cI think everybody is just trying to move on.\u201d And so now that I kind of feel like maybe their marriage isn\u2019t ending, I feel less at fault, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">CLIENT: And kind of like eh, it\u2019s their problem now, then.

But the whole thing made me uncomfortable, and it was just like you\u2019re making even more of a point than when you were telling me you loved me <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202331\">that you shouldn\u2019t be married to this woman. Like, you don\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t know you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">CLIENT: (pause) And then I feel bad that I start to feel sorry for him, like I have before. Sorry for him that he ended up in this situation where he\u2019s married to this person that he probably shouldn\u2019t be. Sorry for him that now he\u2019s maybe going to have a guilt trip his whole life or have to feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202391\">he\u2019s really, you know, making up for this his entire life which is a horrible thing to feel, I think. Even though he you know, it\u2019s backwards. It\u2019s very convoluted, all of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe there\u2019s a way a lot of it is pretty consistent. I mean, maybe the way you tend to feel is maybe in various ways, you work really hard to kind of let him off the hook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">THERAPIST: And to put the problems on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">THERAPIST: It seems like that\u2019s what -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">CLIENT: No, I think that\u2019s fair to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20249\">THERAPIST: part of what\u2019s going on. (pause) And I think it actually probably fits in pretty closely with something that we\u2019ve talked about. I think probably a big reason that you do that is to avoid feeling disappointed in him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024B\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s much better to make it you fucking up and at fault and this, that and the other thing, pathetic and he\u2019s sort of whatever, than to be disappointed in another guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20251\">THERAPIST: Which I think is what you are pretty damn certain is going to happen anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20253\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20255\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20257\">THERAPIST: (pause) That seems like maybe what you may be trying to fend off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20259\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think I felt like I was a little bit coming to terms with just the whole situation and getting over it. She\u2019s here and that\u2019s over and dating and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025B\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025D\">CLIENT: And yet not feeling that disappointed with him, actually.
