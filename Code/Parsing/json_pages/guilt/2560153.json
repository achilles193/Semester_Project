You know what I mean. And I\u2019m thinking, okay, my 3.8 could have been a 4.0.

And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F1\">now I have to get like four more A\u2019s in order to get a 4.0.

And I make sure that they get it, they understand that grades are very important and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB1\">stuff like that.

I never had the dating thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you\u2019re missing something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: At one time I did because\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: When was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like okay my friends and then my cousins \u2013 one I\u2019m really close to \u2013 you know, then it\u2019s like you look at them and to me it\u2019s like they always talk about, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have no man all up under me and I can go out and have all this fun and stuff.\u201d And then, you know, and I be <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E51\">thinking. Okay, you go out and have all this fun and stuff. But then deep down, though, I don\u2019t think they are really truly happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: Me, well, I wonder.

I\u2019m pretty sure I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: How do you think your marriage is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">[08:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">CLIENT: You know, I think it\u2019s healthy and you know, we joke a lot. It\u2019s like more\u2026if I had to weight it on the scale, I would say the good is way better than the bad, you know. And I would say\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pretty happy. But then it\u2019ll take you back a little bit sometimes. You wonder, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200F31\">dag, what would it have been like to be on the dating scene and all that? And then I may go out with my friends or whatever and I look at the guys that are out here and I\u2019m like, uh no, I\u2019m glad. I mean you know because I see what\u2019s out here and now I don\u2019t really care for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">THERAPIST: So part of you was fulfilled for a while \u2013 being a wife, being a mother, raising your kids while they were in school. And when did that get to kind of you need more than that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">CLIENT: I need more than that when they graduated high school. When my youngest graduated high school and then I said okay, now what are you going to do with yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">[09:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">THERAPIST: And how long ago was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">CLIENT: It was last year. Wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">THERAPIST: I was going to say, it couldn\u2019t have been that long ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">CLIENT: 2011. Was it \u201811? Yeah. No, \u201812.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">THERAPIST: So now it\u2019s \u201cyou\u201d time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">CLIENT: Yes. And I\u2019m trying to give it all to myself. You know what I mean? I\u2019m trying to go for the gold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20107\">THERAPIST: Which looks like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20109\">CLIENT: Well, it looks like it could be a combination of things. You know, like I told you before, I found myself doing things I\u2019ve never done before and it\u2019s a little scary, but it\u2019s interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Well, one we talked about was kind of having more fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010D\">CLIENT: Well, I haven\u2019t gotten to that point yet. [Laughter.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010F\">THERAPIST: What are some of the things that you\u2019re doing that you\u2019ve never done before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20111\">CLIENT: Oh, well not really. That\u2019s a good question. Okay, let me think about that for a minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20113\">THERAPIST: Alright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20115\">[10:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20117\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve always written things down, you know, because I guess I enjoy writing. But I would be writing things that really had no meaning. I mean it\u2019s like I\u2019m just writing. At one point I thought I wanted to do greeting cards because I had all these brilliant ideas, right. So\u2026and I got a notebook <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201171\">full of stuff that\u2026and I wanted to call it Something For the People. You know, simply saying things that you want to say that you are afraid to say. You know, and I mean like being really blunt. You know. Okay and I stopped doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560153\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">THERAPIST: Alright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">CLIENT: Then as like I could be writing down\u2026it used to be a time I would not go anywhere without carrying my notebook, you know, because I never think or never know when something is going to pop in my head and I want to write it down. And I wrote like a few things, I guess you could call it poetry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B1\">but when I listen to what other people are doing I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s poetry or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">THERAPIST: So you have a very creative mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">THERAPIST: Well it sounds like it; whether there, you know, poems or kind of you think what would go in a greeting card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that about for you, Yvette?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">CLIENT: You know, I think it\u2019s maybe me\u2026hmm; maybe writing down some things maybe I was feeling, you know, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">[12:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Okay, tell me about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D\">CLIENT: Hmm, okay, well, I could remember I wrote some\u2026I wrote something but I think at that time I was thinking about my aunt. Oh God, I\u2019m going wail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012F\">THERAPIST: What are you feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20131\">CLIENT: My auntie. Okay, this is the aunt I told you wanted to adopt me; wanted\u2026I don\u2019t know if I told you, but she wanted me to make sure that when she passed away that she had an all white\u2026the Bible and you know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20133\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re going to have to go back and tell me. I don\u2019t think you told me about this one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20135\">CLIENT: Oh my God. I didn\u2019t do it. You know, and a lot of times I was like, God, I didn\u2019t do what she wanted me to do. I didn\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">[13:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20139\">THERAPIST: Okay, so Yvette, take me back for a second. You know, I can see this is really tough. Tell me about this aunt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013B\">CLIENT: Okay, I mean she was the best. I mean like really. I do this all the time, right. I think it\u2019s because the tears is because I held back so many years without, you know, so maybe I guess it\u2019s just time for them to come out I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">But she was the type of person I could go to when my mom was\u2026I don\u2019t want to say not being a good mom or whatever, but like when I knew she wasn\u2019t being fair. You know; would blame me for stuff that I didn\u2019t do or stuff that I should have done that I didn\u2019t even know I should have done it. And I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D1\">go to my aunt when my grandmother was at work or whatever. And my auntie would give me just good advice, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Is this the aunt who took you to the doctor; who was going to\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20141\">CLIENT: Yes, this is her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20143\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20145\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like she was the mom I felt I should have had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20147\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20149\">[14:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014B\">CLIENT: You know what I mean. It was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Can you say more about that? That\u2019s a pretty powerful statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014F\">CLIENT: She was\u2026would always talk to me, you know, about your body and how to be a young lady and things like that I felt my mom should have done. And she would like teach me how to do certain things, would allow me to help her in the kitchen. You know, had the patience. I knew she loved me. Well I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2014F1\">knew my mom loved me, but it was just different and I felt like, I think, with my aunt I was the daughter she never had.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2014E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560153\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">THERAPIST: Okay. You guys had a very special relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. You know and then it got to the point where she would see my mom do things to me, say things to me in front of my friends like to embarrass me and stuff, but I don\u2019t think my mom realized she was embarrassing me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">THERAPIST: Is this when she was high?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">[15:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">CLIENT: I think it started\u2026this was before she actually started the hard stuff. I think back then, maybe, she was just smoking weed, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Alright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t know. I think that\u2019s what that was. And I remember my aunt made a comment. My mom did something \u2013 we had a bike that we had to share and my friends came over and they said well can you get your bike, you know, and come outside? And I said, well, I did all my chores and everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D1\">and my homework is done, so I\u2019m pretty sure my mom won\u2019t mind. You know, I did everything I was supposed to do. And when I took the bike outside, I don\u2019t know what happened, you know, I was riding the bike and everything was fine. Then out of nowhere, oh my goodness, she just went ballistic. And I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D2\">she yelled at me\u2026I think I got a whipping on the front porch in front of my friends. And everybody was laughing and I couldn\u2019t understand why she did that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">[16:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">CLIENT: And I remember my aunt telling me, no; she argued with my mom about that. And I remember hearing her say that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to take her and I\u2019m going to adopt her. And I was like oh please Lord, please. You know what I mean. And but that never happened. I used to bug her all the time; you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201631\">said you were going to adopt me. So are you going to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20167\">CLIENT: And I think she was talking out of anger then. As I got older, I stopped asking, but I was always with her still, so it didn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20169\">But then that day came and I don\u2019t know what it was, but she had me and her two boys sit down and she said well I want to talk to you about something. And at this time, you know, we\u2019re just young kids. I was in high school, like maybe a freshman. And she said when I pass away, I want you to do this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201691\">I\u2019m giving each one of you a job. And we were like, we don\u2019t want to talk about that. You\u2019re not going anywhere. You know. And she was like no; you\u2019re going to sit down and you\u2019re going to listen. And okay. So she told me what my job was \u2013 make sure she had on white and make sure she had the Bible in her hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016D\">CLIENT: And I said, okay, I can do that. But you know, I\u2019m not thinking she\u2019s going anywhere, you know. And I would say because every day when I get out of high school I would stop by her house, but there would be some days I wouldn\u2019t have enough money to stop and then have to go, you know, get back <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2016D1\">on the bus and go home. I said well, she doesn\u2019t always have money all the time, so she may not be able to have the money for me to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016F\">So, but I mean it\u2019s like I stop over there like almost every day; every day. But this one particular day something just told me to go straight home. You know, I don\u2019t know; something with me and these little voices, you know. And it\u2019s almost like God is just talking to me like he\u2019ll make me hear what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2016F1\">he\u2019s trying to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20171\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">[18:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20175\">CLIENT: And I said okay, but then that stop came up and I was like oh, I really want to go over my auntie\u2019s house though, you know. And I didn\u2019t move. I just stayed on the bus and I went on home. So I wasn\u2019t really worried about it. And when I got home, you know how you\u2019re a kid; you\u2019re just sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201751\">in front of the TV. You\u2019re eating your candy or whatever. But then my grandparents come over. And when they came over, they said\u2026it\u2019s like you could look at them and see something wasn\u2019t right. My mom went to the door and they said, \u201cShe gone.\u201d And when they said that, I wasn\u2019t thinking nothing at first, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201752\">but then I looked at my mother and her face, you know. And then I looked at my grandparents and I\u2019m like, oh wait. I said, \u201cWho gone? Where did they go?\u201d You know, and then she said Lacey is gone. And I\u2019m thinking now, my grandmother\u2019s sister\u2019s name is Lacey. I love her too. But my aunt\u2019s name is Lacey, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201753\">and that scared me. And I said, wait, what Lacey. Not that it should have mattered, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20174-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20174-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560153\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: Well sure it mattered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">CLIENT: That one that was real close, you know, and that\u2019s the one she was talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Your aunt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yes.

I couldn\u2019t react. You know, because it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t believe it. You know. So let me see. I think when it was time to go to the funeral, because they were saying how she was found. You know, her and my grandma talked every, every, every every <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201831\">day, but when my\u2026I think that\u2019s what bothered me the most. My cousins were young and when they came home from school, their mom was on the couch and they thought she was sleep, and she still had the phone in her hand. But they said that they didn\u2019t notice anything. You know, they\u2019re little kids just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201832\">playing. They went on outside and played and everything. But when my uncle came home and saw her on the couch, he said he knew something wasn\u2019t right because usually when she sleeps, she snores like oh man, you know, wake up the dead. But she wasn\u2019t snoring. And then he said he went in to the room and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201833\">he came back out and she hadn\u2019t turned over or nothing and she still had the phone in her hand. So that was unusual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">He said when we went to touch her, she was ice cold.

You know, do you realize that grieving someone is honoring the relationship you have with them. We never just get over. I mean you\u2019ve had some huge losses and the theme in all of this is you know either you feel God speaking to you or you know steering you away from kind of being there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C71\">when the loss happens. But the theme is always you\u2019re supposed to do something or you\u2019re supposed to intervene or you know, with your grandmother or CPR or making sure your aunt wore white. And that is a heavy burden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT: I mean yeah.
