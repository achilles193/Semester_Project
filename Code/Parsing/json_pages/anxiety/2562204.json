I did a pretty good job of having a whole weekend entertaining us and chaperoning us around the campus. It was good. It was very easy, in terms of I wasn\u2019t really grilled on research or anything.  The interview was very conversational. I think it went pretty well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So she should get back to me soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Thank you. It was nice because it was a very different atmosphere, too, having faculty and students in the program already really interested in what you do or where you\u2019re from, just talking to them for a couple of days.  It was just different from the usual thing I do. It was good. It was a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">nice break. The interview was Saturday afternoon, so I spent Saturday night with my parents. That was okay. They\u2019re so \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the word is \u2013 unwilling to do something else other than go along.  They\u2019re so engrained in their way of life or schedule. They just can\u2019t multitask or they can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">do something outside their norm. It\u2019s always very frustrating to see them and they don\u2019t really want to do anything.  (pause) I guess I just don\u2019t know what I can do to make it better between them and myself because I just get so angry at them. They just don\u2019t want to do anything or they don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">to improve on their situation.  (long pause) It would probably be a pretty big adjustment if I moved back there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Is UNC pretty close to where they are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. Where they live is like a suburb of Boise, which is (inaudible at 00:05:54), so it\u2019s like a 15-minute drive.  (pause) I guess I just don\u2019t know how I feel about potentially leaving Philadelphia. (long pause)  I guess, other than that, I\u2019m not really looking forward to getting back to work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">I feel like there is so much going on. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: [I wonder if you\u2019re concerned that] (ph?) I don\u2019t want to hear or talk about stuff that\u2019s different from what we usually talk about, either to do with your parents or thoughts about moving back to Nashville. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) I\u2019m just not sure about moving back to Boise, in terms of if I\u2019m going to do it. My parents are just so frustrating, but I don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s more of a (inaudible at 00:11:06)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess it just feels like moving back would be more problems and so many more things I had to do. I don\u2019t really want that. (pause)  I feel like with all my family stuff, I\u2019m the one always doing something. I\u2019m the one always seeing the bigger picture of something and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">want to go and then everything just kind of falls on me. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: It does remind me of the feeling you have here, where I might have feelings about how things are working or maybe the logic of the way you feel about certain things, but I think you still feel very much like I guess I do leave it up to you to figure out what you want to do or how you\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">to handle something. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause)  [My parents worry, try to make a plan or yell at me;] (ph?) but for me it\u2019s just kind of like what\u2019s the point? Deal with crap as it comes later rather than do anything .

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not quite sure what to make of this, but there is a way in which you kind of show me or, in a small way, kind of put me in the dilemma that you\u2019re in, saying to me, \u201cHey look, Ethan. There is really no point in getting into it about them or talking about what they\u2019re like because it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">not going to go anywhere or do anything or make anything any better,\u201d which is a bottleneck. There is a lot in your saying that, but one thing is, I think, kind of like \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything that you can do\u201d or\u201d I don\u2019t think you should bother to try to help me with this because there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">nothing I\u201d \u2013 I mean you \u2013 \u201ccan do.\u201d  I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong about that. I\u2019m just saying it sets up, in some way, kind of a parallel here. Obviously, it\u2019s a very small echo of what it\u2019s like for you to deal with them. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I guess I just really hate dealing with them (inaudible at 00:19:42), so I just want some way that I don\u2019t have to.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s pretty clear that it makes you feel horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Right. As much as I say something or as much as I\u2019m angry or as much as I argue with them, [I just feel like it\u2019s worse. Things only just get further and further] (ph?) and I don\u2019t want to deal with it. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I imagine part of it is how depressing and demoralizing it is for you to see how limited they are in being able to really talk to or connect with you about the things that feel like they really matter in your relationship with them. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: There is no desire to connect with them, I just want them to improve their situation so when something bad happens, it doesn\u2019t all fall on me to deal with it or to come up with a solution. I think the boat has already sailed about me being close to them. I don\u2019t want to be. I don\u2019t really care <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">for that, I just don\u2019t want to have to deal with their crap if (scoffs) something happens. I feel bad for them, but it\u2019s their own fault so \u2013 whatever.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Do you mean the kind of stuff like Stu, where your mom is sort of trying to force you into being the go between and you also just have to kind of deal with it because she could never have the kind of relationship with him where she could talk to him about it, go out and visit him, anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">like that; nor can she deal with her own stuff so that she can keep herself from freaking out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019ve got to kind of cover all the bases for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right.

(pause) She won\u2019t change, as much as I tell her that she\u2019s being ridiculous or as much as I comfort her. She just stresses out and lets everything affect her. Now she doesn\u2019t do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">anything and I just don\u2019t understand how my mom got in this situation.

She would just say \u201cI do the best that I can,\u201d blah, blah, blah, \u201cwith what I have.\u201d  But I can\u2019t stand it. I hate being at home.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And I think you probably also imagine that the result of any hope I might have or seem to have or effort that I make or seem to make is kind of going to make things worse, just confronting you with how shitty all of this is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right.
