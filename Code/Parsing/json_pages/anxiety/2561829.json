But with the snow day on Friday, I ended up rescheduling a bunch of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: But luckily this worked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: So how have you been and what\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Well, I think I saw you before Josh (ph) had the surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So last I heard through e-mail they were waffling on it. So they did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So they ended up shuffling around a little which caused both of us a little stress. But they did it and it went well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And he\u2019s now just recovering which is good because then we\u2019ve got progress towards going home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Just bad news every day. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Which pump did he end up with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: He ended up with the double pump. So... (PAUSE) It\u2019s... It\u2019s pretty like Medieval. Like it\u2019s... (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) My (inaudible at 00:00:53) the day before his surgery. That was... It was like, \u201cNext year, there will be this internal pump that will have these like...\u201d These two pumps, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">like look like they\u2019re from the 80\u2019s and they hang out your abdomen, pumping your blood around, attached to a giant air compressor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Wow. That\u2019s a pretty big adjustment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he hasn\u2019t been himself yet obviously. He\u2019s been drugged and out of it and in a lot of pain. So... (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: He just sent me an e-mail this morning that he\u2019s going to go for medical marijuana as his like home pain thing because they\u2019ve like exhausted the amount of opiates or whatever he\u2019s supposed to really be getting. So right now he\u2019s getting like (inaudible) and Tylenol which is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Which is probably not cutting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: You know, I was really surprised. Like I thought they\u2019d be giving him hard core drugs for a while and they\u2019re trying to get him off of them really fast and then telling him because he\u2019s small, thin, and young that he\u2019s going to have a lot more pain than anybody else. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Huh. That\u2019s interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like the more muscles you have...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Then it takes longer to heal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: ...the smaller you are, the more like it disrupts things and it just hurts more. So... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019ve gone from crying all the time to just sort of feeling... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure if numb is the right word. But just I\u2019m not really worried about tomorrow or next week. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">I guess (inaudible at 00:02:23) either. Just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Resigned. Does that feel right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I still feel kind of like in limbo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t decided how I feel, I guess, or what emotions I\u2019m having. I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) Which is better, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess it\u2019s movement from, I mean, feeling sad and hopeless to something else that you don\u2019t know. But those are pretty hard things to sit with. I mean, being so scared and feeling so sad is really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I think you can only do that for so long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Also, it\u2019s been really hard to interact with people (LAUGHTER) especially because this week people are coming back to school. I\u2019m trying to go to school. There are more people around. Anybody who\u2019s asked me what they want me to do or want them to do for me when they get back... I said, \u201cJust <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">hang out with me.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I don\u2019t (inaudible at 00:03:21) a lot of social plans. (LAUGHTER) So if I\u2019m not feeling totally miserable, that\u2019s helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So you have something to go do. A little bit... Being in touch with the other parts of your life... I mean, Josh and what\u2019s going on with him medically is one part. But it\u2019s not everything. I think it\u2019s hard to have it be everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to take me coming to the hospital a lot less. I tried to go last night just for a few hours and had to push myself away. Or not... I mean, he was like, \u201cOh, stay with me. Stay with me.\u201d I just couldn\u2019t stay with him (SIGH) forever. And I\u2019m going to have to like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">let go of not getting all the information that he gets every day. So hopefully I can make some sort of like separation (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Well, what kind of schedule do you feel like would work for you? Let me turn the sound off. Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Oh sure. That\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:21)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Am I your first appointment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yes. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I almost don\u2019t even care about making a schedule which is weird. I mean, who knows. If he calls me and he\u2019s like, \u201cThey\u2019re doing training on my legs today,\u201d I\u2019m going to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re going to go. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: So we have some... There\u2019s another couple in the hospital who are our age and the girl just had a heart transplant. So they kind of talked to us on Thursday. So it\u2019s going to be nice. (PAUSE) So I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t make a schedule. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s your...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: That I feel okay with, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like flexibility is really what you need right now. So being able to drop whatever plan you might have had and go into the hospital or something specific is happening that day or if he really needs you one day than another or if you feel like you want to be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess I don\u2019t want to be there anymore. It\u2019s... When I\u2019m at the hospital, I feel like definitely... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s exhausting to be at the hospital. (LAUGHTER) You barely ever just get to like sit and relax. It\u2019s uncomfortable for everybody else to be there. But... He\u2019s got <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">the hospital bed. Everybody else is sitting on some uncomfortable chair or something (PAUSE) moving around all the time when they come into like help with stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You feel in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it\u2019s exhausting. So I\u2019m just so tired of the hospital. So... (PAUSE) But... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">I mean, a lot of things have settled down. The dogs are taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh. What did you end up doing with the dogs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Oh gosh. They went to foster care (PAUSE) which like right after surgery, Josh told me how frustrated he was with me about that. (LAUGHTER) But he\u2019s accepted it, I think. So that\u2019s sad. But it\u2019s done. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Do you have a say in who the foster parents are? Is that placed...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: ...by an agency?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a volunteer group. Yep. So... But I met one of them who came to pick them up and she was really great. (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure you will. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I just... (PAUSE) I can\u2019t even think about the future, I guess, which is better than...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah. The right now is enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) I\u2019ve been sleeping a lot which is good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">I had a little bit of like a panic because my friend offered to go skiing with me last Saturday. But she wanted to go early and I had to like set an alarm. (LAUGHTER) I almost canceled on her. But I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: How was being out there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: It was great. I didn\u2019t get (inaudible at 00:07:25) lose my mind because I had her to ski with and Josh wasn\u2019t like sitting in the lodge being miserable like he usually would be. So that was nice. (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hardest at night. I take the train home from the hospital and there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">some couple on the train. (LAUGHTER) (inaudible) sad days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s understandable. It must be hard to see other people having kind of normalcy. Your life has not been normal at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Nor will it ever be or will it be for a very long time. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Your normal is going to be different and you don\u2019t yet know what that\u2019s going to look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m not worried more about when he comes home. I think I just know it\u2019s going to be really difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Are they making projections about coming home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Weeks (PAUSE) barring any problems. So... Yeah. It could be a couple of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Does that feel long or short to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Short. It feels short. (LAUGHTER) Because right now, he\u2019s being taken care of. When he\u2019s at home, it\u2019ll be (inaudible at 00:08:55).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well, I think finding out what kind of home health help, what kind of aide you can get and maybe starting those conversations or starting to ask those questions about like what\u2019s available so that it\u2019s not just you and his mom... But is there something you can get in transition or... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I lot of that takes a long time to like put into place. He could get on disability maybe in February which will help with work (inaudible). (LAUGHTER) And then they\u2019ll have a lot of options with the disability for (inaudible at 00:09:31).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you won\u2019t have that available when he comes home right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: No. (PAUSE) And my advisor has been very nice about it, really, really nice about it. So hopefully he\u2019ll continue to be. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPSIT: Yeah. Having support in school, you know, both from friends kind of doing stuff with you at school but also flexibility and, you know, understanding about, you know, your schedule. Your timeline might be a little bit different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: I mean, I\u2019m so grateful for school because, I mean, I was at the hospital... I just stayed there over the snow storm. I just didn\u2019t want to leave in the snow. (LAUGHTER) And there were nurses who were told they had to come in the next day so they were like sleeping (inaudible). I got an e-mail <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">from (inaudible) \u201cWe\u2019re not closed. So if you need to take an unpaid day...\u201d Like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d be doing if I was still working in a real place. (LAUGHTER) So I feel so lucky. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right now you have the kind of job that allows that flexibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I think being a grad student is a job. It\u2019s just not a high paid one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Oh right. But there\u2019s no, not very many rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. It\u2019s a lot of flexibility in how long you take to do your work and where...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: It still surprises me all the time. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">(PAUSE) So I am really grateful for that. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I think being able to note to yourself the things that you are grateful for is pretty amazing right now and also really helpful. Being able to see that there are, even though some things are so scary, that other things you do have that you can be thankful for makes it a little more balanced. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">It\u2019s pretty impressive that you can find them. They\u2019re there. But that you can find them is pretty impressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Well, I was really nervous about telling my advisor. It caused me a lot of stress. It was there and it took me a while to find out that it was okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I\u2019m glad his reaction was a supportive one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">When I saw you last, you were pretty upset at your mom\u2019s reaction to how she was handling, you know, the news about Josh and also her communication with you. How have you guys been doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: (SIGH) Good. I mean, they\u2019ve been coming to visit Josh which he loves. They keep asking me how I\u2019m doing. I mean, now that the surgery\u2019s over, it\u2019s good. My mom is channeling her energy more into helping rearrange my house and do like things that need to be done to help Josh come home. And we <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">don\u2019t really talk anymore about why I\u2019m staying with him or anything. And since my dad was really supportive, I just sort of let it be. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">I talked to a few friends about it. They were all like, \u201cOf course she would say those things.\u201d They seemed to think it was a reasonable reaction for a mom. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that like to hear them kind of validate her response?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s good. I mean, it makes it seem less horrifying. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: That they can see where she\u2019s coming from even though they don\u2019t agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I have a lot of friends who have way worse relationships with their mom on a regular basis than I do with mine. So... (PAUSE) As long as she doesn\u2019t, you know, disappear...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t sound like she is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Or continue to ask me what I\u2019m doing. It seemed like a onetime thing. (PAUSE) So... (PAUSE) I mean, and the dogs were a big source of tension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I know you were really disappointed with her lack of ability or willingness to do more for them to keep them out of foster care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Well, and it was also hard because Josh was so, so upset about it and upset at my mom too. Like I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll like hold a little bit of anger about that forever. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) He just doesn\u2019t understand. (PAUSE) So that was hard to have him tell me that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: ...and have to like pick a side, I guess. I wanted to be on his side. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Did you feel like you ended up defending her? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even know. A little probably. (PAUSE) You know, my parents kept asking what they could do to help and Josh was so mad. He was like, \u201cWell, just take my dogs.\u201d (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing you can do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, at some point, we should probably talk more about the, \u201cIt\u2019d be different if you were married comment.\u201d But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not ready to talk about it now. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: There\u2019s been more talk of like, \u201cWe should probably get married sometime before he has a heart transplant.\u201d (LAUGHTER) But... (PAUSE) In fact, one of his friends offered to marry us and that really threw me for a loop. I got upset for a couple of days because... I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Do you want to talk about that? What was your... What was your reaction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: It was just anger. Like I felt kind of (inaudible at 00:15:27). And it was a party. It wasn\u2019t, you know (LAUGHTER) you know, me marrying him in case he dies. Either at his hospital bedside... You know, we could get married but then we couldn\u2019t... We can\u2019t have sex for who knows how long. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">couldn\u2019t dance with me. There\u2019d be no celebration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You wouldn\u2019t have your wedding. There\u2019s a difference between the wedding and the getting married. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he\u2019s always been like (inaudible) and I always told him it was just tell everyone, show everyone, proclaim our love in front of everyone, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, the public kind of support and acknowledgement and celebration is a big piece of, you know, planning a wedding celebration that goes along with the marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, getting married (LAUGHTER) at his hospital bed would just seem so sad. I don\u2019t like just... (PAUSE) Really sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You\u2019d feel like you were missing out on part of what you imagined. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Well, it wouldn\u2019t be... There\u2019d be nothing... It wouldn\u2019t feel very celebratory or happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Because doing it now feels like a formality in case of disaster?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. (PAUSE) Yeah. Which is not helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Is not a good way to think about it. Yeah. (PAUSE) I guess one doesn\u2019t have to preclude the other. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: No. I just have to find a way to make it (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Well, or doing it in two parts. I mean, if you want to get married for the ease of paperwork...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: ...now and later when he\u2019s healthier and mobile and do the traditional wedding party that you\u2019ve imagined, you can do that. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I\u2019d also have to tell everyone, \u201cWe got married just in case he dies.\u201d Like I\u2019m just... And then later it feels like tragedy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: But it also makes me feel guilty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: What do you feel guilty about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

We even talked about before his surgery how we should get married before he needs a heart transplant.

(PAUSE) (SIGH) (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I guess that we\u2019re really committed going into this no matter what and everyone else knows it.

Like every time the question comes up, you decide to stay. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I mean, not wanting to go to the hospital doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t want to be with him. I can understand why you don\u2019t want to be with him in the hospital. The hospital is not a fun place to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) And I\u2019m still getting used to seeing him... I mean, he looked awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

He looked creepy.

And he has a huge gory slit down his chest. (PAUSE) And he hasn\u2019t been able to eat for a long time, not really, so he\u2019s like wasting away. He can\u2019t shower. He won\u2019t even like let me... He\u2019s so sick of other people touching him he doesn\u2019t even care like at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure vanity drops pretty low on the list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: I mean, there were definitely stages of him attempting to have a little privacy or like clean up a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s gone at this point. Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) And the nurses before were trying to keep him in one piece for a while. With all the stuff he\u2019s had post-surgery, there\u2019s just like no way.

It\u2019s a really shift in perspective than (inaudible) that he\u2019s gone through have really shifted his perspective on what is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even know what his perspective is right now.

I can\u2019t hold like a real conversation with him that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to be like when he\u2019s finally like back to the real world.

And one thing that sort of happens when you go home is you have a mix. Right? There\u2019s the elation of being out of the hospital and back in a more comfortable place. But there\u2019s also <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201491\">a lot of fear for a lot of families and the patients because so much of the support and like the safety net of the nurses stations right outside...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">THERAPIST: ...the monitors right outside that let you know what\u2019s going on are gone. So sometimes that can be really scary. I think the other thing that sometimes people have kind of mixed emotions about is that when you\u2019re in the hospital, it\u2019s a little bit easier... You know, what\u2019s normal around <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D1\">you is, you know, a bunch of other people that are in hospital jonnies (ph) and are being completely exposed to everybody else in the world and so a lot... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">You know, that privacy, that need for being a little bit put together... It\u2019s easier to let that go in the hospital because the baseline for...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: ...what\u2019s going on is so different. And when you\u2019re at home, it\u2019s kind of harder to hold that perspective sometimes because what you\u2019re used to at home is having a certain level of, you know, privacy and daily living kind of hygiene type of stuff that you kind of get a pass on in the hospital. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201531\">You don\u2019t have to keep that stuff up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: And so it can be harder to remember like that he\u2019s not going to be able to do that kind of stuff still. Hopefully, by the time he gets released, he\u2019ll be feeling better and he\u2019ll want to, you know, brush his teeth, have you wash his hair, that kind of thing. But it will be hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah. I haven\u2019t done well with stuff like that in the past.

And it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:25:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: He was right. Yeah. And his VADs (ph) going to be pretty precarious. There\u2019s a pretty high chance of a problem happening. So I don\u2019t know. Hopefully he\u2019s not just constantly in a panic about it. (PAUSE) And I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll be like in public. We had this... My brother\u2019s friend...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: Right. He\u2019s going to be... Pumps are obviously really visible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: Yeah. The guy... I think I told you my brother\u2019s friend has a pump.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">CLIENT: Just one though. He came and talked to him and he is still one medication to not be depressed about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s very common with heart patients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: Did I tell you that they tried to put Josh on an antidepressant but it was, not quite a sedative... They said it was for helping him sleep (inaudible). It was kind of one of the old ones that ended up being more for sleep than for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">CLIENT: But anyway, it turned him into this zombie. It was really scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: Oh. That\u2019s not great. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: So I hope... I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll try again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what his mood is. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s something to monitor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: They keep asking him, \u201cDo you want anything? Do you want something for anxiety?\u201d He\u2019s, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d But they\u2019re asking him like constantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2017C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: They\u2019d like him to say yes. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: They would which is a little... Yeah. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: Well, I think depression after cardiac events, I mean, even more minor cardiac events... It seems strange to call a heart attack a minor event. But in comparison, it is. Depression is pretty, more common after a cardiac event even for people who have never previously experienced depression. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201831\">And having that properly treated is really beneficial to recovery from the cardiac event as well. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">THERAPIST: Having them, you know, continue to offer, ask, evaluate is really important because if he does start to have symptoms of depression which is different from him being sad, him being concerned, him being angry about what\u2019s going on... That\u2019s not depression. That\u2019s a normal reaction to his situation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201871\">If, you know, if that continues in a way that makes it more indicative of depression than a normal reaction to what\u2019s going on, then treating that is really important both for mental health and for his recovery physically. So having people on top of that when he\u2019s... You know, right now, he\u2019s not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201872\">able to participate in therapy. But when he is, making that sort of an option as well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, the (inaudible) worker, I hope, the social worker\u2019s potentially starting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">CLIENT: So that\u2019ll be really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That may be something he\u2019s more willing to go to than traditional therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: He has... Yeah. But he probably should have had therapy a long time ago. I\u2019m not sure now he\u2019ll need it as much. I mean, I\u2019m hoping that the... He\u2019s really excited about (inaudible at 00:28:11) part and the thought of that in the future...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s really excited. Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how these pumps are going to make him feel especially if he has to have them for months and months and months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: Who knows? But I\u2019m hoping that the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">THERAPIST: He has to have them until he gets a new heart. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yep. And they have a pretty high complication rate. So there\u2019s a non-small chance that he could end up back in the hospital with them. There\u2019s other people waiting in the hospital until they get a heart. It\u2019s awful. So I\u2019m glad he gets to come home at least because it\u2019s definitely a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D1\">chance he wouldn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: But kind of being on edge, looking for something that\u2019s gone wrong with the pumps is going to be hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be like that or not. He does go once a week until he gets a heart for like a clinic checkup. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: That will probably feel like a good safety net for both of you. Right? So then you get to not have the be the person responsible for determining whether something\u2019s a problem or not and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. As long as he doesn\u2019t find a problem the day after. (LAUGHTER) But yeah. Really, I would like to find a way for me not to have to take him every week also. (PAUSE) Which I\u2019m sure I can figure out. But, I mean, at this point, if he had had therapy a long time ago, it could have almost helped everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Well, just to have another person who\u2019s supportive and pathic (ph) and kind of part of the team.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yep. And he\u2019s changed so much since he went into the hospital about how he feels about all of this. Yeah. Who knows how he could think when he comes home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">CLIENT: Even just wanting all these people to visit... He had his boss visit last night, just sitting there looking like death, thrilled that his boss came to see him. So that\u2019s huge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m glad there are so many people that will and do come see him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he said my friends can come. He doesn\u2019t care, anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">THERAPIST: I think that support is really important for both of you, you know, for you to be able to stay in touch with people. Asking your friends to hang out with you is great. But also so it\u2019s sharing the burden, right, of spending time in the hospital, of being his support. That\u2019s a lot of work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B31\">That\u2019s a lot of energy. So for you both to take advantage of the fact that he\u2019s got a network of people that want to check in on him and care for him...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">CLIENT: Right. But we\u2019ve never done that before which is such a big regret. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">THERAPIST: It took you some time to get comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Your process of getting to a place where you could share that was the process that you had to go through. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">THERAPIST: I think it... You figuring out how to be comfortable with letting people in and letting people know what you need, figuring out what you can ask for, it took you a long time to figure out how to do those things. But now you\u2019ll take advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">CLIENT: I was wondering maybe the other day if... (PAUSE) Like a lot of my anxiety came from having problems that were big but not so big that I was forced to like basically shut off my like worrying about tomorrow. I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m happy about how I\u2019m feeling at the moment which is starting <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C11\">at the moment and thinking about it. Tomorrow will be whatever it is which is very different. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like some, the enormity of this crisis was big enough that it didn\u2019t leave any room for questioning in your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">CLIENT: Right. Which as awful as it is, almost feels...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a relief not to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">CLIENT: ...it\u2019s a relief. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB\">THERAPIST: ...not that have to be the one in charge of deciding whether it\u2019s big enough. It just is. It\u2019s big enough to make it all about right now and give you permission to ask for the help you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s almost like when there\u2019s a huge snow storm and everything is shut down. You just can\u2019t do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t go anywhere. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to decide whether it\u2019s safe to go in or not or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">CLIENT: Right, right. Exactly. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. This was a pretty big snowstorm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. But the having no choice is great (LAUGHTER) in a way, a twisted sort of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, the responsibility of having to make the choice is a lot of responsibility and I think the responsibility did cause you a lot of anxiety. Your challenge now is how to hold onto your comfort with asking for help, getting support, making those decisions without it feeling stressful <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB1\">and without needing it to be such a significant crisis. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">CLIENT: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want to have to live in crisis mode all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">CLIENT: There was also the problem of like when I had to give this talk right before things got really bad and I just didn\u2019t even care. I had to like really drag myself back into... I guess that was a little bit of anxiety. Right now, if my advisor said, \u201cOh sorry. Goodbye,\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E11\">care. (LAUGHTER) Like which is not good either. But I want to do that without being a little, I don\u2019t want to say anxious, but a little, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Engaged, aroused. I mean, those are words that you can kind of give yourself as that, as a place where you do care about stuff. Of course you don\u2019t care that much about school right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E5\">In the scheme of things, it\u2019s not that important. Right? I mean, yeah. You need to have a job and work at some point. But you don\u2019t necessarily have to put it all on the line to have this particular job. And most likely, you\u2019re not going to have to make that choice. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E9\">THERAPIST: But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201EB\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s weird to me. At least before things got weird with Josh, I wanted to do a good job and have a career that I liked and all that stuff. And at this point I couldn\u2019t really care less. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. If I\u2019m doing anything important... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201ED\">THERAPIST: I mean, I think right now you\u2019re facing life and death questions. Career really important... Certainly my wish for you is that you\u2019re going to have a career that you really like and is fulfilling. But when you\u2019re talking life or death, it\u2019s second in line at least. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201EF\">CLIENT: Oh my gosh. There\u2019s a lady recruiting for nursing school the other day at the hospital. If somebody had pushed me, I would just quit Yale and go into nursing school. Because there\u2019s also like... It\u2019s been so fascinating in a little bit of a way. It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You\u2019re learning a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) And like that I would feel like I was doing something useful and important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F5\">THERAPIST: You are doing important and useful things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F7\">CLIENT: Well, career wise. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. I think I spent all last week looking at how you can become a nurse. (PAUSE) It\u2019d be easy. It\u2019s not that hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure you could do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201FB\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s only like a year or two.

They\u2019re very important people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201FF\">CLIENT: And his nurses like 90% have been amazing.

I think, the amount of time you\u2019re going to spend in the hospital, you\u2019re going to be learning a lot about what his particular care needs are and will be able, I\u2019m sure you probably have at times, picked up some slack where the nurse wasn\u2019t great or caught something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20207\">CLIENT: Well, yeah.

Maybe it\u2019s just breathing and facing each moment as it comes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019ve been feeling like I can, like I don\u2019t want to hide out. I\u2019m trying not to hide out because I could just like watch TV all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20250-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20250-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561829\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20253\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20255\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20257\">So yesterday my friend invited me to get my nails done spontaneously and my first reaction was no. I\u2019m just going to hide out all day. But I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20259\">THERAPIST: And your nails look great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025B\">CLIENT: Thanks.

So I think the idea of just taking each moment as it comes and when somebody asks you to get your nails done and your first, your gut reaction is, \u201cNo way,\u201d you next thought is, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And if there\u2019s good reasons why not, then okay. But if there\u2019s not really a great reason why not <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2025D1\">then you kind of face the public. And that can be for, you know, whether it be going into school, going into the hospital, going in to get your nails done, just to double check your responses and push yourself to be out there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because that\u2019s always been a problem. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20261\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Hiding out doesn\u2019t really help. You do need time to yourself.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20267\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s healthy. I don\u2019t care what I do.

I think, when you\u2019re in crisis mode, thinking about what\u2019s working right now should keep you okay. That\u2019s what you\u2019re focused on. Is not caring forever a good long term strategy? No. But this isn\u2019t a long term thing. This... You know, day by day. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s probably progress that I\u2019m not crying all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026D\">THERAPIST: I think it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026F\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20271\">THERAPIST: It feels better, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20273\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20275\">THERAPIST: So sometimes the straightforward simple answer is actually the right answer for you.

(LAUGHTER) So I managed to get a random emergency mental health doctor on the phone to get a prescription <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2027F1\">for Ambien and it was a really awkward, strange, uncomfortable conversation.

Like if you go to (inaudible), they do, they have an outpatient mental health place where they have plenty of prescribers working there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E5\">They will separate it out where they\u2019ll do the psychiatrist or clinical nurse specialist do the meds and they work in conjunction with a therapist if there\u2019s therapy as well. Or any of the other clinics like, you know, there\u2019s a bunch of Yale places around, there they separate meds versus therapy. Most <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202E51\">psychiatrists that go into private practice, it\u2019s been my experience that they go into private practice because they don\u2019t want to do meds only. So they tend to only take on patients that are willing to do both their therapy and their meds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that makes sense if you\u2019re not associated with anybody else. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E9\">THERAPIST: Right. So...

(PAUSE) So next week I have lots of time on Tuesday the 14th and I have some time on Friday the 17th. I know it\u2019s hard for you to predict.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I\u2019ve got nothing planned.

(PAUSE) Can we make one more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20301\">THERAPIST: Sure.
