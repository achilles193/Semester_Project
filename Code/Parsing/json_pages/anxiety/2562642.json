I know someone who\u2019s very good and I also have a pretty big network of colleagues here who will know some people there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay. One of Tanya\u2019s friends visited over the weekend. Her sister has just moved to Maryland and is struggling to find a therapist that works for her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I know someone very good I\u2019ve got but I\u2019ve been in contact with them a couple of years ago. But I can I bet you I can dig up his name. I thought he was very good when I spoke with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Thanks. If it\u2019s not too much trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Thanks. So I felt like last week\u2019s session was very helpful. So I\u2019ve asked if you could prompt me more and keep (inaudible at 00:03:40). I really appreciate that. I felt much less like I was floundering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So thanks. I think you asked the question did I feel like I was floundering in my everyday life. I think I sort of said yes yes and no. The answer is probably more yes than no in some ways. But like this is an anchoring point in some sense. So, uh (pause) helpful to be here and particularly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">helpful last week so, thanks.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I think I also expressed that I felt anxious while we were talking. I didn\u2019t really have a reason as to why, but after I left I think that because it\u2019s that I rely on the session that I was and sometimes am anxious that like we won\u2019t get to something, not that I have a particular thing I need to get to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">But like the time is very precious to me so I might waste it or something. (pause) So those are my summary thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">We were talking at the end about what constitutes a good reason or a bad reason for making relationship decisions. I thought maybe we could take that up again.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019d be happy to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Thanks. (pause) It\u2019s sort of it occurs to me that I should probably talk out some of the features of the last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">So Tanya\u2019s friend Candace came to visit. Candace was Tanya\u2019s roommate at William &amp; Mary. A very good friend; she\u2019s great. So one of the few people for who it\u2019s always good for for who for Tanya it\u2019s always good to visit so, it\u2019s helpful to have her be here. It\u2019s good.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">She got in on Wednesday and then left Friday evening, so it\u2019s kind of a strange time period but, she was on spring break from the teaching job that she works at. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">So I think that the most salient piece of that is that like I think there\u2019s two pieces of it that in terms of preparing for Candace to visit, you know, cleaning the apartment, converting the room that we have a table in to a room that has a bed in it so Candace could stay with us, I did all of that work.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">So particular, you know, just how guests. So maybe the more important things is Candace got in on Wednesday when Tanya was at work and so Candace and I sat and talked for a while. Then her sister I don\u2019t know if I knew this and had forgotten it, but I think that I knew this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">Her sister is bipolar and that was a real struggle with she had been diagnosed with that in high school for Candace, so it was interesting to talk with her some about how this has affected Tanya\u2019s illness affects her and sort of her understanding of my position in it.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562642\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">I had the sense that I can express but not explain very well that like being able to talk with Candace in that way was something that is missing from my relationship with Tanya to a large extent. Not particularly about those subjects but those were part of the conversation. (pause) So that seems important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: When you say talked in that way, how do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s the right question but I don\u2019t know how to answer it.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Did you ever like sit and have coffee with someone for a couple of hours? It\u2019s that I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: You sit you might like sit and sort of talk about news events or talk about what\u2019s going on or what you\u2019re thinking about and progress through that to talk some about like what\u2019s going on in your life. And sort of here\u2019s a whole conversation that has many different parts that are not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">related but in some ways like form the whole thing. Is that a am I describing an experience you understand? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">That. Sort of that thing. I don\u2019t know how to articulate it better than that. But there\u2019s a sense of like scope and depth to it sort of like. We talk about we can\u2019t talk about many things and it doesn\u2019t have to stay shallow in any particular way. There aren\u2019t like intense moments of danger of some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">kind in the conversation. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: And so with Tanya that feels like moments of danger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: [Laughing] Sorry, I said it and I sort of [Laughing] saw you grab on to that one. [Laughing] I think you should and I understand why you would, but yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But this doesn\u2019t come there are not intense moment of danger, implying that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: [Laughing] Yes, I know. Yes, so there are certain topics that like set Tanya off or that Tanya can\u2019t talk about. Those feel dangerous to me because I don\u2019t trust Tanya to handle her emotions. So I guess I don\u2019t have trust that it\u2019s going to be okay or that like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">So we\u2019re taking and I mean Candace and I were talking and you know she was essentially asking how I was doing in all this. She was here last year while Tanya was doing the ACTs so like I don\u2019t know, that was I think a very hard time for her, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">And so I was (pause) I said well you know, we\u2019re back to there in some sense. It\u2019s not as bad but we\u2019re back to that like back in the hospital. This is a reset in some sense or feels like it. And so it sort of raised the question of like is this ever going to go away? What does our future look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">And I think that was when she told me that her sister was bipolar and that like it had made her start to wonder also whether this was a thing that was going away or whether this what this meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">And so we both sort of sat with that for a moment and she was okay, I need to talk about something else. That\u2019s too much, so we did. Tanya can\u2019t do that.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: The sitting with it, the (inaudible at 00:14:09)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: No, no the last part, that I need to talk about something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Like this is going in a bad place for me personally. Can we move to something else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: So modulating somehow or moderating?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562642\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. (pause) Protecting herself also and expressing her needs at a time when they can be met still. In that same situation Tanya would not say anything until it was like until she was already overwhelmed by whatever negative feelings there were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">That\u2019s not helpful to anyone. Not that it\u2019s not accepted to be overwhelmed by feelings but that like\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It seems like you\u2019re really important observation is interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: So I think that\u2019s a large part of what I mean about like intense moments of danger,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: That she can\u2019t take care of herself in that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Then maybe at times going there is okay. But to not be able to not go there at times when there are other things you need to do, you know, or just sort of function in your day, you\u2019ve got to wrap it up and move on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. And when you\u2019re exposed to situations where things like that are coming up or are going to come up, like some sense of being able to draw appropriate boundaries and say like I need to not go there right now, before you\u2019re there.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">So in couple\u2019s counseling Monday, I can\u2019t remember exactly how the conversation evolved over time, but it ended up talking about Tanya\u2019s work at her church being about like taking care of people, sometimes like going and so she would go to the morning service on Sunday sometimes and then like afterwards <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">go with someone to visit someone who couldn\u2019t make it to church.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">Yes, and she talked about it in the context of like this is a thing that is normally very good for her but gets very, very hard as she gets worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">Dr. Jannis [ph] picked up on it as a thing like this is a thing that helps you feel better which is true and a nice observation. But he also then like brought that to our relationship in the context that like maybe she would feel better if she felt like she could take care of me which is definitely <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">a thing that she says or believes or wants to do, which eventually to me, expressing the view that I (pause) I don\u2019t particularly trust her.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">And that description of the issue, the one that he was giving sounds to me like you should let her take care of you as another thing that you do to make her feel better. Like you should extend some arbitrary amount of trust, not because it like because that will help her. And I found it frustrating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Did you share that with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Oh yes, yes. Perhaps less politely than I would have liked. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me how that frustrated you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: (pause) Yes, I guess I started the summary of the things that happened that week by saying that I did all the preparations for Candace to come visit. That takes time in addition to like spending some time with Candace, it took all weekend to sort of catch up on the things that I had not done <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">while I was doing those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">It\u2019s very frustrating to hear like I guess it\u2019s frustrating any time. It\u2019s particularly frustrating in that context to hear like, well if you just do a little more, Tanya will be better. Like if, you know, which (pause) yes, if you do a little more Tanya would be better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">Maybe that\u2019s true somewhere, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the point at the end of the day. I think the point at the end of the day is that Tanya can\u2019t take care of herself or can\u2019t always take care of herself. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562642\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">I\u2019ve certainly become frustrated talking about it. I\u2019m not sure if I articulated why I\u2019m frustrated but\u2026 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well let me make a running analogy which may not be helpful to you so, but I\u2019ll give it a try. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">So and I was thinking well you can tell me if this feels like part of the point. Maybe it\u2019s a little bit beside the point, but the focus of couple\u2019s therapy is different than the focus of individual therapy for a lot of reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">But specifically as it relates to someone relationship, the focus of individual for couple\u2019s therapy is not whether either partner wants to be in the relationship. The goal is to make the relationship the best relationship it can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">Whether one wants to be in the relationship or not is a separate issue. A very important issue but not really the focus of couple\u2019s therapy. It\u2019s kind of like when a personal trainer answered and said I\u2019m not really sure I want to get into this do this race or, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">But that\u2019s not the personal that\u2019s not that\u2019s a separate issue. You go to a personal trainer, the personal trainer helps you get to that train for the race. Whether you actually want to take the steps to do the race is a very important question, but it\u2019s not one that you talk about with the personal trainer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">Does that make it\u2019s not a great analogy. It actually is a pretty good analogy but that\u2019s sort of how I don\u2019t know if that addresses some of the frustration that you\u2019re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: (pause) Yes, so let me let me make the analogy a little bit worse by stretching it more than it probably needs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">So now turning to your personal trainer the coach, and you\u2019re running a relay race and one of your relay race partners has a broken leg, but the coach is still trying to train you to win the race, that\u2019s I think more how it feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">Well if you just run twice as fast like, you know, you guys will almost be as good as you were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s actually a really I think that analogy I think that at least that analogy conveys to you what you\u2019re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: I felt like it was good at doing that at least. I\u2019m glad that it worked. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">So you know, it\u2019s and part of the thing about feelings is that I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually what he\u2019s doing and, you know, I actually think he\u2019s very good and I\u2019m glad that we go to him for the most part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">But right now I\u2019m very frustrated with this idea of like trying to make our relationship better when in fact Tanya is out of the crisis where she was hospitalized but she\u2019s still pretty bad. Like she\u2019s not doing well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">So we go there and like [Laughing] we can\u2019t really talk about trust. I mean we did because that was where the conversation went. And I didn\u2019t avoid it like I do sometimes. But that ends up in the place where I say like I don\u2019t trust here and why should I so which I feel like is not particularly helpful <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">to Tanya when she\u2019s, you know, struggling with her broken leg. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well but it\u2019s the truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And I have to believe that the truth is helpful somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: (pause) Sorry, I wasn\u2019t laughing to dismiss that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562642\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">Yes, that\u2019s a viewpoint that I am committed to also, but I don\u2019t always feel (inaudible at 00:27:05).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">So yesterday so Tanya like in the morning Tanya will get up and then get ready for the day, and then I\u2019ll get up around the time that she leaves, depending on when she leaves because she leaves at different times of day. And so often it\u2019s the case that she\u2019ll like come say goodbye as I\u2019m still half asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">So yesterday she sort of said in a slightly peculiar way, goodbye James, which she never really says my name when she\u2019s saying goodbye. I don\u2019t know why, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">And, you know, so I was concerned for a portion of the day that she was going to kill herself. (pause) I think that expresses my feelings about truth and dangerous or something, too.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: This sounds like such a simple statement. And perhaps, live in a way I don\u2019t mean it at all, but ultimately you need to decide what you want and if you want this. And part of the problem with this is it\u2019s not clear what this is. Is this how Tanya is always going to be? Is this a very bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">stage in her life that she will move on from at some point? Those are unknowns. And so that decision needs to be made with those unknowns because those are unknowns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">It certainly seems likely that this is going to go on for some time. It\u2019s certainly not clear to me whether this is just going to be a life-long illness that will basically have this course. Or whether she will get better. It could really go either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">And A, that you have to think about whether either of those situations are okay, and if you ultimately want this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: (pause) You know that was strikingly direct. I appreciate it. (pause) Yes, I don\u2019t know how to make that decision with what you think you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">(pause) So half this why would anyone want this, you know, that all hinges on the meaning of want or the variety of different maybe hinges on this; I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">Yes, so in other contexts I have something like three responses to uncertainty. One is to formulate a test case that will differentiate between possible outcomes. That\u2019s not really I see no way to do that here when the large uncertainty is what\u2019s going to happen in the future that really becomes not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">a useful way of handling the problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">(pause) One is to reduce the uncertainty as much as possible and then leave the uncertainty uncertain, but that usually goes hand-in-hand with the other ones. So like here\u2019s a range of possible mechanisms for a chemical reaction. We can rule out all but two of them. We can\u2019t decide between them but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">leave at least ruled out all of the other ones. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">You did that some time ago, right? You presented the manifold of worlds in which I would be okay and hence, essentially two features on it. So, and that was helpful in the short-term. That\u2019s not particularly helpful in like which of those will I end up or should I end up on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">And the third is to sort of attempt to estimate the uncertainty we\u2019re bounded in some way. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s actually feasible here either. So I didn\u2019t hear real well beyond that, just said something about uncertainty. I don\u2019t know what to do about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">(pause) Actually I think there\u2019s a fourth thing too. So in terms of like personal decisions I think I will attempt to (pause) sort of observe other people making simple decisions and sort of monitor my reactions to them and, sometimes that\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s the reason that I like well written TV shows <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">actually. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562642\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Well maybe another way of looking at it, which sounds like it\u2019s missing a piece, but that sort of how Tanya will fare in the future. If you take that variable out and say what if that doesn\u2019t matter that much? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">I mean I is this the marriage that you want to be in now, and are there enough things about Tanya that you love and value? And are there enough parts of your moral system that you feel committed to that this is the marriage that you want to be in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">And so just to try to sort of assess, well if things go better, the future of this will be worth it versus not. Maybe that\u2019s not as important. It seems important in some ways, but then I thought about more and I thought, I don\u2019t know. Because even I mean you can sort of make your argument and say <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">five years from now Tanya is doing better; well ten years from now she might not be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: So sort of try to assess, based on your current investment, be very crude, you know, later outcome on current investment maybe is not a very good way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">I think that\u2019s clarifying. I was sort of sitting here thinking about so, if I were to stay I this marriage it\u2019s clear to me that I need to construct the rest of my life in such a way that is fulfilling in the ways that this marriage is not, or else I won\u2019t be happy right, because that\u2019s which is more <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">or less exactly what you said many months ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">(pause) Yes, I was also thinking about I don\u2019t want this, but I also think that vows are important and I don\u2019t want to walk away from that commitment that I made. But if I hadn\u2019t made that commitment I would have my only reasons for not walking away would be concerns for Tanya\u2019s wellbeing in the short run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">Like I actually don\u2019t want to hurt her. I do love her but (pause) \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: And if that\u2019s true that you will need to find a way to have that be more sustaining during these periods, meaning that, you know, your commitment to commitment answer that being your kind of moral code and value system, that sort of maintaining that; adhering to that, will need to sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">help you weather these more difficult periods. You know getting some satisfaction that you are adhering to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">In other words this shouldn\u2019t only be a reason not to leave, it should be a something that sustained you while you stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) Yes that I hadn\u2019t thought about. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">That seems like an interesting topic for all on its own (pause) in terms of if it\u2019s that important to me, why don\u2019t I find it sustaining or something like that? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42:02) experience is something that\u2019s confining and is limiting your options. That\u2019s a very different thing than something that you\u2019ve proactively committed to and that you feel fulfilled you feel good about fulfilling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. (pause) Yes, I need to think about that a little bit more. I sort of feel like there are broader implications, but I can\u2019t pull them all out right now. And I also feel like it\u2019s a little bit my own thoughts on it are sort of distracting from the main point; if that makes sense. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562642\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">Yes, so I guess another way to describe it is I feel like there\u2019s a conflict between my, as you put it, commitment to commitment and my desire to not be unhappy forever or not be unhappy right now. And I guess there is some resolution to that conflict in what you were just saying. (pause) But I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">don\u2019t know how to work out that conflict in general.
