[0:04:00] Doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: So why is the HMO out-of-network reimbursing you $150? That shouldn\u2019t be happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: No, it shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s probably\u2026 let\u2019s see, they\u2026 all right, there are a few things. Let me back up. So I [recently heard] (ph) where they are processing the latest request form\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: After I sent it to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I call them once a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: [And it ended up they hadn\u2019t gotten from] (ph) (inaudible at 0:04:53).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right.

So my guess is that\u2026 there\u2019s a little form, a little thing you can check off that says, will you accept the in-network rate, which I did check because it made it much more likely they would pay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: But they said yes, and then they weren\u2019t paying me the network rate. So I don\u2019t understand why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: Okay. So the employer PPO would reimburse you $75?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It would depend what the co-pay was, but yeah, it would be $75 per visit. I mean, I could\u2026 actually what they would do\u2026 if we were on our current schedule, they would do probably $90 minus the co-pay for Monday. [0:05:54] And then I would bill them for a longer session. You can bill for an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F1\">hour session, but that\u2019s the longest. So I bill them for that for Thursday. And they reimburse I think probably\u2026 might be $150 minus the co-pay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT: Why can\u2019t you just split it up into two\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">THERAPIST: Hour-long?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">CLIENT: Two 45-minute-long sessions, and\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">THERAPIST: Actually, I think I probably could. It\u2019s a good question. In the past you didn\u2019t\u2026 you couldn\u2019t do that because they wouldn\u2019t let you go for more than one per day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559865\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: So can you bill for\u2026 we didn\u2019t meet on Thursday twice. We met on Thursday, and we met on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That I could do, but that I wouldn\u2019t do, because\u2026 it might be fine, true. But what I might be able to do now, because they\u2019ve changed the codes, is\u2026 you may be able to do that now because now it\u2019s the same code whether you see somebody for individual or family? [0:07:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So I could just bill for the same code, and they\u2019d never know that it was two individual\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: And somehow that untruth is better than our other untruth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Sure, because they\u2026 it\u2019s not like they check or it\u2019s their rule that it has to be individual and family. But that\u2019s why they made the change to allow it, because it could be. Yeah, actually, that\u2019s what I would do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.

[0:09:05] But it\u2019s still not equivalent. The problem with joining Jeremy\u2019s PPO is that it only works out for us if I see you for the whole year, for ten months out of the year I think it was, or something like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200991\">(Pause) And, considering that it feels like it\u2019s been two weeks since I saw you on Monday (pause), that\u2019s a ton of time.

I mean, it sounds like\u2026 it\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s probably a few hundred bucks one way or the other. [0:10:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: What, to join the PPO or not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(Pause) [1:17:58] We got really good (inaudible at 1:18:00). We\u2019re sort of dog-starved? Do you have a dog? Jeremy grew up with dogs his whole life, and Vermont is a pretty spiritual place. Everybody has a spiritual place, but there\u2019s some beautiful things about the state that make it feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202071\">really nice for growing beings, plants and dogs and chickens (ph) and people. So he grew up with dogs all over the place all the time. And they live in the country. They had a very nice life. [1:18:57] And Jeremy had a pretty special bond with dogs that maybe surpasses, for him, the closeness that he <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202072\">feels with humans, probably all humans. And definitely his communication skills definitely\u2026 and this is my opinion, are better with dogs than with people (inaudible at 1:19:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20206-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20206-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559865\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020B\">CLIENT: So we are pretty obsessed.

[1:19:57] And the dog countdown was themed in some way? So it would be like, okay, this week\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020B1\">countdown is dogs with flowers. So it would be like, the first week of the countdown, send eight or nine pictures taken off the Internet usually from people\u2019s photo streams in an e-mail. And then the next person would do it the next day, and then the first person would do it the next day. So we did, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020B2\">like, 20 of these. And we have this gorgeous painting of all these\u2026 I don\u2019t know, we just sort of have a lot invested in how much we love dogs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D\">So our landlords Morris and Ellen (sp?) had written no pets on the lease. [1:20:57] And we think a lot about getting a dog, and always in the equation is, well, we would probably have to move, or we would have to convince Morris and Ellen. So it came up yesterday, sort of spontaneously. I was describing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D1\">to Ellen how we\u2019re going to Ocean City this weekend for our first anniversary. And we chose a B&amp;B that has two really beautiful dogs, as maybe the second priority out of a lot in what B&amp;B to choose. And I told her [we\u2019re dog-starved] (ph). So then we talked about a bunch of other stuff, and then she <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D2\">picked up\u2026 she came back to it and said, you guys are dog-starved, and then proceeded to explain her love of dogs and Morris\u2019s love of dogs and explain why they wanted to get a dog, and it just doesn\u2019t work with their travel and this and that. [1:22:05] And so she ended up basically saying, we love <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D3\">dogs, we trust you guys, you can get a dog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Wow.

And I\u2019m coming to a place that I [want to keep working on] (ph), and I don\u2019t want any more change. [1:23:56] But then mostly also what I was feeling was feeling really, this was going to be threatened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021F\">THERAPIST: Huh. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20221\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s really confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20223\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20225\">CLIENT: This provides\u2026 what this provides and what you provide overlap with what a dog would provide. And then, what am I going to do with two of those things? One of them has to be\u2026 has to change. Or maybe that would change how we are and how this is. Maybe it would be less important, or maybe I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202251\">hurt less, or maybe I would care less and maybe would go away. [1:24:58] I would make you go away, or I would feel really differently about you. And that would [make it difficult] (ph). (Pause) [1:26:00] It made me think about, what is the natural course?
