Sometimes I have something to start with in my head and (inaudible). I have a couple of like scars running down my arm that were almost faded and then my arms started getting tan and they've gotten much darker and that's bothering me. But, oh well. I don't know what I'm going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">do. I feel like when I want to hurt myself, the knowledge like that scar's not going to go away necessarily doesn't actually, isn't enough to keep me from doing it. (inaudible) way for much. But like well fuck, then I'll have scars all over me.

I just find it embarrassing because like I self-injure and am kind of embarrassed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">about it like it's just juvenile. It's the most juvenile thing I've ever done and I can't sort like pretend I have done or I don't know because it's right there in front of me all the time. I guess I just worry that people will like, will always see it as unstable in the way it has been (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(Pause): [00:04:34 00:04:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Guess I'll just have to wear sunscreen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">(Pause): [00:04:45 00:04:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I was at a party with (unclear) and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Is that a (unclear)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: My employers. (Unclear). And so there were a lot of kids running around everywhere and there was a kiddy pool set up and so it was like everybody putting on bathing suits and sunscreen and the whole process and somebody told me that like the priTanya time period for damage that won't lead to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">skin cancer later in life is like zero to five anyway, so I am screwed. (Laughs) I don't think I put on sunscreen until I was at least 10. Oh well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">(Pause): [00:05:53 00:06:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I mean I guess it's good that I actually am thinking about myself in 20, 30, 50 years. But not necessarily that hopeful, peaceful thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(Pause): [00:06:26 00:07:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: So my church has decided that this coming year is going to be like the year of the Bible and they're going to focus on actually reading the Bible which (unclear) actually do that much. (Laughs) And especially like the old testament because their seems to be a general consensus that no one really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">knows what's in there anyway and it makes them kind of embarrassed and uncomfortable. So you know, I think it's a good idea and I been anxiously turning over in my head whether it should offer to help in some way because I actually do know a lot about the old testament.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: And I don't really know. It's a big church so like programs like these have like committees and hierarchies and bureaucracies and it kind of like said this is what we're going to do and no one said anything else. They're not going to start it up until September. And I don't know if I'm even <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">going to be here in September. So that's sort of one excuse I hear myself making.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559807\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(Pause): [00:09:36 00:09:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: But (whispers).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(Pause): [00:09:46 00:10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: It's really anything (inaudible) involved with the church (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(Pause): [00:10:01 00:10:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I spent like two days working myself up to sending an e-mail telling the priest who preached this week that I liked his sermon. And I'd be like, 'no, he really not going to be upset about that.' No, people like to hear that they do things well.' (Laughs) No, it's fine, Tanya.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(Pause): [00:10:48 00:11:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: It's a little weird going So my, the church I grew up in is also called Calvary, which is weird because the Calvary I think is kind of weird but it's like whatever. (Laughs) But it was not like in some places I felt comfortable, like the space I was really comfortable in. Like both in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">like sanctuary, like the church itself and in like all of the like the whole area. I just played there a lot. Because we lived, literally, across the street from it. And so we just ended up playing (unclear) like in all the storage closets and things which I'm sure was really fine for the people who <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">actually wanted to store things there. But, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">But like I never really felt comfortable with any of the people that I remember. It was weird. So I'm not really good about remembering people's names, and I wasn't as a child and so there were like this whole, probably like a third of the congregation I never knew their names, but they knew me and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">I saw them every week. And I'd known them for years and I was supposed to know their names and I didn't know their names and I couldn't say who is that person without I basically solved that problem by leaving town. And now I just like I fuck it, I'm not going to be embarrassed about it. Like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">asking people's names when I forgot them because otherwise I'm screwed. We're going to have a yearlong relationship and I won't know who they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(Pause): [00:13:17 [00:13:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's like how I know some parts but like how a church and a congregation runs like really intimately and some parts just scared shit out of me. Like talking to other people. You know it's really nice to feel like I really know people in the congregation now but also part of me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">wants to show up and then go home and not talk to anybody because that's scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: You know. And also because like worship is usually a pretty like emotionally heavy time for me and it's hard for me to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I imagine it matters to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Snap out of it.

(inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">(Pause): [00:15:54 00:16:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: You know, when you grew up in a vestry not vestry. A vestry is a place for people that are the executive board. In the rectory, which was across the street, which was built, I think in like 1810. So it's like a big old plantation style house. It's got like a dog run and it was just like sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">of a shit hole actually. It wasn't maintained well at all. In some ways it was fine and in some ways it was not fine and like you know there was really no, you know it was a really old house so there was no central air conditioning at all, of course. And like it would get so hot in the summer and my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">bedroom was on addition so it would be much hotter than the rest of the house because it was like, it was either brick or stone but the house was much cooler than it had any right to be, in general. My room was like 5 degrees hotter than anywhere else and it would get so hot that I'd set up a fan right <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200613\">at the end of my bed and it would still be so hot that I couldn't sleep so I'd get a bowl of ice and just like eat ice until I could go to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559807\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">And then there was no fan in the bathroom so there was mold all over the ceiling and it got to be this very, heavy intricate pattern of mold and I remember just like being in the bath and looking at it like, 'oh, like this is interesting, look at patterns.' And then like eventually, at some point in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">my adulthood I realized that most people's bathrooms like when that happens, just repaint, but that isn't really what happened for us. Like our dog that was a German Shepard was deathly afraid of thunderstorms was like I like tied her to a banister during a thunderstorm once and she chewed out a couple <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">of the banister rails and like that never got replaced, ever. The water made me throw up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Drinking water from the tap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. It took me a long time to notice the connection that if I drank a whole lot of water I would throw up a couple of minutes afterward. And I like that got dealt with eventually but that was because it happened to Tim (sp?) not because it happened to me. Because it was said and that wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">really listened to at all. And it was because we had well water and the well hadn't been checked or like wasn't being maintained properly. And then right before we moved out, they found like, somebody inspected the basement, which was unfinished. It was like a storage place and flooded pretty much every <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">year, and they were like, 'oh, there's dangerous mold down here. We need to fix this because it's poisoning you.' I was like, that's where we used to play in the summer because it was too hot upstairs. You know, so I think part of that. And the thing is, the house didn't belong to my dad, it belonged <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200673\">to the vestry and they were responsible for the upkeep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: They were responsible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, typically a part of the priest's salary, I mean these days they steer away from those methods and they have included a stipend for housing, but it's kind of like traditionally, the priest lives in the rectory and then the vestry keeps the rectory up. Or the church does, the church's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">responsibility. And so it's like I don't feel so good about that. You know, they started doing repairs the last couple of years we lived there but I think it was because they started to realize that my dad wasn't going to be there forever and they needed to protect their investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: But you know, my dad part of me says like that was also the way he was raised, like that was the way his parents like his parents' house was like that but much, much worse. Except the house they lived in as far back as I can remember was newer, so they didn't have stuff like the structural <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">kinds of things, but none of the dishes were ever clean sort of thing. Well, he just didn't notice.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559807\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: No, no.

Sayers. It's a mystery novel from the '30s. The female protagonist has been anxious with the male pro you know, she's sort of in love with this guy but like doesn't want to get married because she doesn't want to be in a position of being limited or limited by her husband which <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">looks like protecting her. And is afraid after a letter she gets that he \"was being about as protective as a can opener.\" (Laughs). I like that a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: That was pretty evocative, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Yeah, I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: I mean, especially in that context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: I'm sorry, I'm trying to take this seriously and it's getting increasingly difficult. Yeah, I read that book a whole lot, probably ten times, and I don't think that ever occurred to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I mean it's not just a metaphor but the context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: She's pointing to a guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">(Pause): [00:27:16 00:27:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's like the correspondence is important for the character that she realizes like is part of her being like she like basically one of the questions of the book is how do you reconcile the life of the mind with relationships? Particularly if you're a woman and so basically like she sent <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">him like she's a detective but she's the one who has been commissioned to solve this mystery. She like sent him a letter saying, 'hey, I'm working on this problem and it's like getting increasingly dangerous so we'll see how it goes.' And he writes back and says basically, 'well it seems like you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A72\">doing really good work.' Let me know if I can help.' And that was the opposite response that she expected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Which is something about his sort of like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: 'Let me step in and take care of this for you.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">(Pause): [00:28:58 00:29:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: And also feels like me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: That can also be like me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: So as soon as I said that I was like, 'oh, how next to talk about the context and that's going to open up a whole can of worms.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Oh, I know.

Whether it's true or not seems to be really secondary to, 'oh, that's a really good idea.'

But I think in terms of how it feels to me it's kind of like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">(Pause): [00:32:36 00:33:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: I don't think well see here's the I don't think talking about the scars, like I think the analogy breaks down or the image breaks down because like I cut myself so I don't have to do this. This is much harder. (Laughs) And more painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">(Pause): [00:33:52 00:34:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: I don't feel like cutting myself is to exert some control over the situation and (Pause) I feel like this conversation is spiraling rapidly out of my control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">(Pause): [00:34:44 00:35:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I think part of what you're saying is that this all feels the same. The damage that you're describing including the sun, including the mold, including other things from when you were small and the cutting yourself and talking about it I think part of what you're saying is it all feels the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">same, like it's supposed to be protective. It's supposed to help you feel better. Like when you were a kid you were supposed to be protected, you weren't -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">(Pause): [00:36:14 00:36:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I feel those things go together but I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">(Pause): [00:36:25 00:36:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: The church was supposed to protect you from all sorts of things and your father was supposed to protect you and look out for you and how instead it was sort of the opposite. They dangerously neglected you. And the cutting is supposed to be like that as well. It's supposed to sort of provide <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">relief and I know that in a way it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: But now I have to deal with these scars that open me up to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly the kind of thing that you're trying to avoid by cutting yourself which is sort of exposure, examination, questions. And here, too, you came for help. And (inaudible) with stuff like, I mean at moments like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: (Laughs).

Something that has that kind of masochistic (unclear) quality or experience (unclear) that you may not choose consciously, but as like a can opener. Like I think you're exactly right that that is because it's what feels familiar <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201091\">and it's what gives you the impression for some reason that (unclear) you're doing something right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">(Pause): 00:39:42 -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: I don't know what the alternative is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">(Pause): [00:39:56 00:40:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: I mean in practice there are tons of alternatives. And you use some of them. For example, cutting isn't the only way you cope. Sometimes you watch TV, sometimes you read. You know there are other things that you do as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: Sometimes I just bear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sometimes you just bare it. My point is that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: I guess like I meant by not cutting specifically but like I don't it's hard for me to like imaginatively inhabit the mental space of somebody that didn't think that way, like didn't have this whole approach to wanting help and wanting comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: Like I can't imagine what it's like for other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: Which I'm usually pretty good at that sort of thing.

Really it's not in the capacity of like sort of the neurosis or something in the way that this all operates for you. It's hard to (inaudible) as opposed to your not being imaginative (inaudible). I think the thing is that arranging things in this fairly (unclear) masochistic way usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201211\">with the kind of immediate and sort of kind of na ve hope that it would just make things better but that sort of also makes it hurt a lot and kind of extends the problem of having to bear it sort of like some of the other ways you roll. It's something you seem to do like what we're tracing today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: And it seems also that part of it involves the sense that the other person, your church or your dad or me, like in the immediate moment the feeling is that we're supposed to be there to help so that you come out looking okay. We don't really get what's going on or what we're doing to you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201251\">And you're kind of usually (unclear) the way you arrange things, we come out looking okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">(Pause): [00:44:25 00:44:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: This is a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yes.
