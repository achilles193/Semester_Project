But if we have time to like, to ourselves, and we're arguing about something, we can usually either take a break for a minute and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200591\">get back together and figure something out or You know? Does that seem right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">FEMALE CLIENT: (whispers) I don't know.

Sometimes if your busy, Marlene (ph) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">FEMALE CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: you feel upset that you're not spending time together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">FEMALE CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: And it actually makes things worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">FEMALE CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: But a lot of times the way you think about your relationship is on like sort of week by week the circumstances of your week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">FEMALE CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's like with every relationship. There are stressors that come up and it depends if you're like exhausted or something's been bugging you like repetitively, how you're going to react. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">FEMALE CLIENT: So that's usually what it is. Like if I am overtired and he continues to do something that like would bother me, but I usually get over it, but depending on like, you know, if I can deal with it or not and how I react towards it. It's how our fights usually, you know. Either it's a quick <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A11\">fight or it's a longer fight. (laughs) It's how I react towards it, pretty much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">FEMALE CLIENT: And that's what I'm like learning. That I don't need to react like that. It's not a big deal. As long as he knows like what, you know, aggravates me and he understands. It's nice to know that like he understands me. You know? (laughs) That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't sound like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A51\">it makes sense to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">MALE CLIENT: Did you say \"stressors?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">FEMALE CLIENT: Just like I'm stressed out and there's something that's bothering me, and then something happens, like say you did something that really aggravated me. If I'm not stressed out I'd probably, you know, react differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">MALE CLIENT: No, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">FEMALE CLIENT: Or as opposed if I'm stressed out I'd probably like dig into you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\">MALE CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">FEMALE CLIENT: And I'm trying not to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B5\">FEMALE CLIENT: So. I don't know if you can tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B7\">MALE CLIENT: Mm hm. You're getting better at it. Definitely. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B9\">FEMALE CLIENT: (laughs) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You guys have your triggers, as most couples and people do. I see when you guys get triggered you go to a sort of dark place quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BD\">MALE CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BF\">FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like the last argument we had, like I felt that way. Like I felt like hurt by whatever. And he was like, \"You know, mood,\" or what not. And I felt hurt because I didn't understand why he was acting that way. And I kind of just left. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C1\">And instead of, like I'd like obsess and look at my phone to see if he called me. I didn't look at my phone, I just continued doing what I wanted to do. And like I got back in the car and saw that he called me and we were able to talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C3\">But normally I'd like stress out about the fight and I wouldn't continue to like, you know, go on with my day. It would just like bother me so much that I couldn't do anything -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C7\">FEMALE CLIENT: except just be upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200CB\">FEMALE CLIENT: And this time it was I had more control over that.

She's gotten a lot better with, you know, not like extending our argument throughout the rest of the day. It used to be if we got in an argument it would bother her for the rest of the day. You know? Especially if she went to work she'd tell me, she'd <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D31\">say, \"My whole day is ruined.\" You know, \"I'm starting off my work day like this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">But that doesn't happen as much as it used to, at least.

It's sometimes really hard to separate the affect it has on you with the intent. And that's what you're describing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">THERAPIST: That even if you get hurt that doesn't mean that's Steve's intent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">FEMALE CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">THERAPIST: Being able to separate those two things out has been very helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">FEMALE CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20107\">FEMALE CLIENT: Absolutely. Yeah. So I think that I saw myself doing that that day we got in a fight. Like, \"Oh my God.\" You know like, \"I can't believe he's acting that way.\" But I kind of, I was able to have more of a control over it than before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20109\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B\">FEMALE CLIENT: So it turned into a positive. So that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010F\">MALE CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20111\">THERAPIST: It seems like, Steve, you've noticed a difference too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20113\">MALE CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20115\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20117\">MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, things are a lot easier, you know, when stuff isn't, be repetitive but, you know, when things aren't drawn out and, you know, things aren't blown out of proportion. You know, it's a lot easier to talk things through and, you know, put things in perspective and rationalize whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201171\">it was really worth it. You know? [At least I think so.] (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20119\">THERAPIST: Do you feel that when Marlene does feel upset that you feel overwhelmed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2011B\">MALE CLIENT: No, I'm not overwhelmed. No. I mean I understand why she's upset. You know? And I used to think that, you know, that it was, you know, like you would bring things to that point where it's like almost life or death. You know, like extreme, very extreme. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2011D\">But she doesn't do that anymore. You know, I think she's taken it down a few notches and I think she's thinking about stuff. You know? I mean I can just tell that she's thinking, \"Is it really worth,\" you know, \"the argument?\" It's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2011C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2011C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559560\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">Plus I think she might be focusing more on work too. You know, she's really trying to (sigh) She's trying to get things together so she can get back in school and stuff. So I think the less we fight the more, you know, it benefits both of us. So I think that's also shortened things a little bit too. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F1\">You know, the length of our argument or just things in general, so we can be happy while we're at home spending time together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">MALE CLIENT: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. I know you've expressed, Steve, feeling kind of like stressed about the limits of time or the time constraints. And I'm wondering if you're still feeling that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">MALE CLIENT: We talked about this the other day. Not really. I mean, things have changed so much. You know, it used to be like, you know, if I'd go pick up my paycheck, you know, I couldn't I mean I knew every half an hour she'd call me or she'd send me a text or something on the dot, every single <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201271\">time. You know, whenever I left to go somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">But, you know, now she just does her own thing, I think. And, you know, I think she realizes that, you know, I should be allowed to go out and do that stuff. If I want to give her a call, I give her a call. If she wants to give me a call, she gives me a call. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">I think just knowing that she can do that is a little more comforting, rather than, you know, being in touch with me while she's at home without being with me. Like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know. It's hard to explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel like you're given a little more space?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012F\">MALE CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20133\">MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Or at least that's kind of It's been a while. I'm just trying to think. That's I think how things felt, at least for me. Like even though she wasn't with me she wanted to be like with me through the phone. Like that used to be a big thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20135\">But I think, you know, we try to spend more time together when we're together, so I think that kind of takes off some of the pressure of the whole phone thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20139\">MALE CLIENT: You know? And that gives me a little bit of feeling of the freedom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">MALE CLIENT: You know? When I'm out and about just doing whatever. But, I mean, I know we She brought this up I think, let me see, yesterday or the day before yesterday, that she doesn't, you know, she's not texting me and calling me all the time like she used to. You know, it wasn't a bad thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D1\">but I'm just saying I was You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013F\">Like she's just a little more relaxed I think, is the word I'm trying to find. Does that make any sense? No. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20141\">FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I am. I don't worry as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20143\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20145\">FEMALE CLIENT: And like I feel like my last relationship like I really had a bad relationship. And, I mean, I dealt with like some post traumatic stress because of that relationship. But I had to do like the phone because it was a long distance relationship and that's how we kept in touch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20147\">And it was always like, \"You didn't pick up.\" Or, \"Why didn't you answer my text?\" And I found myself like behaving, like picking up the bad habits of my last boyfriend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20149\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014B\">FEMALE CLIENT: And I think I brought that into this relationship because that's what we used to do with each other.

So it takes a lot. It takes a lot and I feel like you lose trust in people and you have to build that back up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201A9\">FEMALE CLIENT: So I feel like I'm there more than I've ever been in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201AD\">FEMALE CLIENT: So that's, yeah, it's a good feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B1\">FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. If you don't text me it doesn't matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B3\">MALE CLIENT: Mm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B5\">FEMALE CLIENT: He's usually sleeping. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B7\">MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B9\">FEMALE CLIENT: So then when he says he's sleeping, he's sleeping. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201BB\">MALE CLIENT: Yeah. My nap turns into a deep, deep sleep sometimes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201BD\">THERAPIST: This is sort of a random fact but it relates to what you're saying, like if you categorize emotions people have done this there's actually more negative emotions than positive emotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N201BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559560\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201BF\">MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C1\">THERAPIST: And, you know, just universally. And the theory behind that is that it's more important to keep Emotions help keep you out of danger, right? When you're angry or fearful you remove yourself from situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C3\">MALE CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C5\">THERAPIST: And so good emotions are nice but they don't do anything for you the way bad emotions do. They keep you out of danger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C7\">MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C9\">THERAPIST: And I think that's true of experience more generally.
