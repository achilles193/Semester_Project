I was driving here, I was totally, of course my mind was going a mile <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">a minute, and I was parking, whatever, and I was rushing, walking over.

But it\u2019s just annoying. I keep doing this. It just kind of freaks me out. I\u2019ve never been like this. I literally forget today my hat? It\u2019s in the car, but\u2026 I was like \u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to put it on the doorknob.\u201d Because it happens, it\u2019s like, twice a week, at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">least. I\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh, take the hat,\u201d whatever, and I\u2019ll just walk right by it, and just leave. Anyway. So, to cap the month off, the month of hell, on September 11th, I got a letter from some company, who I\u2019d never heard of in my fucking life. The letter proceeded to tell me that my loans are seriously <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">delinquent. My student loans. What? Okay. They said \u201cyou have thirty days from the day of this letter; otherwise they\u2019re going to default.\u201d Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: The loans you thought that you\u2019d consolidated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: That were consolidated, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019ve been paying off every month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: No. No, that\u2019s the whole other thing. I\u2019ve received nothing from anywhere. Once in a while I\u2019ll get something that just says, \u201cZero Balance\u201d. Like, Sallie Mae sends this electronic thing that just says \u201cZero Balance\u201d. I was like, \u201cHey, whatever.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was like, \u201cWell, until you send me something that says \u2013 you know, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Fine. Zero balance, zero balance. I have fucking problems [laughter]. You know, fine. Nelnet -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That is too good to be true, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Of course it is. Of course it is. But, I mean, you know. It\u2019s a two-way street. Let me know what I owe you. Send me fucking something, electronically or by mail. Tell me \u201cthis is what you owe per month\u201d. But anyway, so I was like, \u201cI have no idea who this is, whatever\u201d. Okay. Thirty days. Fine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">I get in touch, a few days ago, well within thirty days, right? I get a cold response. All it says is, \u201cAfter a careful review of your account, your loans are in default\u201d. Oh really? When did they go into default? September 12th. And I just lost it. I absolutely lost it. I was like A) I don\u2019t know who <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">the fuck you are, I\u2019ve never heard of them in my life. B) I just consolidated these fucking things and I\u2019ve heard nothing from nowhere. Forget Nelnet. Just, I don\u2019t know. Sallie Mae tells me I owe zero, I get nothing from the Department of Education, it\u2019s just \u2013 B) even, even, even, even if, let\u2019s say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200313\">I did know about everything, and I was getting statements, and I just wasn\u2019t paying them. Now they\u2019re gonna it cannot be legal for you to send me something that says \u201cFrom the date of this letter, you have \u201c right? So of course I didn\u2019t get the letter on September 11th. I got it two days later, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200314\">let\u2019s say? That means it was already defaulted. While it was en route to get to me. That cannot be fucking legal. So I just let them have it. I was like, \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t care. I will do anything possible to sue you. I really don\u2019t care.\u201d There\u2019s a lawyer out there that\u2019s going to take this case. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200315\">I\u2019ve researched them. I said, \u201cYou have so many legitimate complaints against you that are similar to mine\u201d. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a \u2013 if I can I will put together a class-action lawsuit. I really don\u2019t care. You are going to take this off my record. I busted my ass to consolidate them, I rebuilt my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200316\">credit. There\u2019s no way in fucking hell you\u2019re going to tell me that I\u2019ve defaulted now.\u201d So now I\u2019m waiting to hear back. It\u2019s like, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me\u201d. And they\u2019re like, \u201cJust get in touch with the Department of Education.\u201d Which of course I haven\u2019t heard back from, again. You call them, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200317\">you can\u2019t get through. It\u2019s a fucking nightmare, man. It\u2019s a nightmare. I try not to research it too much, because my head\u2019s going to explode. But these motherfuckers have dismantled this system to the point where you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, who\u2019s servicing what. Oh, and also, all the things I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200318\">reading from other people, I mean, they\u2019re just nightmares. They call, they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is not my problem,\u201d reps were telling them, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have taken out all these loans, you knew what you were getting into,\u201d What the fuck, dude? What the fuck.

Then I got the paper, fine, that was all done. Then I called them, right when it happened, I said \u201cWhat will I owe?\u201d, she said \u201cOh, it will be like three hundred something.\u201d I said \u201cHow will I know that?\u201d \u201cOh, in a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">months, whatever, you\u2019ll start getting statements\u201d. Never got statements. Then I got fired, you know. So, is that on me? Partly, but you know what? Fuck you. You\u2019re the fucking bank. You\u2019re not going to tell people what they owe, when they owe it? I have to chase you for it, and that\u2019s my fault too? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t fucking think so. So as far as I know, it was not this company. I don\u2019t know who the fuck it is. The research I did, turns out, there was a major lobby from nonprofits and for-profits, to try to become servicers of these fucking loans. So now, instead of just the government, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200473\">the way it\u2019s always done, just servicing themselves? They\u2019re outsourcing this shit.

There\u2019s no way. You can\u2019t send a letter, and I have the e-mails, I have the records here, I have the letter. There\u2019s no way in hell that can happen. I\u2019ve never heard of you, one. But B) let\u2019s say I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">have heard of you, let\u2019s say that things are delinquent. I\u2019m getting in touch within thirty days, and you\u2019re telling me not only has it defaulted, but it defaulted before I got the letter. And it\u2019s in writing. So I don\u2019t know how that can\u2026 you know. But that\u2019s enough for me to not want to \u2013 this shit <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">is getting really scary now. You read these articles, about like, people have been paying their mortgages, and the next thing you know, their house is foreclosed on. While they\u2019ve been paying their mortgage. I mean, I try not to read this shit, but it\u2019s like, every fucking day, there\u2019s a new story about, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B3\">just\u2026 Anyway, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re waiting to hear back from somebody more senior?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I called and I wrote to the Department of Education.

I was like, \u201cI know it\u2019s not personally you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">can\u2019t tell me your last name of course, but you know, I\u2019m beyond furious. This is absolutely beyond unethical, unprofessional, whatever. It\u2019s illegal. That\u2019s not possible. You can\u2019t do that\u201d. I\u2019m not a fucking lawyer, but I know enough to know that people need to know, before \u2013 and if you tell them <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">they have thirty days, they have thirty fucking days. I don\u2019t know what the upside \u2013 the upside is that I handled it, I addressed it, you know, I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m not curled up in a corner. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to find the upside today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t okay, you will be okay -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: No, this is a nightmare.

So that\u2019s where sort of no matter if it\u2019s a hundred per cent their responsibility, it\u2019s helping you to call, because the person who\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">to be on the hook is you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s hard to prove later, and you know, Kafka-esque system, you want to be on that from the second you figure out something\u2019s wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so unfair though, because they\u2019re not doing their part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: I read all these things, there were all these people, they were like, \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t set up an automatic bill payment, we thought we were paying this much, but they were actually taking more.\u201d I mean, where are we? What the fuck, man?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: How much is the total on the loan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: That was the other thing I didn\u2019t understand. They said $22000. So I guess they\u2019re servicing part of the loan? I have way more than that. Where is the rest of it? I have, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t fucking know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Did they not consolidate them? Could that just be one of the original loans?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: But if it was, who is this company? I stopped getting anything from anywhere saying \u201cYou owe money\u201d, do you know what I mean? Claire, honestly, I don\u2019t know. And the problem is, there\u2019s not one place you can call. You could go somewhere online, you can see all of your loans, but it\u2019s very confusing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">I don\u2019t know. You almost want one person to say, \u201cLook. This is what you owe. These are the exact places where your loans are\u201d. There\u2019s something very confusing about the system to me. It\u2019s not clear-cut at all. And I think it\u2019s rigged to be that way. Even if you\u2019re someone \u2013 it just happens. You try <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200772\">to keep up with things, you\u2019re going to miss a payment here, and every little nickel is a nickel to them, right? So if a few million people just miss one payment, it\u2019s confusing. There\u2019s not a streamlined way to look at this. Yeah, you can go online to the NLDS or whatever the fuck it is, but it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200773\">this crazy, little small print chart with lines, and you\u2019re trying to figure out has this one been written off, or who\u2019s servicing this, or subsidized, unsubsidized, FLP\u2026 you know, it\u2019s like, come on man. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: You need a rep on the phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: The reps \u2013 what happens is, this is what a lot of people were writing \u2013 it\u2019s as if they\u2019re really trying for you to not call. Because it\u2019s so infuriating. They treat you like such shit. They treat you like crap. Like, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d One guy was like \u201cI told them, how could you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">not send me anything?\u201d and the rep said, \u201cit\u2019s a courtesy when we send you things\u201d. It\u2019s a courtesy?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561742\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: In which case, if that\u2019s how they see it, they should have said that to you, right? They should say, \u201cWe don\u2019t send out bills\u201d. [crosstalk] \u2013 to send it online, and then it\u2019s your responsibility, you know not to expect anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly! By the way, that was the other crazy thing. I would log on, I did check. I would log on to the consolidation website, and it would just say, \u201cYour loans were paid March 5th\u201d. That\u2019s what it said. It says nothing else. I don\u2019t know where they are, I don\u2019t know\u2026 So anyway, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">hoping that they\u2019re going to fix this. Now if they don\u2019t, this is where being on top of it, but also having a fucking attitude\u2026 because otherwise I\u2019ll lose my mind. I got out of it once, I\u2019ll get out of it again, you know, but it\u2019s just another example of how this, the plan that I have, the equity thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">has to get done. It has to get done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Maybe even for a larger amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, if my uncle co-signs, then yeah. We\u2019ve got to do like $100000 or something like that. So obviously I can\u2019t pay much, you know, but I\u2019ll take like twenty grand of that, and just be like, \u201clook.\u201d Whichever one the most assholish ones are, just be like, \u201cShut the fuck up. Here\u2019s twenty grand.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">Clear this, you know. At least that\u2019s something. It\u2019s not something; actually, that\u2019s a lot. Over the life of a loan, that\u2019s\u2026 But see, that\u2019s the hard thing to get over. We\u2019re just living in a \u2013 everyone\u2019s just at each other\u2019s throats. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone to college, then, you should have thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">about these things. What do you think a loan is?\u201d So I guess we should be robots. We should all just be doctors, lawyers, and engineers. Or Bill Gates, business people, and just shut the fuck up, and just have no culture, no nothing, just everybody be the same, make a lot of money, and just shut the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200833\">fuck up, I guess. It\u2019s such a bone-headed thing to say. \u201cWho told you to study anthropology?\u201d My God, man. Where are we living?

But, no Ativan. I\u2019ve taken Propanolol every other day, maybe, but even that, it\u2019s mostly a placebo. I don\u2019t really need it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t \u2013 I think I have a very healthy not caring right now. Because honestly, if you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">trying to do all the right things, and pretty much you\u2019re on top of it, you can\u2019t let this shit \u2013 these things happen and as long as you\u2019re doing your best to take the right steps, it\u2019s going to be fine. Right now it just sucks, but you know. And, as usual, it\u2019s all relative. My friend Nancy, today, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200852\">she had a good idea. I might look into that, a reverse mortgage. I\u2019m suspicious of that shit, but I might look into it. As far as I know, that\u2019s a very different \u2013 there is no credit run [?], once you\u2019re past sixty-five, or sixty, or whatever it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Oh, really? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, because it\u2019s one of those, from what I understand, the assumption is, of course, you can\u2019t pay that off, right?

Past sixty?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Reverse mortgages are used for retirees. So obviously the qualifications are totally different. You own a home, based on that, the assumption is that when you\u2019re not around anymore, your siblings, your children are going to pay that. Or the bank\u2019s \u2013 in a way, the bank wins, because oh, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">dead? They take the house.

I didn\u2019t even have one. I don\u2019t drink at home. But that would have been one time where I\u2019ll just pour just a little whiskey, just to steady myself. Why? Why the fuck would I want to do that? And I had foresight. That felt good. I was like \u201cYou know what?\u201d I looked at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">how I\u2019m going to go, I\u2019m like \u201cThose are not roads that I want to feel buzzed in any \u2013 \u201c and I was right.

The one here in Boston looks legit, it takes about a year to do it, but I\u2019d almost rather do the Masters, and then take some classes at that place. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">But then there\u2019s some others that seem pretty legit, that are less.

You can\u2019t then let that start defining you.

It\u2019s not helpful, and it\u2019s egotistical. Even negative stuff like that is egotistical. It\u2019s not all about me, people are suffering all over the place, or they\u2019re up and down.

All I can do is kind of, I\u2019m in a very, what\u2019s the word? Self-care mode. I just want my iced coffee; I just want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">nuzzle with Sophie, while I take care of this shit. That\u2019s the refuge from dealing with this crap or thinking about it every day is that I just want to watch my Netflix, and cuddle with my cat\u2026 so it\u2019s \u2013 I crack a book, and there are books I want to read and I just can\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: So I wonder if there\u2019s something you could find beyond, or besides reading.

I\u2019m on LinkedIn a lot. I already have hundreds of, whatever, connections, whatever the fuck, I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m trying to figure that out. I posted on the life coaching <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF1\">LinkedIn group thing, hey this is me. I made a friend on \u2013 I saw someone on LinkedIn who\u2019s here, so I friended her on Facebook, and I might \u2013 she seems my age or younger, so not like, a mentor, but \u201cI see that you\u2019re a life coach, I\u2019m doing this, maybe we could grab a coffee\u201d. Did that.

That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m trying to say, though. I\u2019ve done all that, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t just pick up a book. I\u2019ll be at a coffee shop, I\u2019ll be doing all this stuff, and shouldn\u2019t I read a little bit of something, just read? And just look out the window? I just can\u2019t, I go right <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">back to like \u201cWho else can I connect with on LinkedIn? What jobs can I apply to?\u201d I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say is, because I\u2019m doing so much of that stuff non-stop, I feel like those other moments are actually really nice, because they\u2019re just about like, okay.

I\u2019m tired, and it just is what it is. The rest of the time, I\u2019m busting my ass. Yesterday at the coffee shop, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F1\">I got so into it. Again I had fed the meter, checked my iPhone. There\u2019s plenty of time. An hour and fifty minutes, whatever. I got so caught up in this fucking business plan; way over two hours. Way over. So of course I got a ticket. On the one hand, good, I was focused. So yes. My mind is very, almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F2\">obsessively \u2013 I\u2019m constantly checking for jobs on LinkedIn. I filter though things. I\u2019ll check for office jobs, and I\u2019ll check for teaching jobs. Or I\u2019ll think of ways to improve my profile. Like today I realized I didn\u2019t put my real estate license on there. Fuck it, that\u2019s an accomplishment. Put that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F3\">on there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">THERAPIST: I hardly ever hear of people getting referrals from LinkedIn.

I think if you work LinkedIn, if you really work it, like a part time job, you will get somewhere. You\u2019ve got to think the long game, because you\u2019re building relationships. And even if it\u2019s not referrals; jobs. Also because, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201131\">else am I going to do? You\u2019ve got to do whatever you can. I\u2019m applying to jobs, I\u2019m trying to connect with life coaches, I don\u2019t know. One thing I thought, I could maybe either e-mail Eva, or Molly, the other psychologist, like, \u201cCan we grab a coffee sometime\u201d. The thing is, I don\u2019t know what I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201132\">pick their brain about. They\u2019re psychologists. It\u2019s very different. Maybe I could say \u201cLook, I just started, I feel very confident and blah blah blah, but obviously I have questions, I\u2019m nervous\u201d or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">THERAPIST: Do you know when your unemployment runs out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: Spring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: Spring.
