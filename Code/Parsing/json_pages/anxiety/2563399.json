You have 50 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Nice, all right, great. How about that. I was right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: For some reason. So I had told you about the test. No, I hadn\u2019t told you about the test yet, how could I, I took the test on Monday, correct?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: You were getting ready to take the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I got a Band a B.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I know, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Good job, man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Thank you. No, it\u2019s funny too, because like I said, I knew the thing. But what was even more interesting is when I got to the place I realized that there was a table on the forms I have, which is a whole like probability of R=CNR, which just equals N factorial over R factorial minus N-R factorial, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">right, that whole equation for determining\u2026 for instance, if 50% of people in 100 smoke, what are the chances of a group of 15 people that nine of them smoke?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. So that\u2019s the sort of thing. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for. But it\u2019s so commonly used that all of the common combinations to do it are know, right. So you just plug in N, P and R\u2014NPR\u2014into a\u2026 rather N and R and then the [unclear], brilliant, so N, P, R\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: And then you get the probability?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And yeah, it shows all the various probabilities and you just add those up and you\u2019re like, boom, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: But yeah, I know, there it is, those are your chances. And so you can do it, like you say, do it on a calculator, but I\u2019m trying to do it as much by hand as possible, except when numbers are large. I\u2019m not going to sit there and do 9 factorial when I can just press a key and do 9 factorial. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I was trying to figure out if there\u2019s a simple pattern I could use just to get them right. Because 4 factorial is 24, right, which is just 4 times 6. Four plus two is six. So I\u2019m wondering like, okay, can you then go a couple numbers back, grab a number, add it to the one you want to factor <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">and just multiply those by the result of\u2026 multiply N by the result of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see, yeah, yeah. [0:02:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: And then put it\u2026 would that work. And the easy way to start there is like 5 factorial is 20, it becomes 60, becomes 120. And so then you\u2019d have to go 5 and 3 is 15. So 5 and 3 is 8, 8 times 5, no, it\u2019s only 40.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Doesn\u2019t work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, and if you\u2026 Although if you then do 40 by\u2026 but no, you still don\u2019t get it. No, you get 120. Five times 40 is\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Two hundred.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Two hundred, dumb ass. All right, yeah, so there you go. I\u2019m doing math in my head and chiding myself. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And chiding yourself. Yes, yes, that\u2019s familiar, chiding yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, yes, that\u2019s as I do. Something I\u2019ve been writing in the books is I\u2019ve been rewriting scenes, because I\u2019m like, ah, these are better, need to be expanded upon. So I\u2019ve had this whole scene written out a while ago where it\u2019s the two main characters and one of them is wounded, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">other one\u2019s defending the other against someone who\u2019s actually much better. But they take\u2026 if there\u2019s both of them they could definitely take the guy, but given the situation they\u2019re very lucky to lose. And so one of them gets very badly injured and he goes down, the other one just barely managed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200412\">like pull it out before passing out with serious concussions and very badly hurt. It had kind of like an after effect of like\u2026 Oh, then Bethany the Wizard, she comes in, she like helps them all out after they kill the guy and the whole thing. [0:03:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563399\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">And Ginny said, she\u2019s like, \u201cThe wizard just kind of like a plot device. Like she just kind of shows up as a deus ex machina, kind of off scene.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cSo\u2026\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna write more from her point of view, like because of the way she sees the world is different. She sees matter wherever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">she goes, and so she sees connections between things, and just sees the world in a way the other characters don\u2019t. So I get to write about that, I get to write about this whole scene where they\u2019re getting drunk and they\u2019re all\u2026 because after they\u2019re celebrating [unclear]. So I don\u2019t even know what it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">is yet, I\u2019m writing them out of order, so I\u2019m just doing a scene where they\u2019re all getting drunk together, and it\u2019s from Bethany\u2019s point of view, and she\u2019s, just for the fuck of it, she\u2019s like casting like detects poison, just for fun on her drink [unclear]. But then she\u2019s like alcohol is some level <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">of poison. And so like she\u2019s like all three of them [unclear], she\u2019s just laughing because of course it\u2019s poison [unclear] so it\u2019s alcohol. They\u2019d be like, \u201cWhy are you laughing? Why are you laughing?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re all poisoned, every single one of us.\u201d And just the funniness of that moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Hm. [0:05:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Exchange, they go back and forth. And it\u2019s one of the scenes where it\u2019s made more clear that Erin and Maggie live together, you know, that they have one place. And as it goes on other things are subtly made clear. Like when Erin\u2019s packing up to go she\u2019s feeling over the side of the bed, now <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">the bed is too big. That\u2019s just sort of a thing she thinks. And so there you go, it\u2019s like I figure I can write a love story without trying to write lesbian sex scenes because I don\u2019t know where to start. Apparently I could watch Blue is the Warmest Color just like a primer, you know, like every possible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">combination. I watched the lesbians reacting to the sex scene in Blue is the Warmest Color, it was really interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: What did they say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Basically it was like, \u201cThat\u2019s a very good display of all the usual ways in which women have sex with each other.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Is it? Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And they\u2019re like, \u201cWas it hot?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh yeah, and it was totally hot, yeah.\u201d You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: As opposed to the other one I\u2019ve seen which is women react\u2026 lesbians reacting to lesbian porn, as in lesbian porn made for men. And just it\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s this constant flow of like [unclear], and she\u2019s like, \u201cShe called her bitch. That\u2019s not hot. What the fuck?\u201d [overtalk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like, \u201cNah, no, nobody\u2026 I would never let anyone to do that to me.\u201d And like, \u201cLook how she\u2019s moving her hands. Like she can\u2019t make a woman cum like that, like it\u2019s never gonna work.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYou gotta think of shapes and continuous motion and repetition.\u201d And I\u2019m sitting there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">like, \u201cThank you, that\u2019s all very good information.\u201d You know, I mean\u2026 But you have to know this going in. You have to be like, oh, this is lesbian porn, this is not how women have sex with each other. It\u2019s not how men and women have sex with each other, right, it\u2019s like it\u2019s porn, it\u2019s art. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">it\u2019s like here are the various shapes we can make with our bodies so you can see all the [unclear] bits in different combinations. [0:07:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563399\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s for me to view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And for some women.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: For some women, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: You know, some of the comments are like, \u201cOh, my wife and I love this,\u201d or my husband and I love this, or you know. So it\u2019s like okay, yeah, most of the people out there that\u2026 Yeah, but it\u2019s meant to be viewed. It\u2019s meant to be viewed, it\u2019s not meant to be realistic. Although there are some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">places that are female run that are like that. Like, \u201cNo, no, we found these two hot women here who like want to have sex with each other so they\u2019re going to just do that, and we\u2019re going to have some cameras on.\u201d And you\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh, this all seems much realistic, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d You know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">Yeah, so\u2026 [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">So anyway, so I can write a love story without writing sex scenes. Or needing to address it really. But\u2026 Hey, but they\u2019re in love, you know, so what am I gonna do? That\u2019s just how it turned out. Those crazy kids. And I hear that, I hear writers talking about like, \u201cOh yeah, I didn\u2019t realize the characters <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">were gonna do that and then they did,\u201d and I\u2019m like, that\u2019s a weird thing. Then I\u2019m writing, I\u2019m like, oh no, I totally see what you\u2019re talking about now. Like these are the people I\u2019ve created, these are decisions they would make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re coming out of their own kind of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve had to like rewrite and change some of this stuff, because the stuff I\u2019d originally written doesn\u2019t really fit with who they become as I\u2019ve written more. And so in the rewrite I have essentially Maggie does save Erin to a degree, but then like not\u2026 you know, doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">win the fight, and then [unclear] spent, she\u2019s given her best. And that\u2019s a lot of\u2026 you know, the theme of it is like these are people giving their absolute best in a terrible situation. And it is not enough. And Maggie feels like it, because it\u2019s always been her Erin against everything. To the point <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">where she forgets that the wizard is still a factor and the wizard shows up at the end. Then I actually have a fight scene between the wizard and the bad guy as Maggie passes out and as Erin with broken ribs and a bunch of like cuts she\u2019s bleeding from is trying to get through\u2026 trying to get back in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200653\">the fight regardless. [0:09:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">But I get to introduce like what I\u2026 like with my magic system there is\u2026 because I have\u2026 you know, every [unclear] has some rule about how their magic works in their universe writing. And I\u2019ve designed my own per game so that I like\u2026 like taking bits and pieces from other stuff. But what I find is more <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">unique to mine is this concept of cost, right, is the [unclear]. And the concept of their being cost to magic is not new. Like it takes energy to do it, or it takes [unclear]. You know, there\u2019s always some sort of thing it takes to do it. But it pulls from you essentially, like the power you are capable <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">of pulls from you. And everything you have to pay for with some sort of price. And then dark magic is when you make someone else pay the cost for you. It\u2019s like human sacrifice, where you harness their terror and their pain as like this credit that you can use later.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563399\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">But I have this thing where it\u2019s all a basic standard spells the wizards know, right. They\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, these are the things we know how to do. We like throw lightning bolts around and shit like that and whatever. And we practice that stuff.\u201d But there is a talent if people have it where they can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">actually speak magic. You know, the magic they use is kind of this refined like codified, \u201cHere\u2019s how you throw a lightning bolt. But we\u2019ve practiced it enough that like you can just\u2026 if you focus in a certain way, like it\u2019s an easy enough trick to do as you throw it away.\u201d Well, whatever. And so yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">you\u2019re good at that. But they guy is\u2026 he\u2019s like warded against making such simple spells so all the shit\u2019s bouncing off him. So she needs to speak magic at that point, which is like this raw sort of thing. The price for it is that it actually hurts you. Like she\u2019s speaking\u2026 she\u2019s using fire to like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200693\">burn through this sort of shield he has, this ward that exists. But she\u2019s speaking fire as she does. So she starts to speak the words \u201chot\u201d, right, this hot breath that comes through. As she continues to intensify the effect like it starts to blister her lips, you know, as the words come out hotter <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200694\">and hotter. Eventually to the point where she actually chokes on that, that they\u2019re too hot. And which cuts off the supply at that point. At which point he gets to come back at her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: But she\u2019s using that to injure\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: To over\u2026 Yeah, exactly, overpower like his defenses and then kill him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: But she starts to get hurt because of the fire\u2026 the heat of it. [0:12:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. And it\u2019s the price for doing\u2026 for drawing more power, right. If you\u2019ve codified these things they take less power to do, right. The more clearly they\u2019re understood, the more specific the effect, the easier it is to do, it costs less from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: You know. But just sort of like just tapping into the fire hose essentially, you know, of just the torrent of power that exists, the universe, you know. But you have to pay for it. And so she can\u2019t speak fire anymore, she\u2019s passed through kind of the limit for being able to do so. And so it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">ends with him as her\u2014we\u2019re all wizards\u2014that up against her throat against the wall and he\u2019s just mocking her, he\u2019s like, \u201cAll three of you are just like\u2026\u201d Like, \u201cYou did your absolute best, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Like, \u201cThis was\u2026 You gave it everything you had.\u201d And like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t enough. And so he\u2019s really trying to crush her, and she can\u2019t\u2026 she can barely speak above a whisper. But you think of thing as the next words she speaks don\u2019t need to be load, they just have to be sharp. And so she\u2019s whispering these words that are slicing her mouth <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">open from inside, like the tones are cutting her lips and blood is coming out. And this all happens very quickly, and he\u2019s realizing what she\u2019s doing, and then she just screams because her jaw just shatters apart into tons of pieces.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563399\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Her skin stretches.

And then she closes\u2026 then she, you know, bites <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">down hard. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: But at the expense of her own face and mouth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Right.

Everyone uses fire. Fire\u2019s primal, it\u2019s one of our first things, you know. Something that separated us, you know, from everybody else. All of a sudden we could live for the night. [0:18:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Isn\u2019t that what happens in Minecraft, that you would build a fire?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, you need light or the monsters come. And the monsters are always spawning in the dark and you need, that is so important. And I like to live dangerously in Minecraft, I don\u2019t build like\u2026 I build like walls to keep them\u2026 the majority of the things, but there\u2019s open spaces in the walls, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">I don\u2019t build giant gates to go through. And I just set up areas which, you know, should keep monsters from spawning inside the walls, but that doesn\u2019t mean that every now and then a monster doesn\u2019t wander in. And there\u2019s no one else to kill this, you know. Whereas Victor and many other people play <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D52\">the fortress mode, they\u2019re like, \u201cAll our doors are made of iron. And they need like buttons to be pressed to open them. And it\u2019s only open for a brief period of time, you\u2019ve got to rush through,\u201d you know, all these other things. \u201cAnd we have just torches all over the floor, and it looks like shit, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D53\">but whatever.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that, monsters can\u2019t spawn on half slabs, so just make your floor of half slabs, and then light it aesthetically.\u201d You know. Monsters can\u2019t spawn on leaves, so I have an underground tree garden where it\u2019s harvesting leaves and use those as the floor <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D54\">for my entire area. And like, you know, now I have some light, that\u2019s just for effect. Carpets now, so you can just like dig a hole in the ground, put a jack-o\u2019-lantern in the ground which gives off 16 light, and put a carpet over it. Carpets don\u2019t block light sources, and so it looks much better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Then having like a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Then having like those\u2026 like an orange block in the middle of your floor, you know, giving off light. And I\u2019ve just created basically a stone floor, cut a couple holes in and throw some jack-o\u2019-lanterns, then throw a red carpet over most of it. You had this nice little\u2026 it was a nice little <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">hut, you know. And I\u2019d have this polished [unclear]. Hardest thing. [0:20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">But yeah. And like I\u2019ve been working on a project of connecting all the various zones. There\u2019s\u2026 And I\u2019ve got visibility to build a portal to the Nether, which is a realm that is eight times smaller than the regular world, so that you\u2019re taking one step and the others are taking eight steps and you overrule. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">So you can build these gates and link them through the Nether and travel great distances in greatly reduced periods of time. And so since we\u2019ve built all over the map various places I\u2019m now building these gates and connecting them with like really safe railways through the\u2026 through Hell essentially. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB2\">Which [isn\u2019t hampered?] by like these flying demons that throw fireballs at you and these\u2026 all sorts of various creatures.

Exactly. And there\u2019s more complex things. You\u2019re like, okay, these many people polled out of hundred saw the TV ad for this. Well, you know\u2026 so it\u2019s 75 out of 100 saw the ad. And we know that of those 75, 32 of them bought the product. And then from the table then they\u2019re asking you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201D11\">figure out the various probabilities.

And like the fight <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202251\">scene in the end of the book is just between this one imager and another imager who\u2019s trying to assassinate this king, and they\u2019re both imaging poison out of glasses into other things and like trying to track with where\u2019s the poison going, and they\u2019re looking for the gentle disturbances in like liquid <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202252\">levels in bottles and cups that they showed that like something\u2019s been imaged, you know.

And he gets a clever magic system, or the\u2026 [] sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202311\">just wants to write about like courtship customs.

In all his books, yeah. And the customs, he\u2019s very\u2026 he\u2019s very invested in the day-to-day lives of his characters. Right, you know. There\u2019s a whole chapter where he just sets up the fact that this guy is going to build this particular staff out of a particular piece of tree he found. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202351\">first he\u2019s like setting up like tools, and like setting up a shop for it, and just like\u2026 And then he has lunch, you know, and what\u2019s that like, and blah, blah, blah.

Yeah, sure, like [dividing them up?]. Whereas I\u2019ve done very little to describe my characters. You know they\u2019re women. I have images of them in my head. There\u2019s been reference to Erin having a braid, you know, and her hair is dark, right.

And his job is for this mercenary company he keeps track of the history, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2024D1\">he writes down all the stuff that happens. So the books are basically just his journal of everything they\u2019re doing. And he doesn\u2019t describe people. He will occasionally give one trait, like The Lady, this powerful sorceress known as The Lady, you know that she\u2019s beautiful and you know that she has black <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2024D2\">hair. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the only thing you know. You know that there\u2019s a guy named One Eye.

And it\u2019s an interesting choice he made, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202591\">at that late point in the story it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve had our own image, like why are you telling us what you think he looks like?\u201d You know.

Like I just want to like be, here are a few broad strokes of what they look like, and fill in everything else yourself. Because in my mind if it\u2019s a successful young adult trilogy and then make a movie, and I get to be all, \u201cLook, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2025D1\">I set it up so you can be ethnic.\u201d You know, you can cast any ethnicity as any one of these people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025F\">THERAPIST: Mm.

I want detail rights on the casting. I promise to be reasonable, but we\u2019re not casting Tom Cruise as the main character. She\u2019s very clearly a woman. You know. That\u2019s something I like doing, is people don\u2019t write a lot of fantasy <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202691\">about women. Unless it\u2019s like some special thing. You know, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, she is the special lady who knows how to use a sword.\u201d Like, \u201cOh, the special lady who knows how to use a sword. That\u2019s so unconventional.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? Why are we even bothering with this?\u201d In a world where people have <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202692\">magical, fantastical, heroic powers, like that\u2019s the equalizer, right. And your ethnicity, your gender, nothing has anything to do with what you are capable of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like if you\u2019re a wizard who the fuck cares what color you are, what bits you have, you can fucking wield fire from\u2026 you know, like a tool.
