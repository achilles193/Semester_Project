But my landlord was coordinating with Laney about having some people come over to fix it, and they needed someone to let them in. They didn\u2019t have a key. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200971\">And I think there were just too many people talking between too many different people. And yeah, it was just a calamity.

I really appreciated the\u2026 I mean that was\u2026 it was nice to hear because it was, I don\u2019t know, I mean that you didn\u2019t seem pissed off or something. It was nice to read that. You know what I mean? But at the same time in my head I was like oh my God. I mean if you wanted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">talk about it you probably need to have a session and I should, you know what I mean? Just like a text message. I didn\u2019t really know how else to kind of go about talking about it. I was just like yeah, I\u2019m just going to talk about it next time. Yeah, it was just\u2026 oh God it was just such a\u2026 that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B72\">just a stressful day. [11:45] I think I probably did something along those lines afterwards, just got into bed and fell asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Is that right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sometimes I like to do that when I get stressed out. Not usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: What do you feel like in bed? What does that do for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: I get in bed and I just watch something and then just kind of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: What, watch a show or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, something, just what I do to fall asleep usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Oh and you fall\u2026 you try to sleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s usually\u2026 I mean I think [inaudible] long time ago but that\u2019s the only way I really fall asleep.

And then if there\u2019s a noise in the show I\u2019ll\u2026 my eyes might kind of crack open a bit. And then I can kind of shut my computer and fall back asleep. I can if I can kind of stay in the sleep zone. But without <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">that I can\u2019t. I really can\u2019t get to sleep. It used to be that I could get to sleep by listening to podcasts. [] But now I can\u2019t fall asleep unless I have something visual as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Visual, too, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I get, I don\u2019t know, I get uncomfortable when I\u2019m laying in bed without that. Sometimes I can play a game or something and fall asleep but I\u2019ll literally have to be like playing the game and me fall asleep and it drop out of my hand and go to sleep. That\u2019s the\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">that\u2019s been the way it\u2019s worked for a long time. [14:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, something about that\u2026 something that would kind of\u2026 that would be there for you in the absence of all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, I\u2019ll just start getting really anxious. I\u2019ll just start thinking about stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You will. You\u2019d be [inaudible] go over specific things in your mind or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not just a feeling, it\u2019s a\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a\u2026 yeah, I mean it\u2019s both. I mean now it\u2019s\u2026 I would just get uncomfortable, not\u2026 I mean it\u2019s sort of like an addiction in a sense. If I\u2026 I would be uncomfortable if I didn\u2019t\u2026 if I knew that I couldn\u2019t watch something to fall asleep. Even before I actually laid down in bed without it. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB1\">know what I mean? I would start to get anxious about it already. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that? What are you\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I guess I just started thinking about it. I think it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been doing that. I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I could go into my bedroom, get in bed, turn the lights off, and lay there until I fell asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: When you went to the hotel in Vancouver\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Oh we watched something.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s kind of like Laney\u2026 it doesn\u2019t really seem\u2026 Laney can usually\u2026 she can fall asleep on command and say\u2026 when she\u2019s stressed she falls asleep. That\u2019s her escape, which is like\u2026 just as she closes her eyes she\u2019s asleep. It\u2019s just really hard for me to get my head around. I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">imagine doing that. She can fall asleep with something playing very easily. It doesn\u2019t bother her. So yeah, [inaudible] it\u2019s just part of our going to bed routine. I\u2019ll have something on or whatever. Yeah, I mean I don\u2019t know if I could fall asleep in the absence of that. [inaudible] without having <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E72\">talked to her for so long I kind of just thought that\u2019s what everybody did. But it\u2019s weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s almost\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: I imagine there\u2019s a lot of people like that, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s a common thing, I think, that kind of\u2026 I mean it happens for\u2026 a lot of people do describe that. But I think it\u2019s because of the\u2026 I think it\u2019s the\u2026 I mean it\u2019s different. It manifests in different ways where it means different things. But I think there\u2019s something around just the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED1\">focusing your mind away from something about going to sleep. [17:43] And I guess, first of all, that anxiety that\u2019s sort of there. I mean I see it\u2026 yeah, one is a way just to kind of shut off that kind of\u2026 that side of your mind that might be worrying or thinking over things. But I think it\u2019s also kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED2\">of like when people are about to fall asleep that there\u2019s, yeah, that feelings arise in those moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563405\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: It is like some particularly anxious thing about it, impending sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Or it can be.

And she\u2026 you can see the living room from her\u2026 from my dad\u2019s kitchen. So I can always see that she falls asleep at night with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F31\">the TV on. It\u2019s on all night. And I always kind of just notice that. And I always kind of thought to myself oh wow, that\u2019s interesting that\u2026 somebody else who does what I do. And she\u2019s a horribly anxious person. You can see a mile away from her. [19:25] And yeah\u2026 and I don\u2019t know, my dad told me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F32\">she takes Xanax every night before she goes to sleep or something.

I guess just like putting it into words, listening to something, sounds way too innocuous or something. Or just too\u2026 it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t\u2026 if I\u2019m in\u2026 I\u2019m awake before bedtime and I\u2019m at room temperature, whatever that is. You know what I mean? Then bed\u2026 I start getting ready <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201131\">to go to bed. If I\u2026 and let\u2019s say maybe I\u2019m a little bit anxious about something, school or whatever. And [inaudible] can give it five minutes of anxiety. If I went and got in bed and didn\u2019t watch anything, if there wasn\u2019t anything, it\u2019s not like my\u2026 it would just stay at five. It would shoot up to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201132\">something like ten. Whereas even if, in the same period of time, I just didn\u2019t even get in bed, it would probably would\u2019ve stayed at five or something. You know what I mean? It\u2019s not even just a calming thing, it\u2019s\u2026 without it it literally will sort of balloon.

A lot of times after I\u2026 and I have to do\u2026 I\u2019ll go out and have a cigarette <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">or something, or some ice cream or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Well are you saying sometimes it\u2019ll break through anyway, even if you\u2019re watching something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: Sometimes.

[26:32] If it\u2019s just the absence of having this TV or this ritual that I\u2019m used to or if it\u2019s just an act of going to sleep itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Well there\u2019s something.

It\u2019s very kind of, I don\u2019t know. I imagine in my head I feel like a teapot is steaming and whistling or something. You know what I mean? I remember when I first started having to watch TV to fall asleep was right after I got out\u2026 kicked <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F1\">out of school and I was at home. And I remember because I remember for a long time I watched South Park every single night. And I couldn\u2019t fall asleep for a while unless I was doing it. And I remember when I started doing it I was like\u2026 I started noticing then I need to put this on tonight. I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F2\">going to be able to fall asleep without this. I can remember for a while me kind of saying to myself wow, this is a thing that I\u2019m doing now. [28:05] You know what I mean? This isn\u2019t something I used to do. Yeah, and that was in\u2026 that was 2007 and, yeah, so\u2026 this is what I mean, seven years. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F3\">know if I\u2019m\u2026 seems like a long time. Yeah, I guess I would\u2019ve thought that I was\u2026 doing something like that kind of was like stressed out about this day [ph?] with school. Maybe this thing with school kind of deals with itself and then I\u2019ll be able to sleep again like I used to. Now it\u2019s like I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F4\">school is like\u2026 that episode with Providence College is like long gone but it\u2019s still there.

And what I assume then was a lot of feelings around it that were going on that would kind of emerge, really, would open up while you were in bed. Maybe were going on throughout. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201411\">I was thinking about it in terms of you having\u2026 well when you\u2019re in bed you really have time just to reflect on what\u2019s going on inside so much more than you do if you\u2019re kind of busy doing stuff. [29:59] But it also sounded like such a tremendous amount of, what I imagine might have been just a tremendous <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201412\">amount of feeling. Yeah, about something that was evoked by the situation at school but something really deep inside of you that the whole situation kind of triggered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, I mean it was definitely a pretty anxious time.

I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have a sense of what it was but you know what I\u2019m thinking about is that how you often describe not wanting to talk to me about it. Do you remember that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, yeah. I mean I\u2019m just thinking that right now in my head.

I imagine what you\u2026 when you were going through it, and maybe even now to some extent, kind of remembered when you said before listen, I\u2019m not sure I want to get into all that. Well there\u2026 it has to do with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201511\">something about\u2026 a lot of what I hear is a lot of feeling about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean I just feel like I\u2026 it\u2019s done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">THERAPIST: I want to put that to bed, if you will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">CLIENT: Well I feel\u2026 yeah, no, yeah. I mean I felt like it was a horrible situation and all I could do is ride it out. I feel like I rode it out and now I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to think about it anymore. I put up with it for a while and I let it kind of really just suck. [32:26] And all right. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201571\">I did it. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t even have to think about it anymore. It\u2019s absolved itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">THERAPIST: It absolved itself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s gone.

It\u2019s over. It\u2019s\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2019re absolved of your sins or something. It\u2019s [inaudible] I don\u2019t know.

I think, yeah, and in a way I think what I\u2019m wondering if the experience in some ways there\u2019s a topic but there\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201911\">a lot of feeling connected to it or something. [38:18] There\u2019s a\u2026 some kind of, yeah, so I can imagine some way, if that\u2019s the case, that there\u2019s not a sense of well, what do I even talk about here.

Maybe it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B1\">his or it\u2019s that\u2026 I mean it\u2019s almost just like I just genuinely don\u2019t know what I would say.

In a way, when it came to my parents and stuff, that topic, I kind of felt the same way, but I had a kind of want, maybe, on some level to be able to talk about it, think about it in a way that\u2019s complicated and not unqualified or something. But I would\u2019ve liked to have had\u2026 get a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B3\">understanding or work on that topic or something. I don\u2019t even want to\u2026 when it comes to the thing at school, I don\u2019t even have any desire to renegotiate it or change the way that I think about it or relate to it.

I think I told you what I think I heard one person one time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B31\">it was like a social worker or something at Providence College, he used the phrase oblivion seeking behavior.
