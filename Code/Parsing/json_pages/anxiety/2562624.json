Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: So I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about desire and reasons for acting. The things we\u2019ve been talking about. When it comes to here and now, I don\u2019t know what to say. Not that I have nothing to say, just (pause) you can\u2019t fit a lake through a straw, or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">That first moment is (pause), feels sort of like that. Hello? There\u2019s many different things that are all sort of crowded together (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">We talked some about there being a healthy way or an unhealthy way to make essentially any decision. We were talking sort of about a specific one. But a few weeks before you suggested there might be good reasons for acting or bad reasons for acting. We didn\u2019t talk much about what good or bad meant in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">that context, but I don\u2019t know if it needs to be overanalyzed. That whole subject reminded me of a seminar I took in college on practical reason. Are you familiar with that? I think that you majored in philosophy. I guess your website says that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, a very long time ago (crosstalk at 00:03:34). On roles (ph) and all those people, rational. But anyway, it\u2019s a long time ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been a while for me, also. But what constitutes a reason for acting, sort of being one of the main questions in the field. And one of the more convincing answers seemed to be (pause) neglecting moral questions, because they become very challenging in that role. That counts as a reason for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">acting if one has a belief that it will affect a certain end, and has and wants motivational set, a desire for that end. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">The fun part of philosophy is saying things that are fairly straightforward as complicatedly as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: (pause) On the subject of thinking about leaving my wife, it doesn\u2019t seem like a good reason to leave. If I have trust issues\u2014there\u2019s probably a better way to phrase that, but that was the fastest way to say it\u2014the problem is that I am unable to trust people. That really says very little about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">her, or the relationship in terms of how it relates to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">So one approach to the problem is to, sort of say is that the case? You know, I certainly seem to have difficulty trusting people (pause). And then, try to sort that out before I sort out the other questions. Like what do I do in this particular situation? I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really the\u2014that useful <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">of a way to go, but it certainly appeals to my normal instinct to take a problem that exists, or is imposed on me in some way, and figure out what\u2019s wrong with me, and try to fix that. Or to try to do something in the face of a problem that I don\u2019t know what to do about <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">For example, I\u2019ve had several things sitting on my plate for a while. I need to find a job. I\u2019ve been working on this particular paper. I need to finish my dissertation, in addition to the car still broken, and do taxes. Last week I deposited my dissertation, so that\u2019s done. Did our taxes, so it\u2019s sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">of like, in feeling overwhelmed, my response is to find something I can get done, and finish that so I can devote less mental energy to the overwhelmed part of it, and just handle the things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562624\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">You know, it also seems like a bad reason for acting, analogizing that I feel despair in certain types of circumstances. Feeling despair about my relationship does not seem like necessarily a good reason to leave. None of these things say there aren\u2019t good reasons, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">(pause) So that\u2019s some pieces. Do you have any thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: About what you said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, or anything at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m listening to how you\u2019re thinking about it (pause). Do you feel like you need more guidance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: (pause) You know, at the end of the day, I think I want this to be a conversation. If I talk the whole time, I won\u2019t think it\u2019s a conversation. I don\u2019t know if I need more guidance, but I trust you to find the balance in these extremes. If I sit here and talk at you the whole time, most of that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I can do by myself. And I haven\u2019t gained any insight that I didn\u2019t already contain, but my hope is that you have insights into me or will have in the process insights and can help. That doesn\u2019t mean at any given moment you need to have the magic cure, or anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like so far more of one extreme today? Not saying much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that\u2019s often how we start. And I haven\u2019t given you space until I asked, \u201cdo you have any thoughts?\u201d (chuckling) Sometimes you jump in, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Do you feel alone in this decision?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah I do. That\u2019s a really interesting question. Feels like a decision I have to make (pause). And for whatever reason, it\u2019s one that I\u2019m not willing to talk about with almost anyone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(pause) In the last month, you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve talked about it with. So yeah, I guess I do feel alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Are there people you\u2019ve talked with it before then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Not extensively. It\u2019s come up in talking with my parents (pause). Yeah, we haven\u2019t talked about it a whole lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(pause) Yeah, most of that\u2019s because\u2014and I guess I have some reluctance to talk about it with anyone. Because most of the people that I might talk about it with know Tanya, and also care about Tanya <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">(pause) One piece is I feel like\u2014it puts the other person in a potentially difficult spot, having that conversation. You have to take a side (pause). It\u2019s a thing I think about, but is it a thing I\u2019ll actually do? I don\u2019t know. It seems like talking about (chuckling) has the potential to be like a false <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">alarm. I don\u2019t know that I endorse any of the logic, or any of what I\u2019m saying. Just (chuckling) these are more or less some of the reasons why. I don\u2019t know if any of them are good reasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Good, not to talk to other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, the false alarm would only be true if you talking with someone to inform them, versus to engage in a conversation and get feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah (pause). I think that\u2019s an essential part of this conversation that is informative, and I\u2019m thinking about this. That\u2019s a big thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Do you think issues of trust come into it, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course, of course. I think that sort of sensibility is part of why I said I don\u2019t think any of these are good reasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: That you couldn\u2019t trust anyone with this very sensitive information, or very sensitive feelings and thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562624\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right (pause). It\u2019s been a long time, but we\u2019ve talked about this in a context I don\u2019t actually remember, but in the sense of I\u2014there\u2019s a part in which I don\u2019t particularly care about the information, but I don\u2019t necessarily trust people\u2019s responses to it. Trust them to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">be able to handle it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: And how wouldn\u2019t they handle this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: (pause) It seems like it would be upsetting (pause). There\u2019s a sense in which that conflicts with my general goal of needing as little as possible and providing as much as possible to other people, and from. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">Not that I necessarily endorse that goal, either. It seems to lead more or less inevitably with a specific problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Do you think that people would be surprised that you\u2019re thinking about this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know. It came up in talking with my parents. I was talking about some of my frustrations and my dad essentially said you start to ask the question, when do you cut your losses?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s blunt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean it blunt like shocking blunt, but to the point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: (laughing) But for the fairly practical. It\u2019s good, I like blunt. In that sense it was like, much if I express something to you, and you express the desire or thought that I hadn\u2019t said that\u2019s related. It\u2019s sort of like that. Clearly, he was not surprised that this would be a topic of thought. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">But the other thought that I had when you asked that is, not surprised, but disappointed. Like I\u2019m failing somehow in thinking about wanting to leave. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I just think you\u2019re wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019d be very surprised\u2014I mean, we could talk about making a generalization about your friends. But I\u2019d be very surprised if your close friends felt that way. I\u2019d be very surprised. What seems like a big deal to you, of course it\u2019s a big deal. But it would be odd for someone not to know the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">situation and be close to you, and to know how many years you\u2019ve now gone through Tanya with hospitalizations and so forth. And be like yeah, I can imagine that question would cross your mind and you\u2019d be thinking about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">I mean, especially since you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of friends who broke up with people because of that. So I really think the idea of disappointment is a projection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: I wondered which of us was going to say that (pause). Yeah, I think sometimes I am disappointing myself for thinking about it. We\u2019ve talked a lot about disappointment and being disappointed or disillusioned about where my life is, and things that have happened. This sense in which I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">do everything right, or correctly, or well. It doesn\u2019t matter that much on the little things, which is a good thing. To learn something, you have to make a lot of mistakes in doing it, right? At least I do. I don\u2019t want to speak to how you learn things. But it\u2019s hard, you make a lot of mistakes and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">work through it (pause). But on the big things, I want to do it right, or get it correct. This seems like a big thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: (pause) It is (pause) What are you thinking about? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: (pause) I was sort of casting around for what the next step was, and sort of thinking, like, sorry, I feel better than I did when I came in. I feel less alone. And, thank you. But I was also thinking, so, will I leave and talk with any of my friends about this. And it seems unlikely.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562624\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Why? An obvious next question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I wasn\u2019t expecting you to ask it, though (laughing). For the same reasons that we just talked about. I think you\u2019re right that I\u2019m wrong, but that doesn\u2019t\u2014often that will actually change my view or approach, but I\u2019m not sure that...(pause) I feel like something has to be relatively loosely held <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">to change that quickly. These things are not loosely held. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (pause) It feels very real that you disappointed the people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I\u2019m trying to sort out whether that\u2019s the important piece. Certainly what I said makes it sound like it was (pause). Yeah, I\u2019m not quite sure. So, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m unwilling to ask for advice. I\u2019d actually prefer to ask a few friends and family, or someone to talk about major <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">life decisions with me under most circumstances. I find it helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">(pause) So it seems like a conceptually related problem that\u2019s very different is I need to figure out what I want to do as my next job or as my career, and then do it. That seems like an important thing to do, at least financially. But that\u2019s another thing that I\u2019m not really talking with anyone about. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">I think because the conversations tend to be structured like, how is that going? Which, for me, is like asking for a status report, or an update on what the situation is. And the situation is I don\u2019t have a job and I don\u2019t know what I want to do, about which I feel guilty, or whatever the right word <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">in that spectrum is. I can\u2019t keep straight guilt and shame. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">(pause) And there, I think part of the problem is I don\u2019t know anyone who knows enough to help. They serve a question of, like, what are the options? That has to be a part of that. A very practical question of what job will you take, in the short run. And then, in the long run, of what do different <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">careers look like in your field. Well, I\u2019m not friends with very many chemists. So I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s relevant, or a different light on the same problem. I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Do you feel the two are related because you\u2019re feeling kind of stuck in a decision\u2014stuck not knowing what to do about your marriage, that it\u2019s hard for you to figure out what to do next with your career? (pause) Because it sort of falls under the umbrella of what do I do with my life? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">it\u2019s confusing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I definitely think I\u2019d say they\u2019re related. (pause) Yeah, and to return to your earlier question, do I feel alone in that question or decision? I do feel alone in that question, also. What do I do with my life? What should I be doing? I don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s one that someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">else can answer. I have to answer it (pause). So I come and talk with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">We\u2019re in this place where I don\u2019t expect you to actually answer the question. But I find it helpful to talk with you, and hopeful that I will eventually find an answer. And a little scared that I won\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: That you won\u2019t make a decision, or that you won\u2019t\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Oh, I mean, a decision will eventually get made. I guess by me or by circumstances. But that I won\u2019t find an answer to \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562624\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I guess in part it depends on how you define what an answer is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I guess so. (pause) You know, you, from several sessions, might respond\u2014well, several sessions a guy might respond (ph) you need to decide what you want to do, which I think (pause) captures a large amount of truth, in very few words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">(pause) But then we\u2019ve come back to the question of what do I want? Which is a question that (pause), is both very hard for me, and about which I have a hard time trusting other people to talk about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">(pause) You suggested some time ago that something like that might related to (pause) you know, receiving a lot of positive feedback at being intelligent, or successful, or whatever, when I was younger. As if I felt that people liked me because I was this particular thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">(pause) Yeah, and in fear of misrepresenting what you said, I lost the second part of what I was going to say. Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">(pause) I think it goes something like, if people like me for some set of positive attributes that they know I present in one way or another, I don\u2019t have a very good sense of how they will respond or feel about me if they know what I want. Of course, that\u2019s all tangled up in I\u2019m not exactly clear what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">I want, either. But even if in particular cases where it is clear, it\u2019s not\u2014I don\u2019t necessarily feel okay about expressing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: (pause) I had a couple of different thoughts. Like, one thought, sort of to be blunt like your dad is: I don\u2019t want to see you get stuck. Like, I feel like you don\u2019t need to decide tomorrow what you\u2019re going to do about your marriage. And you are engaging in the question, but it\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">important to continue to engage in it. And I can see how other things that really are more time-sensitive can start to get wrapped up in it. Like getting a job. You don\u2019t have to get a job tomorrow, but, you should\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: \u2014you should be actively engaged in it. And so, I\u2019m concerned that things could start to grind to a halt because there\u2019s so much that feels unknown. And grinding to a halt, that process in itself, can be problematic. Making a decision isn\u2019t as imperative I think as being engaged to it. At <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">some point, making a decision is important, but being engaged in it. And I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not, I mean I think you are (chuckling). But, you know, there\u2019s a way\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: No, I think that\u2019s helpful. Sort of (ph) to say, like the important part of making a decision, the final step is all of the steps up to it. I have to keep making in order to get to the final step, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And I know I bring this up every few months, and I need to think about the what it means beyond the practicality of it. But I do think, you know, your coming in at least another time a week to, like, roll our sleeves up. Like, all this is really important. And I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">something, by a long shot. But why don\u2019t we do more of it if it\u2019s helpful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">Then I started to think about A, the complication I\u2019m going to be out for a number of weeks, and I\u2019m, you know, appreciative of that. And then, all the other things that came up the last time we talked about it. Your fears of depending on me, maybe some fears of the intensity of the feelings you might <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">have if we met more frequently. There\u2019s a lot wrapped up in it. That is as important as your engaging in these decisions. That was sort of my thought process as I was listening to you talk. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562624\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: (pause) I appreciate the directness. So (pause), I\u2019m actually not concerned about the intensity of feelings, or about the dependency. I was very concerned about both of those things. But I feel like the intensity of feelings, like I was\u2014(pause) in retrospect, I think it was tied up in some combination <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">of trust and fear of positive feelings associated with, like, Tanya\u2019s a person that I love, and have love, and perhaps have loved more in the past than I do now. That\u2019s caused a lot of pain, also. There\u2019s sort of a...(pause) I was also\u2014I think I was scared that I would, like, fall in love with you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A52\">But I think that was also tangled up in this I do love you, but I\u2019m not in love with you. Those are sort of different forms of the emotion. So those were all snarled up. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve picked them up clearly just now. So I guess I\u2019m not. The answer to why not is, like, I really can\u2019t afford to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A53\">do it financially. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Which leads into the part of the issue of coming more frequently, you know, figuring out what you want to do so you can get a job, so you can have more money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: (laughing) Right, which is sort of the snarl that most of my life is in right now, right? Do A to do B to do C. But C depends on, or impacts what you do for A.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Well, if that\u2019s really the only reason, I would certainly, at least for a period of time, be open for a nominal fee for this. Nominal already makes it sound\u2014devalues it. But a small fee for the second session. If zero dollars is what you can do, a smaller fee with the audio recording, I\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">be open to that. Especially for a short period of time until you figure out what you\u2019re going to do next. So, I\u2019d certainly just want to put that on the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Thank you. I seem to have a difficult time accepting aid, so, there\u2019s that hurdle also. But that\u2019s probably one that we should talk about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I take good care of myself in many different ways. I wouldn\u2019t offer that if I weren\u2019t serious about that. Like, if I felt uncomfortable about that or felt whatever, I would not offer that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Thank you. So I feel like a thing that I need to do is, sort of figure out what I could afford. And think if there\u2019s a question that comes up. Because if you\u2019re going to be gone for six weeks, normally I would be paying you during that time anyway. Would you be open to deferred payment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: That I certainly would be open to. That\u2019s not a problem. We can figure out that piece. I don\u2019t know exactly how the math goes, but that would be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, sort of like, that\u2019s money I would be paying you, but I\u2019d be paying it to you in June or July. So I don\u2019t have it now, if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m really, like, just saying we have ten weeks before I go on maternity leave. I would be fine taking that six weeks for the ten weeks, for example. That would be okay with me. In other words, you\u2019d be paying a little bit less per session, because we have more sessions and I\u2019ll be gone. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">But that would be okay with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Okay (pause). I can clearly do that financially, so, I guess I would like to see you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562624\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Okay, well do you want to figure out another time?

Whatever works for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: If you have\u2014I mean, we\u2019re running against time here, so if you\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t we do it by e-mail?
