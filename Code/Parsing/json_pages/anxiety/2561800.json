AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: Ok, this is session 10: Monday the sixth of January, 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Hi Jessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Hi Debbie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s been a few weeks since we met. Our last session was last year !!!, meaning December, prior to this holiday period. When we finished off in our last session, your homework was to be a completed self-help form rather than more than one form. You said that you would do one ABC form thoroughly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">and mindfully and so \u2026. (pause) you look a bit emotional at the moment\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yes, you\u2019re not? Your eyes seemed to \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It\u2019s my eye makeup running<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: So is that what it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Maybe, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So that was the homework and another task was for you to find a photo of yourself as a child and \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It found me<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: It found you? I\u2019m really looking forward to hearing about that. The main tasks were your doing the ABC form, thoroughly, mindfully, not just getting it done and over with because it was homework, and to find the photo of you as a child so you could mindfully consider having an attitude to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">yourself, now, these days with these challenges that you\u2019re enduring, which can remind you to be as gentle to yourself at present as you would be to a child. To remain mindful and keep things in perspective. Another of the things that we were talking about in one of the later sessions of last year was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">the wise thing that you did one night when you couldn\u2019t sleep. Instead of lying there stewing and thinking over and over, \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t sleep\u201d... you looked at a video of a friend of yours who passed away from cancer, you said you did so because the video of her shows life and spirit and upliftment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">That\u2019s a brief recapping of recent sessions and the homework tasks that we had spoken about. So, please if you would tell me how much, or little, or not all, you did you did of the homeworks and anything else you want to say to bring us up to date. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Sure. Sure. So the first thing in terms of the homework, I did a little bit on my computer and I did some in my notebook. I did a lot in my notebook actually and I am very, I am a little disgruntled right now because I went to my girlfriends for the holiday and I have a feeling an inkling that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">it might be there. But I\u2019m not 100 % sure only because she had a suitcase, because she only comes every other week, I started to do it on the computer the other night when I realize I didn\u2019t have it and totally forgot to ask her if she had seen it but now thinking back she still has one suitcase in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">her car from the week before and I believe it might be in there. The notebook, which I would be upset if I don\u2019t have because I wrote A LOT in there. That\u2019s just a side note. That has nothing to do with the homework not being done, because I can tell you right now I did do the homework and in fact some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">today that I did thoroughly. So it\u2019s not about not doing the homework, it\u2019s about the fact that I wrote some really personal things in there (laughing) and I don\u2019t know where that note book is at the moment. So, I could pull up the computer, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really totally necessary because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200254\">did attack one, one activating event very thoroughly, if that helps. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yes, okay, so did you find that you did successfully apply yourself, particularly to the area that in the past that you have said was not all that comfortable for you \u2013 the disputing. Did you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes, so here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting, I don\u2019t think that in my life I ever really been challenged in the way that I\u2019ve been challenged more recently, which I have mentioned, I don\u2019t have to get into it again, with just having to make this big decision about surgery and it\u2019s up to me, that there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">lots of pain, and it\u2019s a lifestyle decision, that the surgeons would operate, but that it so something that is lifestyle. And I think that growing up, and I do have to go back to that only because I sort of have been in this little bubble of not really having to challenge or thinking that I had to challenge <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">anything that was said to me in my past from my parents. And so growing up in that sort of fashion, yes I have a job now, and yes I do all these things, but I didn\u2019t have the opportunities to dispute. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">In all honesty up until quite recently, like I would say more in the last few times of doing the homework, it did come more naturally; like wait a second \u2013 you actually can dispute, you don\u2019t just have to jump to the anxious feeling, I hate to be so dramatic or extreme, but that is what I really have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">tended to do, without realizing it. Without knowing, so to answer your question, I don\u2019t think it very naturally came to me to dispute at all and I would sit there and it was almost like, something that is so not natural, anything that you do in life that doesn\u2019t feel right because it\u2019s not coming to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">you automatically or easily. A homework assignment, when you\u2019re little and your teacher gives you homework, and they are saying like go home and do this calculus assignment and you can\u2019t do it and you\u2019re like no matter what I do I cannot do it. And then finally after trying and trying and trying the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">light bulb goes off \u2013 wait a second I can do it. And then it starts to come more naturally and of course you still have to practice it, but at least that thought of \u2018wait a second I can actually do this without somebody guiding me and sitting on top of me, 24\/7\u2019 : that piece of it then starts to come. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B4\">Then you can pass the test, and then you can maybe even start to get a 100. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">So I almost feel like I haven\u2019t been able to do that up until the more recent times. It felt a little forced, NOW it doesn\u2019t, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It makes sense and it\u2019s good to hear of that change, that progress you are making over time. But it sounds to me like you might have held a very unrealistic expectation, and I hope as your therapist, I didn\u2019t misguide you in any way, to think that the changes would or could come naturally. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">Of course \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I thought that that did come naturally. Well because I was in therapy. So I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You refer to the therapy with someone else, in the past?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: In the past yes. And I\u2019m a guidance counselor. So again it goes back to my expectations, but I thought if I had counseling in the past, if I was in a master\u2019s program to get counseling, because we had to do that in order to get our degree, and then I was thinking if I do counseling all day long <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">with students how is it that this work on my stuff would be so difficult? That was the expectation. That it wouldn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: And what\u2019s the answer now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: The answer is that this is something that I never did before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: So why would it be easy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yes, why would it feel \u201cnatural\u201d to do things differently \u2013 to use the word you used before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. But that wasn\u2019t the expectation. You\u2019re right the expectation, was no, this should be something that I should know how to do. It was all about the \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: The should were in your own head, and you put them there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: In my own head and I was confused. But I was genuinely confused. Genuinely confused as to why something therapeutic, that I ALWAYS, there I\u2019m quoting that word because it is so extreme. Something that always came so naturally to me in school and my class when I graduated top of the class, no <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">I\u2019m joking! (laughing) and all my teachers loved me and said you\u2019re going to be an amazing counselor, I thought these weeks, how can I not even get these REBT concepts? That was sort of what I was thinking in my head. I no longer think that, But I DID think that when we first began.  So, that\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">what I have now, at all, this is a completely different, it might be within the therapeutic umbrella but it\u2019s a very different, it\u2019s like being trained in something that I was never trained in before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Correct!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: So, I\u2019m enjoying it now instead of being hard on myself when I do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Or feeling you need to do it perfectly well, or not at all. So that\u2019s interesting for us to view as we look in the rear vision mirror the way you imposed on yourself that expectation of it needing to come naturally, and I am pretty certain that I would not have said to you \u201cJessa do this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">a few times and it will feel natural\u201d. I don\u2019t believe I did that !<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: No, you never said that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So, I am not being critical of you here. We\u2019re just viewing what had been your experience, and what you\u2019ve just shared, and it\u2019s good for us to put the magnifying glass on it, because if you are aware of the tendencies that can come easily because you\u2019ve practiced them unchecked for many, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">many years \u2013 it makes it easier to change them if you so choose. Knowing that that tendency to think that if you have done well at things before, it will feel natural to change behavior sooner. No. With practice, the changes can feel more NATURAL!! Over time. Though it\u2019s not natural, it can feel more <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">familiar with more practice. You can either do preventative work or catch unhelpful thoughts sooner and dispute and then change them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">So, it is good to be aware of how even with REBT, and even with the probability that I shared with you that over time change can happer, this is something unfamiliar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Unfamiliar, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: It will require work and practice, disputing your NEED to do it right, to do it perfectly, even given the fact that you are extremely bright and have been very successful in many things. Those needs are inhibitors. And the good news is your telling me that\u2019s no longer the case that you unthinkingly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">succumb. Well done. So, we\u2019re fast forwarding to 2014, YAY! Happy New Year!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes, Happy New Year!<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: And so you did the ABC form, and you feel more comfort in the disputing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: I do, I do. I have one question that I think is important. Because where I\u2019m still struggling and we can talk about the ABC\u2019s, is I do get and again this might not be related to REBT specifically, but I get chest pain at times, like the free floating anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I was about to say what corner of the room is it on right now, has it \u201cfloated\u201d to the ceiling? (Joking tone).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: (Laughter).Well I call it free floating only because I have tried when I have those moments, and a lot of times its more at night where I\u2019ll get anxious, just more at night I would say, not, but maybe it\u2019s during the day, and I might not be as aware of it, but when its dark and its late and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">I\u2019m by myself <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Less distraction at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Less distracted, exactly, exactly \u2013 less distracted. I\u2019ll get that. So, with that said, I\u2019ve tried to, I\u2019ve actually thought what are the \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d? I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ve actually done that, where I\u2019ll swear I\u2019m struggling and I would love to get help with this, is that once I sometimes get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">I\u2019m going to call it anxiety because that really is what it is, it\u2019s a \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: When you feel anxiety\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Feel anxiety, yeah, oh not \u201cget\u201d anxiety. Oh, when I FEEL anxiety because the feeling is so powerful. To me it is when my heart is racing and I\u2019m having difficulty breathing and all of that and that when that feeling of panic sets in, what I find difficult, is once that feeling sort of sets <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">in, or all the symptoms, let\u2019s call them the symptoms. The difficulty breathing, the chest pains, chest tightness all of that, I then have a very difficult time even being, like what\u2019s the, then my mind I feel like is going here and here and here, once that feeling actually comes on and so to calm my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">body down, I feel like I need to do that first before I then look at what the thoughts are because the feeling, I don\u2019t, I\u2019m a (stumbles) And then I\u2019m sounding like I\u2019m trying to be a, to connect neurons and (sigh) \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: No, No, No, I don\u2019t recommend you do that if you are experiencing those physical symptoms, just as if someone creates rage within themselves it would be a most unrealistic expectation to suggest to them when they\u2019re in the peak intensity and heat of the rage, to ask themselves \u201cso now what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">am I telling myself to make myself enraged?\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: So, it\u2019s a very helpful rational strategy to calm yourself, to calm your breathing, relax your body... before identifying the thoughts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how to though, that\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t want to cut you off, but that\u2019s the issue I\u2019m having.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Well then we\u2019ll talk about it now, the How-to calm yourself, so that you get yourself to the place of doing the cognitive investigation. So \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: So in other words you can\u2019t ever be expected to do the investigation, you\u2019re agreeing that when you\u2019re in that sort of symptomatic state with all the you know, the breathing issues and all that, it\u2019s very hard to<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: I would not say, never, as there may be some people who get to the point after a long time of practicing REBT where by just remembering \u201coh, I have this tool that\u2019s helped me so much in the past \u2013 what am I telling myself\u2026\u201d , it might work for some.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: However, I can totally understand that in these early days for you of applying REBT, it\u2019s not working like that and so I fully encourage you to do something healthy to calm yourself and your body. I say healthy, as opposed to someone doing something like having a drink or doing something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">else to distract themselves that really isn\u2019t therapeutic or healthy, that isn\u2019t for their well-being, it\u2019s JUST a distraction. But you know, I\u2019ll throw out a few healthy things that could be done, and you tell me which, if any of them might work for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: When you are in the grip of that physical sensation of shortness of breath and tightness or pain in the chest and so forth, one reminder to yourself might be thinking:\u201d I\u2019ve gone through this before, and I\u2019m going get through it again. And I\u2019m going to calm myself down because whatever is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">going on it isn\u2019t the end of the world\u201d. Tell yourself soothing thoughts, \u201cThis too will pass, I can endure this\u201d in other words, and tell yourself: \u201cIn some moments when I\u2019ve calmed down, I\u2019m going figure out what I thought to contribute to the anxiety\u201d. Calm yourself. Calm. Just as you would encourage <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D2\">a child who\u2019s afraid. So, no reprimanding yourself No thinking: \u201cOH God, I\u2019m doing this again, no, no, no or I can\u2019t stand it! Oh I\u2019ll never feel better, it\u2019s like Oh! Oh here I am again!!!\u201d \u2013 Soothe yourself, remind yourself it\u2019s going to be all right. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten through this before and when I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D3\">calmed down I\u2019ll feel better and steady\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: I like that, the reason that doesn\u2019t completely resonate is because of what I\u2019ve decided is that this a lot of this all surrounds sleep. It all surrounds sleep. I don\u2019t really get that panicky, in other words my, what I tell myself is if you don\u2019t get enough sleep, something very bad is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">to happen to you. This is what I, I don\u2019t say this when I\u2019m being rational during the day, it\u2019s at night because I would go nights sometimes, being awake, awake, awake and not getting sleep and then it affects me the next day, how I work, my mood and then it becomes like almost like cyclical. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Now we\u2019ve talked about this before,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: I know we did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: You tended to catastrophize about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: I do, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: And then you feel anxious about the anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Exactly anxiety, it\u2019s about the anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And that gets you nowhere.

The reality is, it may be more of a struggle than if you had gotten a good night\u2019s sleep, but can you get NO productive work done even with little sleep? I doubt it. You may not enjoy <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">the day as much, but you know what? Worst case scenario, so, you don\u2019t have a great day, just like you don\u2019t if you get the influenza virus, you know it doesn\u2019t mean for the rest of your life you\u2019re doomed ! It may be a negative outcome as a result of insufficient sleep. But telling ourselves, we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">not going to cope or \u201cit\u2019s terrible\u201d, exacerbates the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Makes it worse I know!

Instead of going over and rehashing everything I\u2019ve did or didn\u2019t do, right or wrong in my life. In fact what\u2019s important to mention <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">here is I did go back to my diary \u2013 I had a consistent diary that I kept when I lived abroad over a decade ago. And it was just interesting to go back and read it because it was consistent, it was pretty much every day where I wrote in a diary and it was ALL the complete opposite of what we do with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A72\">REBT. It was very much the \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d with me not knowing it, and I read it and I said WOW, this is 15 years ago and that was how I was thinking and it came up in every, it was good to see the consistency because it wasn\u2019t like I just had a bad day and I thought in that way, it was pretty much my way <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A73\">of thinking all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Your habit; your habitual way of thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: I only brought that up because I thought that was important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to justify it. Notice that you are, however back to the recent question I asked (client talking in background), which was how do you create your guilt? So you see, it\u2019s by you damning yourself for not doing what you tell yourself that you \u201cshould\u201d be doing according to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">gospel of Jessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yep!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: So you see how self-defeating that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: It is, it is, it\u2019s completely debilitating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re willing to keep working at changing it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Preventing it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yes, yes I am very much.

So \u2013 I want us to complete, before going on to anything else, discussing a strategy that you can use if you find that you\u2019ve created anxiety and panic about not sleeping enough, or about anything in fact. Choosing a strategy that you can be conscious of, and apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: I would love that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: To address that panic at the time you feel it, so you can lessen it to the degree that you can then apply REBT to further lessen it. SO, that\u2019s what I want to discuss in a moment, after that let\u2019s go back to talking about your homework, the example of the ABC that you\u2019ve got today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Ok, ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: SO \u2013 tell me if you can what you think would work for a small child in your care who was, let us say, sleeping over at your home, who came to you heart racing and breathing quickly and saying \u201cI\u2019m so nervous, I\u2019m so afraid, I\u2019m so anxious Jessa What, what can I do?\u201d How might you soothe that child?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s exactly what I tell the students that come to me when they are anxious during the day. Not necessarily when they are anxious at night. What I generally tell them is that, because what I see is that they\u2019re putting pressures in some way, or expectations on themselves, when they\u2019re in that state.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: You wouldn\u2019t tell the child that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: No, no, no, no, no, No I don\u2019t tell them that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: What would you tell the child?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: I\u2019m saying, what I NOTICE in them, so then what I say to them, whether it works or not and they seem to like it, is I say how old are you? And then they\u2019ll tell me, because I only work with kids up to 5 -10, in the range of 5-10, so they\u2019ll usually say their age is 5,6 7, 8, 9 or 10 and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">I\u2019ll say you\u2019ve only been on the planet for what, like eight years? or whatever it is, and they\u2019ll say yeah, and I\u2019ll say in those eight years what did you do so wrong that you need to beat yourself up? I like make it light with them and they say, nothing, and I say that\u2019s exactly right, you\u2019re a child <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D12\">and you don\u2019t have to worry, you don\u2019t have to have those worries and you can just be a kid.

And I show <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">them that now what they are doing to themselves by torturing themselves basically if that\u2019s what it is, is not matching up to whatever the action was that they did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s disproportionate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s disproportionate to whatever the action was or wasn\u2019t and then the other thing is, what I do tell them, is they\u2019re a child and that they\u2019re learning. If they do make a mistake they have the ability to be able to reflect on it. I\u2019m not as nice as that to myself, I don\u2019t feel <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Oh, you don\u2019t say!

No I\u2019m saying because I don\u2019t know, because usually people say if you are very kind to yourself you help them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Oh!

Because even when I looked <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F53\">back in my journal, that is what it always was. I was always told YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG. Whether it was something right or something wrong or there wasn\u2019t even a right or wrong in that situation, it wasn\u2019t let\u2019s sit down and talk about it, it was you did something wrong. So, looking at these children <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F54\">I work with, and being able to help them as much as I do, I sometimes think that I\u2019m able to do that as well as I do and I feel confident that I can help the kids because I treat them how I wish, I WISH, I definitely feel like I am getting upset but, I feel like I treat the young children that I work <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F55\">with the way that I just wish somebody would have treated me, and I don\u2019t feel like I ever go that, like (starting to cry) that experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t, from what you tell me, you didn\u2019t get that experience, that\u2019s the reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: But I STILL don\u2019t!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Then you STILL don\u2019t from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">CLIENT: I get it from others, I know I do but its not the same as from parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">THERAPIST: And even when you get the support from others, I wouldn\u2019t want you to rely on that in order for you to feel good enough.

YOU didn\u2019t ruin it. We are not here to spend time now figuring them out, we\u2019re looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D1\">at them in relation to how YOU are allowing the behavior they did in the past, and still can tend to do, to affect you NOW. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: And really it is up to you to work on not letting it affect you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case Debbie, I really, that\u2019s why I want help.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: You wish that what wasn\u2019t the case?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: That I DIDN\u201dT allow them to affect me the way that they do.

You are not a failure because you haven\u2019t done it yet. You can never be a failure. You can fail at some things but until recently from what you\u2019re telling me you haven\u2019t even thought about some of the things that our sessions have brought to light, have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201191\">brought to your awareness. So, its early days of your use of REBT. I might say to you Jessa, just as you would say to one of your students, how long have you been in this REBT world? And you might say two months (both laughing) \u2026 I might be saying, well little baby girl (laughing) how could you be expected <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201192\">to do it perfectly? You couldn\u2019t. And by the way, I\u2019ve had some clients who have come over a period of years and made steady progress. But it\u2019s not the case that overnight there was a massive transformation in them. AND I have also had clients who have made massive transformations in a short time. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201193\">different for each one of us, and what I am NOT willing to do is to say that there is a certain time period by which you should achieve so and so. Steady progress is good, and right now we\u2019re bringing to light something that has been an obstacle for you \u2013 which is very helpful. With awareness, you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201194\">change it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s an obstacle yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: And, your habitual tendency to be rougher on yourself than you are to practically anyone else in your life \u2013 that is helpful to observe. So what\u2019s the action required unless you want to keep living in this pain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t, no I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want the pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: Is the remedy for you having willingness to be kinder to yourself and to soothe yourself<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: In the way you do with others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: And then after you have done that, calmed yourself, you can get your detective hat out and say \u201cWell look how I created this anxiety\u201d, identify the irrational beliefs, and get to disputing them. So there\u2019s a solution if you\u2019re willing to be easy on yourself. What\u2019s happening right now for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just listening to you and I appreciate it because I do see the connection, and I see that unfortunately I think where it\u2019s more of an obstacle is that I am close with my family and that I do want that relationship with them but yet I find it challenging because what I\u2019ve tried to do is back <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B1\">away a little bit when I know that they are criticizing me, and I see that doesn\u2019t really work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: You mean you tried seeing them less?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Either see them less, you know \u2013 stay over less. I haven\u2019t really gone there in a while but like when I did I used to think \u201cOh go and sleep over\u201d and you know do all that and I would get excited, I don\u2019t know, and you know just have less or talk to them less about different things and I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F1\">don\u2019t, those haven\u2019t really, those solutions haven\u2019t, they haven\u2019t been solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: Why? It is good for us to look at that. Why haven\u2019t they worked? Let\u2019s get clear about why they haven\u2019t worked so we can get clear on what can work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Sure, sure, sure. So, should I use an example maybe, and figure it out that way? Because I don\u2019t know that. I would say the reason is, because no matter what \u2026 no I know why, I don\u2019t have to use an example. Because no matter what I do, my parents and the way that they are is that their tendency <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201331\">is to be more, more up and then they can be down. A little bit this and then that, sometimes they\u2019re in a good mood and I get a good reaction out of them, sometimes they\u2019re in a bad mood and I get a bad reaction. So it\u2019s a little<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: So are you basing your comfort on their moods?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s what I was gonna, that was what I was gonna say. So let me say that because that\u2019s what I think it is. So what happens in turn is that I base whatever if they say, ooo my little pooboo, my little, which happens, they say right my special angel who is so wonderful, how are you feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201371\">today? And then I would walk away and I\u2019d say W E L L my parents think I am okay. Wow. I\u2019m 35 and I\u2019m still looking for that approval, and I love it \u2013 that approval and it feels great! And they love me and how great how I feel. Within 20 minutes I could get another phone call \u201cJessa\u201d \u2013 and say something <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201372\">like:\u201d not now this is ridiculous, I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019ve asked me this question, I don\u2019t even know why you care, you\u2019re ridiculous and I don\u2019t have the time for this\u201d. Ok. So that can all happen within 20 minutes, it\u2019s like living with an alcoholic. And they\u2019re both kind of seemingly like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201373\">in their own way, both mom and dad. So, what I, what my tendency is, I get that from them \u2013 changeability and all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: You mean, what your tendency has been till now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: Has been, that I get THAT reaction and then I take it on. So, instead of saying \u201coh that\u2019s them\u201d and that\u2019s you know, how they\u2019re being and they\u2019re in a bad mood because of XYZ and that has nothing to do with me, or you know, what have you, I then in turn reflect it 100% on me, not even 90% <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B1\">, and think I have done something wrong or not well enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: You are blaming yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: Well I blame myself for it. And then I feel guilty for inconveniencing them because they don\u2019t want to hear it at that moment. So I will then in turn torture myself just based on their reaction, whereas if I have a very positive you know, you know situation, for instance you know, and they cute <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F1\">talk to me my little, my little booboo where are you? I love you I can\u2019t stop thinking about you sending you love\u201d. Sounds a little crazy and cuckoo but that is what I get from them, right. OH \u2013 wow I\u2019m so emotional I have been trying, it\u2019s like a tight rope, after I tried to balance my emotional <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F2\">sort of temperature so that I don\u2019t get affected by that text message or phone call from them, but then, and I can do that when it\u2019s the I love you\u2019s and not get so affected, but then when it\u2019s the opposite, I have a hard time with that.  So, I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t get so, taken by those <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F3\">types of comments from them, you know, \u201coh you\u2019re my baby and my special one\u201d, and I have been able to distance from that and take the emotion out of it but I\u2019m having a very hard time doing it when it\u2019s the opposite, when its beating me up over this or that. Why, probably, because that happens more. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F4\">This probably happens a lot more than, AND it\u2019s not rational. I mean there\u2019s nothing rational about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2013E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20141\">THERAPIST: BUT you\u2019re acting as if it is, you\u2019re taking it seriously<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20143\">CLIENT: Yes.

I\u2019m starting to see Debbie and that has given me hope, I\u2019ve had a lot of progress with this \u2013 I see that they don\u2019t know all and I don\u2019t look now at them as the perfect people I thought they were when <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201431\">we started REBT. So I see there has been a lot of growth and there has been a lot of change, I just think that as humans things are complicated and it doesn\u2019t always come so (snaps her fingers) like that.

That\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20149\">THERAPIST: We were talking about your saying that you were not feeling familiar with, or comfortable with, the process of disputing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014B\">CLIENT: No I, no, no, No I was, NO I said earlier, I said that it WAS getting, getting better for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">THERAPIST: When we were talking about your giving yourself a hard time, last year,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">CLIENT: Oh, yes, \u2013 I got you, I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">THERAPIST: It seems there has been progress with regard to your taking your parents off the platform of deities, and you are willing to start to see them as humans, fallible humans, as each one of us is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">CLIENT: Fallible, yeah no absolutely, I see growth and progress within myself, I think where, where, where I still continue to struggle is, is that, I think two sessions ago, not like the last session we had but maybe it was the one we had before, we did talk about sleep and I remember that you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201531\">you had said that if you don\u2019t sleep or you even said it today, that it is not the end of the world. But I guess I look differently at, at sleep, because I feel like sleep is the best gift that we can ever, I feel like it\u2019s a present, so then I feel like I\u2019m taking it away, the gift, when I don\u2019t sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201532\">enough. I truly, if I think about any gift we\u2019re given that\u2019s a NATURAL gift, like a natural born gift, is that we all have the ability to sleep and so, when I don\u2019t \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">THERAPIST: But if we all had the ability to sleep then we\u2019d all sleep!

I can\u2019t remember a single night during that period <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2016D1\">in which I didn\u2019t get woken up by his groans rom feeling pain, or his needing something. I might have slept 45 minutes then woken, then I would try to soothe him or stroke him gently or give him something, and then I would lie down again. The fact of the matter is, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, not getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2016D2\">a full night\u2019s sleep undisturbed for 15 months, it wasn\u2019t healthy however my choice at that time was to put up with the sleep deprivation as best that I could, or not STAY with him. I chose to be with him. I would not have wanted it differently \u2013 I chose to be with him. And you know what? I survived. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2016D3\">Even if I\u2019m somewhat functional now (laughing) maybe I would be a girl genius if I had gotten more sleep but I don\u2019t think so!

You might be crabby even if you do get eight hours of sleep, you know, so just sort of talking to myself and being kind to myself and saying, let\u2019s not, you didn\u2019t do anything so terribly wrong, because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202131\">look at it as that\u2019s a good way of punishing..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20215\">THERAPIST: In the PAST you\u2019ve looked at it<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20217\">CLIENT: In the past I\u2019ve looked at it as a way<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20219\">THERAPIST: SO now you\u2019re determined to do what ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2021B\">CLIENT: To be kinder to myself and \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2021D\">THERAPIST: As you would be to a child<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2021F\">CLIENT: As I am with the kids that I work with, students yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20221\">THERAPIST: After our session today, would you be willing to write down some of the things that were meaningful from our session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20223\">CLIENT: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20225\">THERAPIST: Particularly write down what you will say to yourself more or less, not verbatim. If you are experiencing those panic symptoms, be it from insufficient sleep, or you are awake or for any other reasons, write down the thoughts connected to it. Sometimes you felt panic, according to what <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202251\">you\u2019ve told me in the past, not related to that \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20227\">CLIENT: Not related to what?

I would be happy to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20231\">THERAPIST: Ok. So, we don\u2019t have a lot of time left in this session, but do you feel complete with what we looked at?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20233\">CLIENT: I do, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20235\">THERAPIST: Step one: Soothing yourself and talking yourself out of panic, and then applying the REBT steps, disputing and replacing irrational thoughts. This relates to what you shared before, and thinking that you can\u2019t adequately do the REBT when feeling panicked, and I agreed that may at times be <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202351\">the case. Not necessarily that you can\u2019t do it, but that it may be more difficult to go through the first steps with yourself till you have calmed yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20237\">CLIENT: Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20239\">THERAPIST: Alright,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2023B\">CLIENT: Yeah, they\u2019re easy to do. Not very easy but, I\u2019ll do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Even if now it is not very easy but \u2013 is it do-able for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2023F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s do-able<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20241\">THERAPIST: And the more you do it, the easier it will become.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20243\">CLIENT: Ok. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20245\">THERAPIST: But, I\u2019m not going say how soon it becomes easy, it is different for each person, you can tell me how it becomes easier as you keep on making effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20247\">CLIENT: Of course! Of course, I\u2019ll let you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20249\">THERAPIST: As time rolls on. Ok so the second thing we were going to look at was the ABC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2024B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m excited to share it because I feel like this was the first time I was able to dispute and dispute and dispute. I used to get stuck! In the past I would get stuck at that, I wrote down the A, would love writing down all the B\u2019s(making a sound) irrational beliefs. I didn\u2019t have the paper with <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2024B1\">me, so I didn\u2019t remember what that was called but I knew it was that C were the consequences when I tell myself all that, but that was the irrational belief. And then I would get to the disputing and I would feel stuck. Today that was NOT the case when I did it, so I was excited and happy that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2024B2\">I felt like I crossed a new, went over to a new side. Ok. So, should I share? (clearing throat)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N2024A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2024A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Please: share. (no shoulds !)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2024F\">CLIENT: So the activating event is I am in a tremendous amount of pain, I have been. And have been seeking to find appropriate medical professionals for months. I finally found one surgeon who I liked and was ready to schedule the surgery when some of the pain decreased and things weren\u2019t as inflamed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N2024F1\">Its nerve pain, so some went down. And I have been keeping a journal and you just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be. The consequences because of that; here I am ready to schedule surgery with this surgeon, fear, anxiety, worries of pre-regret, I haven\u2019t even had the surgery yet and I\u2019m already thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N2024F2\">that I\u2019m going to regret the surgery. And concerned about making a mistake, if I go ahead and do it, looking back and saying why did I do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20251\">THERAPIST: Fear and anxiety are the unhealthy negative emotions. Concern is actually a healthy negative emotion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20253\">CLIENT: Oh, so there you go, healthy is my constant hardly..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20255\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s important that you distinguish between healthy and unhealthy emotions. REBT does not aim to create apathy \u2013 it wants us to feel healthy emotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20257\">CLIENT: I understand that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20259\">THERAPIST: We want healthy emotions! Feeling concern motivates you to keep alert, to take action. Anxiety can paralyze or create panic attack symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2025B\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2025D\">THERAPIST: So, Ok carry on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2025F\">CLIENT: So, here\u2019s how I did it. The way I set it up was I would do, I wrote down all the, the ones, all the irrational beliefs, but then I did, I would take one and then do the dispute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20261\">THERAPIST: Perfect!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20263\">CLIENT: So what I\u2019m going to do ..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20265\">THERAPIST: I said \u201cPerfect\u201d! You didn\u2019t catch me!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20267\">CLIENT: I did catch it, I got that you were being funny \u2026 So what is the way I\u2019m going to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20269\">THERAPIST: Give me each irrational belief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2026B\">CLIENT: And then the dispute, just that way. So the first irrational belief is: If I make a mistake and screw up, I will feel regret for my whole life; very irrational.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2026D\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s irrational about that? Which part of it? Just specifically which part of that sentence irrational, because not all of it is irrational necessarily. Which part of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2026F\">CLIENT: Whole life<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20271\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20273\">THERAPIST: That kind of prediction has no basis. Can you predicting the future, and what will happen for the rest of your life !<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20275\">CLIENT: Whole, whole is irrational .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20277\">THERAPIST: And that kind of negative prediction that\u201d I\u2019ll regret it for all of my life\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20279\">CLIENT: Ok, so then the way that I disputed was: If I make a mistake life will go on. I am human, all humans make mistakes. I do not have all the answers and there is no such thing as the absolute. And there is no such absolute answer especially with something like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2027B\">THERAPIST: Very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2027D\">Ok, two: Others will think I am dumb, impulsive and not thorough if I get the surgery now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P17-N2027C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"16\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2027C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":18,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"18\" data-page=\"18\">\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2027F\">THERAPIST: Ok, that, as you\u2019ve written and stated it, is not necessarily irrational<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20281\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s more of a statement?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20283\">THERAPIST: Well, others may think that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20285\">CLIENT: Well, can I say how I disputed that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20287\">THERAPIST: First tell me what you think would make that irrational?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20289\">CLIENT: If I allow it to affect me<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2028B\">THERAPIST: By adding to what you wrote by thinking that \u201cit would be awful\u201d or \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand that\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2028D\">CLIENT: Oh! oh, oh ok! That, I didn\u2019t put that in there, but that was what, that was THE irrational. Ok \u2013 I just want to add that in (turning page \u2013 writing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2028F\">THERAPIST: Please add that in\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20291\">CLIENT: And I can look back at that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20293\">THERAPIST: Yes. Because even if others may think you\u2019re out of your mind, some people just won\u2019t care, those musings are not irrational, but when you add to them \u2013 \u201cand I couldn\u2019t stand it if \u2026and that they shouldn\u2019t \u2026.\u201d \u2013 then it becomes an irrational thought or thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20295\">CLIENT: You know what\u2019s really funny though? When I was writing it, I didn\u2019t think, I wrote that just now but when I was actually writing it I was thinking alright and then this is how I dispute it. Others can think what they want, that\u2019s their opinion. It\u2019s my body and I will decide what\u2019s right for <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N202951\">me and nobody else can do that. I really truly believed that when I wrote it. (laughing) I don\u2019t think I believed that before. Cause in the past I would think \u2013 \u201cmom, dad, what should I do? What should I do\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20297\">THERAPIST: You have the RIGHT to make choices, and experiment \u2013 try this and try that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20299\">CLIENT: Oh! Oh ok, ok, ok<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2029B\">THERAPIST: Because to have an expectation that you can know what\u2019s right for you already, will add pressure to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2029D\">CLIENT: I get it<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2029F\">THERAPIST: Remember, one of your goals is to be kinder to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202A1\">CLIENT: Number three was: If I get surgery it can make things worse. Now I know you\u2019re going to say that\u2019s not irrational, that\u2019s a possibility. For it to be irrational I would have to add\u201d and that would be awful\u201d. Did put that in on paper? No but that is really what I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202A3\">THERAPIST: Hang on, what were you going to say that I was going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202A5\">CLIENT: YOU were going to say that! (stumbles) That it could make things worse! But I didn\u2019t put it in that way<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202A7\">THERAPIST: It may or may not make things worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202A9\">CLIENT: May or may not, but I didn\u2019t put in \u201cand that would be awful\u201d, which is what makes it irrational, which is what creates anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202AB\">CLIENT: So, oh I got it. So three was I said if I am already in a lot of pain and if things get worse, that was the risk I took. Oh see, now no, no, no, hmm, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s, now I\u2019m looking at it differently but that\u2019s fine. I thought it based on what I felt was needed at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Thought, not felt, was needed at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202AF\">CLIENT: Oh, thought, ok. (writing) And then I added a little spiritual thing. I said God can help me here with knowing all the paths, knowing the course of things happening for a reason, and all will be ok. Because I think what I\u2019m having a hard time with is just feeling like this has been going on <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N202AF1\">for a long time and that I don\u2019t have an answer to which way to go and so that\u2019s where I put it on God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202B1\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t have an answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202B3\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t, so I said \u2013 God will you help me out here a little bit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202B5\">THERAPIST: Well you don\u2019t have an answer that is certain and brings guarantees.

Paper can be burned. And ideas can be changed and even concrete can be smashed.

I will document my pain level each day in a journal and try to look for patterns. If each day is good for a solid two weeks I will proceed accordingly thereafter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202D5\">THERAPIST: Which is a very good practical strategy, however, you neglected to address specifically the thought we identified: \u201dand that would be awful\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202D7\">CLIENT: Wait, in just that second part of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202D9\">THERAPIST: Yes, remember you added it just now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202DB\">CLIENT: I did add that, right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202DD\">THERAPIST: \u201cAnd that would be awful\u201d \u2013 That is the part you had better, if you want success in disputation, breakdown.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202DF\">CLIENT: Ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202E1\">THERAPIST: So, could you dispute \u201cand that would be awful\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202E3\">CLIENT: Oh, I see what you\u2019re saying, um<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202E5\">THERAPIST: In addition to what you said, I mean it\u2019s good to give yourself healthy, rational information, when disputing the nonsensical ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202E7\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t think I was able to do that before so I was excited about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202E9\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s very good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202EB\">CLIENT: Instead of catastrophizing, oh no wait a minute \u2013 here I go, I can say you have options, you can delay it, you don\u2019t have to decide, no one\u2019s coming in with like a gun telling you, you have to get surgery tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P19-N202ED\">THERAPIST: That is a healthy part of putting it in healthy perspective.

One recommendation that I do have, I would love a book that has just a list of like lots of example of irrational beliefs and then, you know when I\u2019ve tried to (stumbling badly) (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20307\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll complete it in 2015 !<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20309\">CLIENT: I will do all the irrational beliefs, and I would love that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2030B\">CLIENT: Ok next I\u2019m afraid to bother the surgeons with my neurotic inquiries; they\u2019re too busy for me. That was what it was. You know, asking questions as follow up even though I\u2019ve already had my appointments, is that wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2030D\">THERAPIST: Too make it easier, phrase your irrational belief clearly and concisely, and the more effective you can be at disputing it.

The surgeons do this for a living, they chose this profession and I deal with neurotic people all day. I will accept myself regardless of my neuroses, besides REBT has helped me to be less neurotic. I don\u2019t know that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203271\">was so much disputing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20329\">THERAPIST: Right, it\u2019s not exactly so \u2013 it is more rationalizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2032B\">CLIENT: I had a little bit of fun with it though,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2032D\">THERAPIST: Good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2032F\">CLIENT: Because I actually felt like wait a second Jessa, you are worried about calling these surgeons and asking these questions, but you get phone calls all day long form parents that are so neurotic and you don\u2019t judge them. I\u2019m thinking this is what I do, I\u2019m getting paid to do it and they are getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N2032F1\">A LOT more salary than I am.

It\u2019s not life or death basically and I hate that grey area. Because it should be more clear. And when it\u2019s not clear I can\u2019t stand it. So, hold on.

(thinking) If you had a ticker across my head right now it is so many \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d and so many \u201cmust\u2019s\u201d I\u2019m working on that! And then it has you saying, and can I say what I am saying in my head right now? Debbie would say, \u201cjust say it, it doesn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N2038F1\">to be the perfect answer!\u201d I know! I do! I have it in my head! I don\u2019t have something ready and I think this is interesting because it does have a lot to do with the words, it\u2019s all about the words and not, and I can\u2019t find them right now so just hold on!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20391\">THERAPIST: Ok, patiently, that\u2019s fine..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20393\">CLIENT: So it may be unfair and it may seem wrong<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20395\">THERAPIST: Maybe or maybe unfairness is a part of life? Can your students really not survive a situation that appears unfair? That would be the dispute. Make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20397\">CLIENT: Oh, ok, ok, could they survive something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20399\">THERAPIST: You may at times Jessa be looking for the genius insights that can enlighten the world, when you dispute instead of just keeping it simple! Start with that and then later in your spare time find the words to enlighten the planet.(Jokes) Start small!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2039B\">CLIENT: I love that one! Could they survive what\u2019s unfair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2039D\">THERAPIST: I mean what can they expect throughout their life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2039F\">CLIENT: Disappointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203A1\">THERAPIST: Yes \u2013 at times. It is unlikely that anyone will get everything that they want, when they want it? Children, who are spoiled in certain ways, can end up being adults who feel entitled, how does that help them in the bigger picture? Usually not and it can be hard for them to face facts and <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N203A11\">reality. I\u2019ve worked with some people who are suffering distress after not having everything they wanted when they wanted it. So, if your students \u2026 CLIENT: have something they don\u2019t want to deal with, such as their favorite counselor being absent for a few weeks, people might argue that\u2019s not even <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N203A12\">unfair, but if you\u2019re going to perceive it in that way, it can be healthy to dispute the shoulds. And, I think I am going to miss them too!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203A3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a whole other area to explore around the idea of \u201cI wish I could be with them\u201d\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203A5\">CLIENT: Oh I see, that one has nothing to do with the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203A7\">THERAPIST: No, no, get clear, thinking I wish is healthy , thinking I should\u2026 is a demand \u2013 not healthy to do that \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203A9\">CLIENT: Oh! ok, ok, ok, got ya!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203AB\">THERAPIST: So you did the disputing, did you get around to your effective new philosophy, as in E as in ABCDE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203AD\">CLIENT: Well, because of the time issue -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203AF\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t have my paper with me and to be honest with you, I forgot about that part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203B1\">THERAPIST: You did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203B3\">CLIENT: I really did, and I was like it\u2019s the ABC and I just forgot about the E.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203B5\">THERAPIST: The good news is, right now, you are smiling and I\u2019m not getting too much that you are beating yourself up! Even though you didn\u2019t complete your homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P22-N203B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"21\"><span data-id=\"P22-N203B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":23,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561800\" data-realpage=\"23\" data-page=\"23\">\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203B7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not! (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203B9\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s progress isn\u2019t it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203BB\">CLIENT: I just forgot!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203BD\">THERAPIST: Even though this is your 10th session of REBT!! (laughing) How are you not making yourself guilty?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203BF\">CLIENT: I just think it\u2019s so \u2013 cause I was laughing, cause I was like Jessa \u2013 telling myself how many times have you been doing it and you forgot? Ok, it just shows how much I wasn\u2019t doing it before for me. Now I am doing it for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203C1\">THERAPIST: And you also are using your sense of humor at this moment. So your homework for this week is to write down the effective new philosophies of what we went over now and the other homework that I gave you earlier. Write down self-soothing conversations that you will use if you feel symptoms <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N203C11\">of panic and extreme anxiety. I ask you to do with those two homework\u2019s, so that you can really give yourself the opportunity to really focus and do them thoroughly. I\u2019m already predicting in all probability next time I see you I might invite you to do a very full and thorough ABCDE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203C3\">THERAPIST: For now, two homework\u2019s, and we will start next week with those and you can tell me what you did and didn\u2019t do!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203C5\">THERAPIST: Any final comments or questions before we complete this session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203C7\">CLIENT: No, just a comment, I have noticed a change in myself and it\u2019s not I know that this stuff takes work, I am very aware of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203C9\">THERAPIST: What change and progress doesn\u2019t take work or effort by the way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203CB\">CLIENT: Nothing, anything worthwhile in the end comes without work, I guess. But what I am saying is it takes work, but the beautiful part of today, is that in this state of panic with something very big happening, I was able to stop, and think wait a second, you have options, you have choices\u2026 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N203CB1\">I was able to have conversations with myself. And it can be overwhelming in a good way. Anything that is new is a risk, I personally think this was a big risk that I took by doing it and I am very thankful that I did. That\u2019s what I have to say. It\u2019s a continuing part of my journey, to be able to apply <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N203CB2\">this stuff to every day life, not just to the big challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203CD\">THERAPIST: Keep on, Keep on Jessa. The more you make effort and are mindful, the more you can notice changes. Good job Jessa ! See you next session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P23-N203CF\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
