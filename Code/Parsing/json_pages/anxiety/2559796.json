I didn't want to get up this morning. I didn't want to get up yesterday morning either. Things (inaudible at 00:01:21) (PAUSE) We don't have air conditioning in our apartment which I think is affecting James more than it is me. So he went to the library for a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">few hours yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">You know, it was very funny.

I really don't. (PAUSE) The problem is the most difficult things of this nature, I say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">\"Well, this could happen or it could not happen.

You know, (inaudible at 00:05:37) think of, \"I'm afraid of technology,\" and think of someone with that would say, that's basically what it is. I'm not sure that he actually is afraid of technology but he really talks like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">he is. In case you can't tell, I'm not terribly sympathetic to him. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I can see what he means but, I mean... Like I stopped using Facebook for a couple of months and that's because I was doing really, really badly and... (PAUSE) I don't know. I'm not even sure where I'm going with this. I just thought of it. So there was this... Do you read (inaudible at 00:06:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: No. I think I've seen it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: You've probably seen it.

But I don't know if I want to be that confrontational. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. I thought I had a point but (inaudible at 00:07:57) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I keep thinking about what we talked about yesterday but I don't know what to say about it.

You know, I think it's... (PAUSE) I think it's good for me to have as much free time as I do. I think it helps and makes it less difficult for my... (PAUSE) That's not the only thing that makes me... (PAUSE) I didn't want to get out of bed yesterday morning and I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">nothing to do that day. (LAUGHTER) Like I had to... I had an appointment with you and that was it. A couple of errands that I would like to run but nothing I had to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I had just had that same like... (PAUSE) Basically, you know, I end up shaming myself into getting out of bed because it's so late. Yeah. It was like ten or 10:30 I got up. (PAUSE) Once it hits like eleven, I know I'm going to feel bad about myself even after I get up. So... (LAUGHTER) I might as well <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">just do it now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:12:55) time of the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You're struggling with to settle on something to talk about and I think mostly you're worried about sort of there being room for how you feel within you, particularly within me. You're talking about a bunch of things that illustrate how you're feelings. Like James is cranky. It must be the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">apartment. Or you're so anxious about thinking about moving, you can't actually have a place to think about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">You know, it's sort of like you avoid it or you freak out about it. You know, you (inaudible at 00:15:11) Or... Right. Or with your schedule, even with your free time. It sort of helps because it gives you a little more time to feel what you're feeling. But it's still sort of uneasy, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: It's still hard to... It gives me room to do things. I'm not sure that it gives me more time to feel what I'm feeling. You know, it's like morning and like late at night that I actually like tend to feel like I'm able to feel as bad as I do and the rest of the day, not so much, or I just don't. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(inaudible at 00:16:31) which is why I do those other things probably. (LAUGHTER) \"I feel awful.

(LAUGHTER) Like is there room in this sort of apartment for your cranky feelings and the two of us?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">Yeah, I sort of have a lot of trouble, you know, saying, \"Just because I'm functioning doesn't mean I have to be happy.\" (LAGUHTER) That's not exactly what I mean. But like... I guess I keep expecting you to say, \"Okay, you're better now. Go away.\" (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: That would be nice because it would be nice to be better.

I'm functioning well (PAUSE) But I feel like (inaudible at 00:20:53) And you'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">say, \"I don't know about that.\" (LAUGHTER) So I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559796\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">It mostly just feels self-indulgent to let myself feel that.

Then I don't really like that in myself or trust that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">A, that's weird and B, how could I stop? (PAUSE) You know, but I like (SIGH) seek out (inaudible at 00:23:51) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, that's maybe why (inaudible at 00:24:01) in touch with what you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I think that's why. I just don't trust that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I guess I have an idea of what's going on when it's (inaudible at 00:24:39) what you're talking about at the moment. We were talking about yesterday and maybe a little bit the next day. I think you also like idealize me a bit because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) You shock me. (LAUGHTER) Sorry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I'm not as scared or intolerant of your like bad feelings, upset, anger to some extent (inaudible at 00:25:35) to some extent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I mean, if I am super amazing and sort of rare in my ability to tolerate those things, you don't have to feel so bad about how hard it can be for you to have those feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Like if that... If it was a rare quality, it was okay that I didn't have it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Well, that's also... I think it's makes it okay that other people don't have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing. So that maybe one other point actually, particularly your parents, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">Yeah. I think that's actually (inaudible at 00:27:17)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's a more emotionally charged statement for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I think so.

I should (inaudible at 00:29:07) (PAUSE) Yeah. Yeah, I'm sort of uncomfortable with that because like idealizing people always gets me into trouble.

Maybe it was somebody who found you attractive and could not care less what you had to say or what you were talking about. But more conceivable is somebody who actually enjoyed the conversation but partly with the hopes of something more. Do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F31\">know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Like it doesn't necessarily mean like they had no interest in you as a human being at all.
