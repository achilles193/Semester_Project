Shit! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Pretty good outfit, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Look at that! One or two minutes, not bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Not bad at all!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Not bad. So, um, getting right to it (therapist affirms) I... spent the weekend organizing magic cards, shredding my collection down to almost nothing, and then selling it all on Sunday for $2000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Oh my God! Wow!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah! And you know what? I made $7000 total out of magic, the gathering collection, over the past few years. It\u2019s been a number of mortgage payments (therapist affirms) which has been good. About three. (chuckles) So, um... it\u2019s about to be another one, I think, not that (inaudible), but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So that was great! I felt great about doing that, and I was really focused and clear. I spent the entire thing, so I wouldn\u2019t have to do work, you know? Still made $2000, didn\u2019t do work at all. I have a test comprising six sections today. Usually, it\u2019s on three, but I\u2019ve had two weeks to do... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, because you had the break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: But I have not done (sighs) that, and so, you know, I\u2019m now a little rusty from the previous stuff I just did, you know? I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t want to look at normal, since these scores. Again, you should have gotten those. But, still...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: So, you go in today and you have to take both tests today? Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: It, I was going, it comprises one test (therapist affirms), so... It could be that seven one through three are really easy like, six one through three were, right? Just like, this is mostly just terms and basics, and so the only hard thing I\u2019ll have to learn would be six, four through six. (client <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">affirms) So... If that\u2019s the case, now it\u2019s not so bad. But today is our 15-year anniversary, so I want to get home at some point, you\u2019d think, and be like, \u201cHey, Happy Anniversary!\u201d We\u2019ll, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll do something stupid. We always do something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019ve got time to look over the stuff before, you can take the test whenever you want? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, as long as I take it today. (therapist affirms) (inaudible) And I get one re-take. So I mean, I can always take the strategic, learn as much as I can, go in, do the best I can, which might be enough, and take it again Thursday. (therapist affirms) So here is the tricky thing, Carl. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">Here we are, back on the plan now, okay? The plan was I\u2019ve not called in a psychiatrist, but I shall do so, because I should get right on that. (inaudible) I\u2019ll be out of weed tomorrow, possibly Wednesday morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">Now, this is good news, because... I\u2019ll have a brief window of... Sweet; let me sit down and focus on some work for Thursday. We\u2019ll meet Thursday morning, so I\u2019d be cool. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are going to be difficult, could be difficult, but I have to also study then for work on Monday. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">I need to go into this (sighs) as armed as possible, which means I need to be doing yoga every day. I guarantee you, I\u2019ll be sore. (sighs) Because I was so good when I was doing that. That was so useful, you know? I think I need to... I know I need to get back into that. So... (sighs) but again, just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">things, knowing the drop is coming and knowing (therapist affirms) and doing what\u2019s best. You\u2019ve seen me do this numerous times, Carl. This is not new to you, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563421\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s not.

(client affirms) You get through it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Two of our colleagues are coming down this weekend, is that, will that be cool? (therapist affirms) Later on? All right. I might give you a call, who knows. I\u2019ll try not to, because you\u2019re not (inaudible), so... I\u2019ll, now it\u2019s a little bigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, tell, yeah, what do you, yeah, what do you think the weekend will be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Well... (sighs) (pause) I\u2019ll probably go hang out with friends, and if I\u2019m really unlucky... I\u2019m really unlucky, I don\u2019t know, if I\u2019m even looking at statistics, it\u2019s slightly, it\u2019s a very good chance Charles brings weed wherever he goes. Then, if there is weed, (inaudible) will want to go. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">Great; well, now it\u2019s, I can take that quick jump back up, where Charles won\u2019t be in tomorrow, you know. So I have the avoid the situation... which, I mean, he\u2019ll respect if I\u2019m like, you know, I\u2019m going, if it\u2019s like, \u201cHey let\u2019s go to my house.\u201d I\u2019m like, (inaudible) weed, you know. It will be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">\u201cOh, okay.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(pause) If you\u2019re going to Eugene\u2019s, you know, might just be like, you go, fine. If you\u2019re bringing your weed, just don\u2019t, don\u2019t ever ask me. Don\u2019t ever ask me. (inaudible) ever look at me, don\u2019t give me the look of like, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d You know, because when we do that to each other, you know, when <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">we\u2019re separately being like, \u201cNo, now is a good time to stop.\u201d (pause) Because we want company. (pause) Yeah, so... Charles and I recognize it, too. We\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, this stuff... if we have it, we\u2019ll smoke it until it\u2019s gone (therapist affirms), you know?\u201d And it\u2019s like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: But it wasn\u2019t, it, this one wasn\u2019t really amotivational (ph), right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: No, it was, it was nice. It was really nice. And like... again, you know, it was... I mean, I had a manic night, which, you know, where I stayed up basically, I think, all night, just sorting the cards. But, and I didn\u2019t miss the sleep. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, that was clearly manic,\u201d you know, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">that\u2019s what I, you know, mark those. Because there was the day leading up to it, Monday, from the day where it happened, you know, so... And the day afterward was, I was still focused, but I, you know, I was like, \u201cNow I need to get to sleep at regular time, make the time to do this.\u201d So... It took <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">four hours, it took four hours to... sell the entire collection, because I had to bring it along and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Oh, and then show it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, he had to go through each and every single like... And I had sorted them, I was like... Like, these are all the things that are like... It was like, \u201cThese are both rare. These are worth ten cents a pop, too.\u201d So he has a box of them like, 1000 of those, you know. So... And... great, we\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">have to count those out, so you\u2019re sure, he makes it a stack of 100, then then measures everything else against that stack. And he\u2019s like, \u201cAll right, so we\u2019re looking at this much.\u201d And he gives me a great deal, because we\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve been selling him $7000 worth of magic cards for the past couple <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">of years, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">So, most places, they give you like 40% on something, you sell it to them. He\u2019s given me like, 70-90% in value, you know. On some of the cards he gave me straight out retail value. He was like, \u201cThese are going to move.\u201d He was like, \u201cSo I\u2019m just going to basically take these through the system.\u201d You <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">know, I\u2019m just like... taking (inaudible) to get someone else, who gave me the money, you know? So... that\u2019s really nice. I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s great! That\u2019s fantastic!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563421\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">Then, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, I need a few things,\u201d you know. So I\u2019m like, \u201cI need a couple more of these cards for the cube that I keep, you know, because my collection is now a box of, about 800 cards, and then three binders of less than a 1000 cards. The capacity is less than a 1000, so therefore that is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">the size of my collection, give or take. Each binder is from one of three criteria a card had to meet, in order to be kept: art, power, or history. So (inaudible) for each. It was nice, and so I got one for all this stuff (inaudible) cards and the ultimate art cards and the signed cards that have somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">(inaudible) throughout my collection, which is unfortunate, because you can\u2019t sell signed cards. Nobody wants a signed card, because there are so many magic artists, and there is no verification of,\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, signed by the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, by the artist, yeah. It\u2019s like, I think he just drew on my card, you know like, with the (inaudible). So, it actually greatly devalues the card. Still, since I have mine, I know them to be legit, because I know the people from whom they came. I\u2019m like, okay. (pause) To some degree. But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">the great news about signed cards is if you need to make room in your collection, you can start pitching them, you know? It was like, I threw so many cards in the recycling bin. I was like, \u201cOh, I just don\u2019t have like, room for these in a box.\u201d Chuck!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, just like, the basic stuff like, because like, he gives me, he\u2019s giving me a great deal. So, normally, they sell these boxes, mystery boxes, for $6, right? There are just like, a thousand cards, so it could be, you know, common or uncommon rarity, from any magic set. You have no idea what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">in there. It\u2019s not useless playing cards, but it\u2019s... a box of a thousand cards, could be anything. They sell for $6. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">They\u2019ll buy them from me for $3, but they\u2019ll need to sell me the box first, which is $1.50. So I make a $1.50 off a thousand cards. If you\u2019ll recall, last time I was in, I was like, \u201cListen I\u2019ll be bringing like, thousands and thousands of these cards, and I don\u2019t want to pay for the boxes. So he gave <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">me like $200 in boxes for free. (therapist responds) He was like, \u201cHere. There you go.\u201d \u201cThank you!\u201d So, I come in, he\u2019s like, \u201cWe actually raised the price of these to $8 a box, as an experiment. So I\u2019m going to pay you $4 a box for all of these.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be paying $4 a box very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">soon.\u201d He was like, \u201cBut since you\u2019re here, it\u2019s $4 a box.\u201d \u201cExcellent! Great!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">So, yeah, basically, I had 200 of those. No, that\u2019s right, I had 20 of those, I had 20 of those boxes, so that was nice. And, you know... (pause) Anyway, so, but it was just really, a really nice experience to go through cutting that whole thing down, and then just being like, \u201cAnd I need these things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">too,\u201d you know? And him being like, \u201cYeah, like, because I want that troll war (ph) right now, I want it so much.\u201d You know like (therapist affirms) you know, and I was like, \u201cAll right, can\u2019t, I can\u2019t spend a $100 on that.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to spend $100 on that.\u201d I was like, \u201cI need like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">800 sleeves of the same type and brand from the same shipment,\u201d so I could re-sleeve my cube, because those sleeves are getting old and tattered. That\u2019s $80, you know? I needed some other cards (inaudible). It was like, I wanted $250 worth of stuff, he gave me for $90, off of the total that I, the stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B3\">I was like... \u201cThis is great.\u201d (therapist affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563421\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">So, I mean... hell, I haven\u2019t put it in the bank yet, so I shouldn\u2019t even count it. A lot could happen between here and the bank, you know. But... (pause) Regardless, I did that instead of doing work, partially because today I\u2019m thinking, part of me is like, \u201cWell, your brain is going to kick in. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">go down and you go there, you sit down, you put some Mozart on, and go through problems...\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: But I think, you know, you were really getting into this more, I think, on Friday even more and more about, you know, I think this idea of... \u201cIt should be perfect already,\u201d so important to it all. \u201cI should know this already.\u201d (client affirms) I was thinking about that a lot, actually, after <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">we left. I think that was a really important thing, because it made me think about how... how sometimes, you know, how you have... that there are definitely that side of you that thinks, \u201cGod, if I don\u2019t know it without learning it first, there is something wrong.\u201d Then I thought, at the same time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F2\">what really makes you who you are is that you\u2019ve learned through experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Trial and error.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Like, you have done more with your brain than anybody, you know...

She... anyway, she was in this play.[] (therapist affirms) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">So we took the short story and adapted it.

You sit back, and you watch it go, you know, because it lives.

(therapist affirms) And it\u2019s done forever! You know? And you\u2019re like, \u201cYou know what I\u2019m not doing on Monday? Going to class, because I\u2019m going to be hung the fuck over,\u201d you know. Some teachers are going to hate that about me, because I\u2019m a theater <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D71\">student, and they know I\u2019m going to miss Monday after a play, because I\u2019ll be too way the fuck hung over to come to class, you know. But others are like... I teach at, what apparently, is a party college. It\u2019s something that halfway through, someone was like, \u201cDo you know that Harold is actually regarded <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D72\">as a party college? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">CLIENT: And I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d We have basically engineers and artists, you know? It\u2019s like, engineers work hard all day, and then go out and they fucking drink, because they just fucking crunch work like crazy. They\u2019re like, \u201cAll right, now let\u2019s go obliterate ourselves,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB1\">you know? You know, and all the artists are like, \u201cLet\u2019s just fucking open up our minds and expand our experiences.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563421\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: How did you find Harold?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: Serendipity. [], from the academy, a couple of years ahead of me, graduated and went there, actually really liked it. The college advisor at the academy was a kind woman, I forget what her name was. She was like, \u201cI think you would like it, because you want to do linguistics, or you want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">do theater.\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking do linguistics. Like, language is so fucking easy,\u201d you know? It\u2019s like, I scheduled Latin, Russian, Spanish, you know? It\u2019s like, it\u2019s... whatever. I\u2019ve learned all three of those like, I\u2019ll pick up anything. So I wanted to go to Princeton and learn <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF2\">just fucking every language I can learn, you know. That was part of the plan, for a while, you know. But then... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Princeton is Chicago?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s in New Jersey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: New Jersey? Oh, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that was part of the plan. But then, I was like, \u201cBut I\u2019m really learning towards theater, you know? Like, I\u2019m good at this.\u201d After The Misfit, it was like, \u201cHang on, I\u2019m actually good at this. Like, I can do this. What I\u2019m doing is real.\u201d I had to write up my Senior Project on what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E71\">(inaudible). It was like a ten-page paper, you know, my Senior Project. I had to put on a tiny little play as well, it was shit, but... One of them was great, the other was shit. One was Tom Stauffer\u2019s (sp), the one with the bell. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve scanned through his stuff (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">I guess, it\u2019s a very quick, short comedy, it\u2019s hard to fuck up. If you have two charismatic kids doing it, it\u2019s going to be great. So... (pause) Anyway, so I wrote this paper, you know, on what my process was. One of the teachers was like, \u201cDo you realize this is method acting?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E91\">He was like, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve written is method acting.\u201d He was like, \u201cThis is what method actors do.\u201d (therapist responds) And like, I felt, I mean, (inaudible) it\u2019s like I invented Calculus. I\u2019m like, (inaudible). I invented Calculus! Like, Newton invented Calculus like, a long time ago, but that\u2019s awesome. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E92\">(therapist affirms) And he invented Calculus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you got it instinctively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">CLIENT: (pause) I did it well, I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Without even larger, yeah...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: I mean, well, we learned, you learn to change who you are. I watched my mother lie like a crow, you know, and adapt who she will be in any situation. And you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well that\u2019s easy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Method acting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Mask everything that\u2019s going on. I notice that most of my emotions are asymmetrical. Like, on this side of my face doesn\u2019t emote nearly as much as this side of my face does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: And... that\u2019s because this side really shows emotion more clearly and more instinctively. It\u2019s harder to control the mark on this side, whereas this side...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I never realized it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. It seems that way, when I look at pictures of myself, or like... My smile is always been a half smile. (therapist affirms) You know? I don\u2019t know. Anyway, who knows? But, yeah. I mean, the combination of those things, just learning those things and... yeah, and doing them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD1\">But again, that intimacy. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200FC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563421\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">(pause) Yeah, the most beautiful thing, it\u2019s a beautiful thing that two people do. And you have to do it a lot of times, and sometimes it was shit, sometimes the show was just shit, and you did the best you could with what you had. Other times, the show was really good, and you were really good, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: You know, it does make me kind of like, it just made me think about sort of it all, my mind went to engineers and how they, you know, where I went to undergrad, they grouped together and did those things as a group, too, a very intimate kind of, very different than theater, (chuckles) but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: But they do, oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: They, do. They bunch it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">CLIENT: They get like, a suite together, you know like, they build crazy bullshit traps in our apartments, and then they like, munch on work all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">CLIENT: There was a while where you had to watch it. You had to go in through the window of Eugene\u2019s place, when he and Alex and Robert were there together, it was six, six engineers roomed together. You had to go through the window and avoid the bucket of water that they had laid as a trap, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B1\">if you go in through the door, the swinging dildo would fly down and hit you in the face, so you really swung in through the window. (therapist chuckles) And then see which level of couch city they had. They had just stolen furniture from the various dorm rooms and other things they had found, just <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B2\">carried them right out of their apartment, stacked couches and chairs. Anyways, but this all came from the talk about project management, which was that it\u2019s this constantly failing mess until it\u2019s perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Huh! Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">CLIENT: You know? And it\u2019s like, you\u2019re going to keep fiddling with it, and it\u2019s going to keep breaking, yeah. That\u2019s the thing I tell QA kids in the end. You know, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh! There is all this!\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, dude!\u201d Like, you know, we\u2019re telling (inaudible). It was like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F1\">to go into crunch, I\u2019m going to crunch for some time.\u201d That\u2019s going to be beyond our control, that\u2019s what we do. The good news is you can make a lot of money, not having time to spend it. (therapist chuckles) So you can save some cash for after this project, so that\u2019s good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">(pause) I said a couple of things. I said, one, assuming (inaudible), I was like, \u201cOne, consider the fact that you are part of making something beautiful, and what that is, you know, whatever that means to you. But by being here and doing this, that\u2019s your part of doing something beautiful, making something <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201111\">beautiful.\u201d I said, \u201cThe second thing is, it\u2019s going to get much worse before it gets any better. It\u2019s like, this game is going to break harder than you\u2019ve seen it break, ever. That\u2019s, it\u2019s going to... There have been many times when you think you cannot possibly make this, but we will make it, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201112\">this is how the process works.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah! I think that\u2019s the... analogy for Work, for running stats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">CLIENT: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: It really is!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">CLIENT: Huh. I\u2019ve been doing it every day. (both chuckle) That\u2019s what you do when you go to work. You go to work and you just do it every day.

So, I was telling the story of when I first was a player, I never told you this part. You know, looking back in retrospect, you know, you\u2019re like, \u201cHa, ha!\u201d I come to play, we\u2019re like, we\u2019re going to (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201251\">this game like, you know, in like a few weeks, into open beta, go into open beta in a couple of weeks. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to use the QA guy. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019m already just (inaudible) (therapist chuckles) you know. You should have had me a while ago.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20127\">But I\u2019m there and like, \u201cOkay, yup. I\u2019m testing, I see what you have, there is very little here, you have a couple of useless guys (inaudible) or whatever. But I\u2019m going to hire someone here, it\u2019s going to be great.\u201d (pause) I\u2019m there... I\u2019ve been there a few days, less than a week, and we\u2019re talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201271\">about, you know, how are we going to hit our goal of getting open beta in a couple of weeks. This is in... early May, ealry May this starts. (pause) Oh, no, in June, in June, it\u2019s like, are we going to hit it in June? Like, are we on track to get this thing in June, you know, at the end of June? Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201272\">is like, four weeks away at that point; no, six weeks. So... and... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20129\">I\u2019m like, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. I need to have time to assess.

(pause) \u201cHow often do you slip your dates on your previous projects?\u201d And you know, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh... usually a bit.\u201d \u201cBy how much? How much are your estimates off, historically? When you slip games (ph), how much do you, how many weeks do you slip them by?\u201d \u201cOh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B1\">it all depends (inaudible) game.\u201d Fine, but... you know, on a small scope game, same on your smaller scope, eventually, we will get there.

Then what I should have said like, \u201cDo you mean Brent, are we talking about Brent? I mean, he\u2019s pointing to you, so I think he means, do you agree with that assessment?\u201d That\u2019s what I should have said from that point, but I didn\u2019t. Instead, I just moved on with some other <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D2\">questions, which, I said, \u201cAll right.

I recall, I was (inaudible) player. He\u2019s on the phone with the guy who like, wants to keep his plant open, his office open, which, you know, is paying for like some QA guys like $10 a day per guy, you know. I was like, one, I\u2019m like, that\u2019s unethical, right? I\u2019m like, that\u2019s... <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2014B1\">I\u2019m not down to that!

I am not down with outsourcing jobs to other countries for shit money, right? We need jobs in this country, one; two, we\u2019re giving them shit money, right? It\u2019s good money for where they are, but... considering what we could do for them? It\u2019s nothing. So... so basically, we\u2019re just exploiting <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2014F1\">them. It\u2019s like... and the idea is, we\u2019ll hire a ton of them, you know? Because they\u2019re so cheap. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20151\">THERAPIST: I remember, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">CLIENT: But the great part about that is, \u201cWe\u2019re going like, no, we\u2019re shutting it down. Like, we don\u2019t need it, and we should shut it down.\u201d Oliver doesn\u2019t want to, because it\u2019s kind of his baby from his previous company. He was on the phone with Josh, and Josh looks at me, he\u2019s like, \u201cIf I close down, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201531\">how many more testers would you need here?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like, two.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me, you hire two testers here, that\u2019s better than 30 testers.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d (therapist chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20155\">Oliver said some more stuff, and he was like, \u201cSo you\u2019re positive?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI can put your name on this?\u201d \u201cYeah, put my name on it. You can tell him I\u2019m also basing that on my six years\u2019 experience.\u201d He was like, \u201cYou want me to add that part?\u201d \u201cYes, add that part. Absolutely!\u201d Like, (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201551\">I know what I\u2019m fucking talking about!

I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s $13 an hour.\u201d I gave her a chance to push back, but I wasn\u2019t being like, \u201cYou should push back,\u201d but <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201611\">I gave her a shot.

I should tell her that. I should actually, you know, that \u201cBy the way, you could have done $15. So, keep that in mind for later. I would totally have given $15.\u201d Later I got her, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201631\">later I got her $17, so it was like... This is fucking ridiculous, you know. I was like, I told Josh, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to give her a raise to this... Like, I know it\u2019s (inaudible) percent raise, it doesn\u2019t fucking matter, because like, this is what we should be paying her.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20165\">I said, \u201cBecause she\u2019s going to be elite.

(therapist repeats) You know, \u201cThis is which tool to apply to this problem.\u201d If you apply the tool, and use a calculator to get the numbers, especially one of those ones where you can watch the calculations you\u2019ve been doing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, do you think a certain kind of faith in yourself breaks down at some point, when you\u2019re...?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N201C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563421\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201CB\">CLIENT: There is a point... Well, yeah, I suppose. It\u2019s the point where I\u2019m like, \u201cAh! I cannot progress beyond this point!\u201d (therapist affirms) Right? It is not useful to put in energy now, to fret about this. I\u2019m not going to freak out the next few hours and like, get home at like 8:00 tonight, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201CB1\">9:00, and be like, \u201cHappy Anniversary! I just spent all day doing work, I\u2019m fucking exhausted and you have to go to sleep in an hour or so. I don\u2019t know. Do you want to watch Brooklyn 99 or something? Maybe an episode of House of Cards? You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201CD\">(pause) We\u2019ll do something stupid, you know. So, no. I\u2019m going to go, I\u2019m going to look at the work, I\u2019m going to assess, I\u2019m going to play with it, and then I\u2019m going to optimize. And that optimization may very well be go in, take the test, fail it, and then ace it on Thursday, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Give yours , yeah, then give yourself some (inaudible\/blocked)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201D1\">CLIENT: And then just do something else on Monday, you know, even though the weekend is going to be hard. Even though Sunday was so hard, the day before the test, when I was off the weed... I still... did really well on that test. I got 84 the next day. I went in, I looked over the work again, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201D11\">got an 84. I was like, \u201cThis was...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201D3\">THERAPIST: I know that you can do... There is no doubt. You just have to give yourself the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201D5\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s what it is. I just need to put the time in. It\u2019s so much, I have so much time, and I do so little with it, you know? I feel like I do various things, but some of the time is like, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d \u201cI spend a lot of it playing video games.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause I love being in other worlds <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201D51\">(therapist affirms), I like that, you know?\u201d So, I got to play Minecraft with like, with my nephew Dan (sp) for like, an hour. He\u2019s got like a house, he\u2019s building your mind and like (therapist chuckles), gets real excited. He found a little cave, he walled off both entrances to it and, you know, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201D52\">put a door in both ends. So, got a couple of beds in there, so we can make it dawn if we need to at any point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. If you\u2019re on a server, everyone is asleep at the same time, for the sun to come up; otherwise, he has to wait for ten minutes, the cycles, but... And it was great, it was wonderful, you know? He wants to get his friend on there. I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll get your friend on.\u201d He\u2019s a good kid, <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201D91\">I\u2019d vouch for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201DB\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s like, another world, where the world of these, of like, the anxieties about... like, learning that stuff comes over you. It is really hard. (client affirms) You lose, but that\u2019s the thing about you, though, I was thinking about it, is that\u2019s actually your greatest <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201DB1\">strength. You learn!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201DD\">CLIENT: I do learn. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201DF\">THERAPIST: You learn from experience. You hit walls and you get through them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201E1\">CLIENT: You\u2019re right, though. That is what I do best. (therapist affirms) That is what I do best, is I learn. I learn by trial and error, and that\u2019s the thing. You know, it\u2019s, that makes some people uncomfortable. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhy are there mistakes?\u201d \u201cBecause there are mistakes.\u201d (therapist affirms) <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201E11\">Because there are! Because there are, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, because you\u2019re making mistakes, and I\u2019m making mistakes, we\u2019re all doing it.

I\u2019ll get a failing grade, get a fucking passing grade at the end <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N201F91\">of the week. And remember, all I need to do is get a 70 on everything.
