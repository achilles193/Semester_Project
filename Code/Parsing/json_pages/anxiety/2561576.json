Like, I mean it\u2019s already the holidays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Sure. I actually was going to ask you, because I haven\u2019t deposited, maybe, about, I think, four checks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: So I went to do it yesterday, and I realized I probably should ask you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s so thank you so much. I appreciate it. Is there if I mean if there\u2019s any way you could like split them up somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Sure, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, like deposit like two sometime next week and then another two the week after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Next week after what time, do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh, after anytime after Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: But thank you for thinking of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: So a week makes a big difference, some really nice changes. So that was a bit of a rock bottom last week I think. But some good things came out of it. [00:01:01.22] My mom I gotta give my mom a lot of credit on this one. I think she sees she gets it, that I think she gets what I\u2019m trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">to do in terms of making like a bigger change for myself or whatever. So she called me down, obviously I was just like hibernating, like I wasn\u2019t going down there because I was just not in the mood or whatever. Called me down, said, I have an idea. So I go down there and she sits me down. She goes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">she\u2019s like, I was thinking, why don\u2019t we just condo the second and third floor as one condo. She\u2019s like then we could get a lot for that. And then we\u2019d pay off the mortgage, I\u2019d just move downstairs so I don\u2019t really because she doesn\u2019t want to move right from there. She\u2019s like it\u2019s really the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">thing. I\u2019ll just move downstairs and that way it\u2019s even easier for me to get in and out with groceries and this and that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Sorry, just so I follow, condo the second...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re a three family; it\u2019s a three family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Condo them to separate units.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Because it\u2019s a three family, with one of those like attic apartments. [00:02:01.23] My unit is like a nice one bedroom. So there are people in Cheshire or other places who are turning those into like nice big condos, bedrooms upstairs for the kids or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: So make it all one unit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: All one unit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Okay. And you\u2019d move down...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well for a while I\u2019d have to live with her on the first floor until but her thing was like can we pay off the mortgage. Then there\u2019d be money left over, then you could go buy a condo or whatever, and I wouldn\u2019t have a mortgage. You\u2019d be able to do buy something else. We\u2019d still have one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">unit equity and blah, blah, blah. That was very nice, and I thought about it, but then like two days later I was like wait a minute, why would we I went back downstairs; I was like what? I was like if you\u2019re okay with that then let\u2019s just sell the third floor unit. I was like let\u2019s just sell that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">for like it would basically just pay off the mortgage, right. I was like we wouldn\u2019t have a mortgage, and we\u2019d have two units. We\u2019d have we\u2019d have a two family. [00:03:02.16] And you could still live here, live downstairs, do whatever you want. I mean I\u2019d have to kind of stay with her for a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B3\">bit to figure out what\u2019s what, but then you\u2019d have two family equity. It\u2019s all now equity, no mortgage. So now that other rental now is just income. That\u2019s like 22 grand a year. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. So that\u2019s and I can tell with her if she\u2019s not she\u2019s on board, like I can tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: She means it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, she means it. Yeah. And she liked my idea even better because she doesn\u2019t want to lose the house, like she doesn\u2019t want to so at least having two units is most of the house. So I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m going to try to start fixing I\u2019m going to do my research, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">and then it needs to be fixed up a little bit. And I don\u2019t want them to lowball us because they have work to do on it or whatever. [00:04:01.20] But yeah, and in a way it\u2019s very simple. That doesn\u2019t mean we have tons of cash on hand, but in a way we do. Then all that equity is simply equity. It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">you know what I mean? Banks will give you money a lot easier, and you have income. That rental income isn\u2019t going to your mortgage; it\u2019s going into your bank. Plus, one way or the other I\u2019m going to be doing something work wise by summer or whatever. So I just gotta be more patient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">But that was, I think, the big lesson, anyway, with this whole thing. I think it was like rock bottom of just losing my job and being frustrated with a lot of things. So I think it was kind of like the the other upswing was talking to my friend Olive and my friend Lily. [00:05:01.00] I while this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">was happening with actually it was maybe before with my mom, before we made this decision. I don\u2019t know. But it was right around that day or whatever. It was like 10 o\u2019clock at night. I was just at home. You know how I am. Like I\u2019ll I feel like I gotta get out of the house for a little bit. If I came <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">home like late in the afternoon, it\u2019s getting dark early, and I\u2019m just so I\u2019ll just go for a drive or something like that. So I went to the market to pick up some things, and I was talking to my friend Olive. It was just a really good conversation. And she was like dude, like she helped me realize <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200413\">things just like here, right, like then I get it. Like then it finally absorbs. I was like yeah, I was like I am really hard on my I gotta like now I\u2019m really starting to get it, how hard I am on myself kind of. Because we were talking, she was like dude, I mean she said, you haven\u2019t really been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200414\">unemployed that long. She\u2019s like times are tough. [00:06:01.23] It was June, the end of May, so she\u2019s like okay, yeah, it\u2019s shitty, but you have your unemployment, and you can\u2019t just take any job because then you won\u2019t have your unemployment. So if you yeah, if I temp or if I work at a coffee shop <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200415\">or and I\u2019m not I don\u2019t want to do those things anyway, but that\u2019s the other problem, is that if I took some even an editing job, if I I have to report. If you get found out then you\u2019re really fucked. So if you report that well this week I made $250, they have all these fucking things about well <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200416\">then we can\u2019t give you unemployment this week. You have to reapply. So she was like dude, just, you\u2019ve never even had unemployment before. Just fucking take it. You\u2019re somehow getting by, right? You\u2019re getting by. So that was that. And then the other thing she helped me with, which I\u2019ve also been thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200417\">about, is that she\u2019s like dude and like don\u2019t give up on your business exactly or don\u2019t like she\u2019s like just don\u2019t give up on anything you\u2019re doing, but don\u2019t just don\u2019t let yourself you just you can\u2019t be that hard on yourself about all these things. [00:07:05.02] She\u2019s like most people try <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200418\">to do one thing and they can\u2019t get it done. She\u2019s like you\u2019re doing a million things and you\u2019re kind of getting them done. Kind of yeah, it\u2019s not perfect and it may take longer or this or that, or it\u2019s not exactly the way you want it, but she\u2019s like it\u2019s still a lot more than pretty much anyone that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200419\">I know does. So I don\u2019t what it was. It was all these conversations or whatever, but I ended up now I\u2019m ready. I started I just sat down and I\u2019m like writing kind of like a memoir thing. And it\u2019s like coming out, like and it\u2019s coming out kind of like effortlessly, which is weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. I even like had a good op I didn\u2019t even it was weird. I even had an opening, just like it was weird. It\u2019s like it\u2019s what I always say, like it\u2019s percolating. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: When it opens, it opens. [00:08:01.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019ve been working on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yup. Yup. So it\u2019s basically going to be about this idea that I always talk about, of like how when I look back on my past I kind of don\u2019t see myself, I don\u2019t recognize that person, and how strange that is. And like I always describe it as just beige or like this fog or whatever. So it\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">of about it starts with the moment I realized that that was the case. Like when I was like 30 or whatever. I was at a New Year\u2019s Eve party and someone asked me, oh, you they\u2019re like I didn\u2019t even know you lived in San Francisco. The fact that people don\u2019t even know, like not that I should be telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">people everything, but they just don\u2019t know certain things about my life. And then when this guy asked me, he was like what was it like or what I it was that was one of those moments where I literally didn\u2019t know what it was like. Like I had flashes of memories of me in San Francisco, but I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D3\">connect to those. That is weird, right? [00:09:04.03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Okay. What is that that\u2019s because of PTSD or some form of PTSD? Or some kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Something along those lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Because that\u2019s not usual, right, because you should be able to look back even when you\u2019re 15 and that\u2019s you. Like you feel a right? Okay, so that is weird. Okay. But anyway, so then I start writing about like that, like what is that and so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to become of it, but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">coming out. So so that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Really exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s good. I mean we\u2019ll see what I don\u2019t want to get over excited about it, but the fact that it\u2019s already coming out pretty I\u2019m not overthinking it, I\u2019m just writing it. I\u2019m just writing my story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: But even the idea there\u2019s a coherence to what you\u2019re describing you want to write about [inaudible] and never told me about about this the idea of [inaudible] particular aspect [inaudible]. [00:10:00.21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, because I feel like that ties into everything, right. It ties in with me being bicultural. It ties in with the PTSD. It ties in with anxiety disorder, questions about like identity and who you really are versus who people think you should be. And it\u2019s like a cluster fuck of epic <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">proportions. So I feel like that idea ties into all those things that sometimes you I mean I have a tentative title that\u2019s just I can\u2019t tell where I\u2019ve been. Because that pretty much sums it up to me. Like I can\u2019t I can\u2019t articulate or even understand the things I\u2019ve gone through. Like I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">locate myself. So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: A self that is so divided and parts [inaudible] from each other. [00:11:03.07] But it because it\u2019s about identity, culturally also [inaudible] solidify [inaudible] broken up into pieces. There\u2019s a story about [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Which that\u2019s why even the narrative, it\u2019s going to be that way. It can\u2019t be some kind of it\u2019s going to be a broken, fragmented narrative because I can\u2019t write it any other way. I just can\u2019t. There\u2019s just too much in my head, you know what I mean? I have bizarre memories that just don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">you know what I mean? You can\u2019t be a kid who already has these fucked up whatever issues you have unlike the Little League soccer team in North Carolina, but then have your mom telling you stories about how their fucking house in Assyria was just a dirt floor and there were wolves that would scratch <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200612\">at the door sometimes at night and she remembers giving like rotten bread to POWs. [00:12:13.13] That\u2019s just you know what I mean? You can\u2019t just write some kind of that doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense. So but it\u2019s I think it\u2019s gotta be told. I think now it\u2019s just coming out. But part of it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200613\">too, is that just I think it may be coming once I stopped it\u2019s not like I feel great, but once I took a step back and stopped just fucking whipping myself, it\u2019s coming out more. So yeah, no, my friend Olive and me, we\u2019ve both always been good. I mean it goes both ways. I think we just somehow connect <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200614\">on these deeper issues of I don\u2019t know what, like just we\u2019re all very different but just struggling to be ourselves or whatever, or balancing. They\u2019re more plugged into the just workaday world. [00:13:21.05] But they hate it, they know that it\u2019s all bullshit, like there\u2019s somewhere we really connect <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200615\">on a lot of these things. But yeah, it just made me feel good. And also she they\u2019re both so like Olive was like dude, you do you understand how talented you are. She was like do you understand all of the things that you\u2019re capable of doing, and doing well. She\u2019s like you\u2019re not half assed. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200616\">not it\u2019s not a hobby. Like she really like they\u2019re really just I appreciate that. It\u2019s like you just need to hear that from people sometimes in a genuine they mean it. They\u2019re not trying to just make you feel better. [00:14:00.29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">[pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: I wonder if [inaudible] our conversation on Thursday as you were talking about these conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Well the only thing that stayed with me was I was exhausted. I was like wow, I\u2019m like this is rock bottom, which is why I went to the symphony the next day. I went yesterday, too, actually. Yeah, I was just like, you know what, I gotta and I\u2019ve been feeling like shitty. I thought I had a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">cold, but now I think it\u2019s allergies. I don\u2019t know what but like I just I kind ofI haven\u2019t been feeling so great, like a weird dry throat or something, like a dry cough. So I was like, you know what, I yeah it was a rock bottom definitely kind of thing. And it still is kind of. [00:15:04.08] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">I mean I feel really super tense and but I also feel just relieved. Sometimes you gotta just hit the floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: I have a feeling that being as much as you call it rock bottom, in a kind of clich\u00e9d way there\u2019s something that felt like hitting on another layer of something that was waking up, and I guess you can call it rock bottom but more in the kind of something about the loan not working out felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">like coming to terms with a reality of some part of where you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Well the reality and also like the I think I just realized that I was feeling that I just feel frustrated and kind of not desperate but just really frustrated. [00:16:07.13] So I was really just trying to so it\u2019s hard. You get your hopes up. You try not to but you do. So that but that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">was a good lesson, kind of, then all right, listen, I gotta take a step back here, and there are other ways to get this done. I just gotta be patient. I can\u2019t and also realizing that it\u2019s still even this situation is better than a lot of people. That\u2019s what\u2019s crazy. Times are fucking hard. I\u2019m complaining <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B2\">because I have a three-family house. Not complaining but you know what I mean? Like I have a roof over my head that I own, that me and my mother own, this beautiful home. So whatever happens it\u2019s going to somehow work out one way or the other. It\u2019s just going to take longer, a little bit. I mean it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B3\">really not a big deal. So that and then the work thing, yeah, I just I was like dude, I just gotta calm down. [00:17:04.14] You feel guilt. Especially my kind of that\u2019s how it is, right? I mean I have a history of what am I doing, am I being lazy, and what\u2019s this stupid fucking poetry shit. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B4\">you just you can\u2019t focus, you start having all these arguments with yourself. Just like calm the fuck down. People get unemployed all the time. I\u2019ve never even had this situation before. That\u2019s saying something. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so there\u2019s some way when you get up against some of this stuff, it does sound like I don\u2019t know how to describe this. It\u2019s like it becomes inside even more proof of something more extreme than it actually is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Like somehow the feeling could be you\u2019re the only person that\u2019s ever been on unemployment, or what\u2019s wrong with me, or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Badness that that is just as much not in reality as pretending it\u2019s not happening, or finding a bubble, [inaudible] the whole things going to disappear. [00:18:11.10] Of course you\u2019re not alone. Like well how many people are on unemployment for longer or take a lot years and years to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">find a job, right. That but that\u2019s its own form of bubble, except it\u2019s one where you\u2019re everything\u2019s bad about you. Which isn\u2019t true either. Like there\u2019s something sounding like coming more into more of the reality. That\u2019s also not true. Just as there may not be some magical cure for this place. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200752\">It is there\u2019s something really hard about where you are, and it\u2019s going to take work and patience and a lot of research and investigation, just as writing a book would take, but that you sound like something opened up about being able to be more peacefully and a little bit closer to reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that is what it is, yeah. And also it\u2019s about letting go. [00:19:06.04] I was thinking about this like music. Like I\u2019m getting better, I think, slowly, finally, about like this is just it, kind of. You know what I mean? I am going to make records. I am going to and hopefully <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">really good things will happen with all that stuff, but I\u2019m getting better at just kind of not projecting, either, how I want it to go or why didn\u2019t it go a certain way already, or I\u2019m getting a little bit better. You know what I mean? And the way I\u2019m doing that is just it\u2019s just what Olive what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200772\">people are saying. I mean [inaudible] all these years, is just when you really just embrace that I am like I\u2019m okay knowing that I\u2019m talented. I don\u2019t need that\u2019s hard, when all your life you\u2019ve been kind of you feel like you\u2019ve been kind of slighted or hidden away or ignored. [00:20:03.28] <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200773\">You want fucking validation. That\u2019s all. I never I don\u2019t want to be a rock star, I just want I just want a little miniscule percentage of that. You know what I mean? And but it\u2019s two things. It\u2019s one, realizing if that never happens that I can be a little more of a realist and just that doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200774\">change the fact that I\u2019m a serious artist. Millions of very serious artists get no recognition in their lifetime. That\u2019s just the way it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: And are really talented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, are real artists, right, yeah. But two, that also some of it is when I can think that way then I actually start producing more. That\u2019s when things then in a weird way then you do get what you wanted in the first place because now you don\u2019t give a shit as much so you just do it. You record, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">you put shit out, you don\u2019t obsess over details or getting it just right or this or that. [00:21:05.25] You just do it. And then you realize oh, that\u2019s how these other assholes are doing it, who aren\u2019t a lot of whom aren\u2019t really talented. They\u2019re just putting shit out there constantly. So they have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B2\">to be reckoned with. It\u2019s just there. So it\u2019s yeah, I think that\u2019s all helping to kind of (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">It\u2019s funny, too, because it even helps me kind of prepare for tomorrow. Like now I really don\u2019t care. [00:22:02.11] Like I just I don\u2019t care what my aunt says or my uncle, like you know what I mean? I\u2019m not even going to get into when they\u2019re like how are you. Great. You know what I mean? There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">no point to I because I still want them to I love them. I\u2019m close with my I part of me you know what I mean? It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t like these people. I love them. So part of me still wants them to take a little more of an interest and get me, understand. But that\u2019s not working. So the best <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">thing to do is just say that you\u2019re fine, and just be with them and let them talk about their ridiculous things, but that\u2019s it. I\u2019m just not that\u2019s a good feeling. I mean hopefully that\u2019s the way it\u2019ll go, but in the past that\u2019s why I\u2019d get worked up at these family things because part of me still <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D3\">wants someone to just stop and like take an interest, a real interest in me, instead of just like asking me once how I\u2019m doing and then just [00:23:14.06] But that\u2019s it\u2019s a it doesn\u2019t excuse that stuff. But at the same time there\u2019s no point in getting extreme about it. Like they\u2019re not trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D4\">to be dicks or something. Of course they love me, you know what I mean? Like if I said any of this they\u2019d be like appalled and saddened and like freaked out that I feel this way. But so it\u2019s just better to just be with people that you care about and just not take it so seriously and not read into <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D5\">who cares. [pause] So I mean really what it is, all these things are actually making me they\u2019re actually renewing my focus on my art, right? It\u2019s all this peripheral stuff that just doesn\u2019t fucking matter anymore. [00:24:09.13] Kind of like the girlfriend thing or I mean that\u2019s all nice. I hope <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D6\">that all works out but I there\u2019s more important things I\u2019m trying to get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s a fundamental l thing, in a way, before any of that other stuff can really matter in a way is what you\u2019re feeling about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: Exactly. Which by the way, of course these things are always this way, right? They\u2019re ironic. But of course now, Okay Stupid, it\u2019s an avalanche of fucking dating suddenly. I don\u2019t even nothing\u2019s changed. But whereas before I\u2019d get a fair amount of attention, now it\u2019s like I\u2019ve got this whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">new roster of chicks I\u2019m supposed to be seeing or whatever. So it\u2019s ironic how as if it\u2019s a cosmic thing, like people just sense that you\u2019re in a different head space or something. [00:25:14.13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">[pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: Is it hard to hear you say how you feel about yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: No. Is it hard for me to hear you say how I feel about myself? No. No, because you\u2019re right. You\u2019re saying things that I you\u2019re articulating things that, yeah, I mean make perfect sense. [00:26:17.16] Is that what you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean [inaudible] things [inaudible] but there\u2019s something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well no, not always that I so much know, it\u2019s that I feel but didn\u2019t know are exactly that. That\u2019s another thing that I wrote for the second paragraph. I was like what happened that night was something that was like pestering me for years already, all through my twenties; suddenly in my thirties <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">became something I couldn\u2019t I told this guy Stoops [ph] that was the first time. I told him, I have no fucking idea. I\u2019ll never forget that. I still know him, he\u2019s a wacky guy. He was telling me about his panic attacks and shit. So maybe I just felt comfortable with him [inaudible] whoa, this guy\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B2\">really like this interesting, sensitive wack job or something. [00:27:04.04] But when he asked me about San Francisco and what\u2019s it like, blah, blah, blah, I was like I have no idea. I have no fucking idea what it was like or what happened or but so you know what I mean? So it\u2019s kind of like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B3\">Like something I was feeling but I couldn\u2019t right? Even that metaphor that I always use, it\u2019s just a beige. That\u2019s relatively new. That took me years to or the coma metaphor, the so sometimes you just need to either hear someone else say it or you finally somehow articulate something. But yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B4\">it\u2019s just like I\u2019ve got this feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I [inaudible] was just wondering [inaudible] follow this, but something about your immediately [ph] I said this, what matters is how you feel about yourself. You immediately then said that\u2019s true, but it felt like your mind was already running to something else, and you then said because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">lately guess what\u2019s happening [inaudible] stupid is an avalanche. [00:28:07.26] It like I wonder if you had to remind yourself or even remind me about being desirable. Like there\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">CLIENT: On some level, maybe.

Okay, there\u2019s this proof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">CLIENT: Well yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">THERAPIST: Proof right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">CLIENT: Well of course that\u2019s part of it, yeah, of course. Because it\u2019s like oh, I still have my mojo, still got...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yes, and in other words that\u2019s a little microscopic moment of still turning to that for proof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">CLIENT: Needing outside proof, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Instead of just knowing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. The only thing I\u2019d say is that\u2019s absolutely true. The only thing I\u2019d say is that\u2019s the irony, though, this time, I think. This time I think it is this attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re feeling it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m feeling it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I totally get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re in a different place. [00:29:02.25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">CLIENT: Honestly? Honestly, man? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever really going to go away. Maybe that\u2019s why I feel better. I\u2019m feeling you know what I mean? It just like I know that I\u2019m never not going to have I\u2019m never not going to have to manage anxiety and melancholy, you know what I mean. You don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF1\">cure that shit. You manage it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Until you move to the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: Right. That\u2019s slick. But I think even on the couch. I don\u2019t know. I think that some things are maybe they\u2019re semantics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Actually I don\u2019t agree. I think it could go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">CLIENT: All right. Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Just we can think different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">CLIENT: I think for maybe it could. I knowing enough about art and artists, maybe a lot of artists just don\u2019t work on themselves. I don\u2019t know. I feel like it\u2019s that\u2019s kind of why you are an artist. [00:30:01.14] I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t completely go away. I\u2019m sure obviously it\u2019s gotten so much <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB1\">better that yeah, of course, I\u2019m sure I get even I agree with you on that. I\u2019m just saying part of the reason I think it gets better in my case, that\u2019s why I stopped, even before I saw you, I stopped having major panic attacks because I found those like you know what? I yeah, I get panic attacks. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB2\">It could happen right now as I\u2019m sitting here, right now. Right? It\u2019s almost like I started just making that part of who I am, and then suddenly I got less and less panic attacks. So I don\u2019t you know what I mean? Now I guess in a it\u2019s just semantics, so I guess it did go away. I don\u2019t know. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB3\">I just feel like that\u2019s just kind of a part of my it\u2019s just a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">THERAPIST: The fabric of your being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s just a part of my fabric, yeah, yeah. And then as an artist, I don\u2019t think you can ever you\u2019re lying if you don\u2019t want some validation. Art is about and even with Okay Stupid, right, it\u2019s because art is about artifice, on some level. [00:31:06.21] It is about beauty and about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF1\">so I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but I also think [inaudible] for any [inaudible] that\u2019s actually...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, but I\u2019m saying for artists in particular it\u2019s even more of a you know what I mean? Because generally they are more sensitive. Generally they are more fucked up even. Or generally they are more focused on beauty and this and that. So and generally they\u2019re more anxious and depressed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C31\">So that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it could all go away, of course. It could get better and better. I\u2019m just saying I think part of the reason it could go away is when someone says yeah, it\u2019s just I\u2019m going to have some days, I think, when I feel a little panicky or whatever. I mean I never maybe I never <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C32\">will again. But the fact that someone says that yeah, I could I still when I\u2019m in a crowded place sometimes I suddenly feel anxious or whatever, just saying it even though it never has happened, it hasn\u2019t happened in years and years and years, in a way that\u2019s part of why it\u2019s not happening. [00:32:10.07] <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C33\">You know what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yes, I do. I mean I another way of putting that, though, that I think actually is a deeper change happening than you\u2019re giving it credit for, is that what is happening when you get to say yeah, sometimes I have panic attacks is that your shame about who you are is starting to lessen. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C51\">that doesn\u2019t have to be something, then, to be so terrified about saying out loud, saying it to yourself. It\u2019s not that big a deal anymore if it can be spoken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: Right. That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Like saying you\u2019re an artist, actually getting that to be a real spoken thing that you say to people, that is your identity. Instead of something you have to feel ashamed over or compromising around or wasn\u2019t good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. No, I totally agree. That\u2019s I mean that\u2019s instead of clich\u00e9, right, that\u2019s like a paradigm shift, right? [00:33:04.22] That\u2019s like a very internal deep, deep shift in how you define yourself. Yeah, that\u2019s true. So wait, does and so it all makes sense now, what you said? That <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB1\">original thing that you said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I mean I think we\u2019re agreeing that you\u2019re saying right now there\u2019s a different thing, a new thing happening, where it\u2019s not just that you\u2019re turning back looking for validation, but I\u2019m only picking up now on the subtler like moment by moment places where I actually think there <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD1\">might be a day where you don\u2019t even have to tell me people are...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">CLIENT: I suddenly get what you\u2019re saying.

The fact that I have to verbalize that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that I\u2019m totally and I catch myself with that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s gotten better and better. I absolutely, absolutely. Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And not even catching it, like but catching it and getting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, I just mean in a way where I can I do exactly...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re understanding it more, yeah.

I might say that yeah, Okay Stupid, but I\u2019ll also know like it\u2019s hard to because these things happen so quickly in your mind. It\u2019s like a millisecond. But I\u2019ll it\u2019s just what you said. I\u2019ll just be like wait, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">why am I telling you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re following...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E5\">THERAPIST: ...motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not trying to tell like I better not be telling these people this because I want them to think that I\u2019m so cool with the ladies or something. You know what I mean? So I agree with you. I totally agree with you. Sometimes we articulate things without realizing that we want a certain response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Why we\u2019re doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And again, the implicit thing there is that you wouldn\u2019t know that I would know that people are following you on Okay Stupid.

[00:35:03.17] If I didn\u2019t tell you, you wouldn\u2019t think that oh, Arto\u2019s [ph] a handsome guy that probably gets a lot of attention from women.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s not the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">CLIENT: Of course.

Yeah, because that\u2019s years of feeling like okay, I guess if no one\u2019s going to tell me I\u2019m cute I gotta somehow make sure they know that I\u2019m you know what I mean? It\u2019s a childish not childish, but it\u2019s a childhood you feel like you want someone to say, well <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB1\">you look nice or whatever. It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Because it wasn\u2019t a given.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, and as much as it\u2019s been like a 180 now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: But you\u2019re right. No, I think it\u2019s exactly because it\u2019s changed so much that in those moments of yeah, I totally get it. I mean either if you bring it up or if I\u2019m out and about, why did I. Even if I don\u2019t get it in that minute I\u2019ll be like hmmm, why did I so like with my Assyrian friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">now I\u2019ve realized when I talk to them about this, I don\u2019t the other way that it can become healthier is I just talk about it like it\u2019s like in a joking, half joking way. [00:36:21.11] Do you know what I mean? Like I just embrace it. Yeah, it is kind of crazy that, yeah, I guess I do kind of date <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201032\">a lot sometimes and but that\u2019s not because I\u2019m great. It\u2019s kind of funny and like I almost embrace the with my these older Assyrian guy friends I play that role of just being a guy and whose boobies are firmer and because it\u2019s just fun and funny. But I don\u2019t I no longer am trying to none <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201033\">of it is like disingenuous. You know what I mean? Or if I\u2019m on the phone with my friend Scott and I\u2019m being more serious about it, I\u2019ll just be honest. [00:37:05.10] You know what I mean? I also slip in I find myself slipping in real things like I\u2019ll be like I mean I\u2019ve been doing that for a while <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201034\">now, which is good, but I\u2019ll say things like yeah, it\u2019s nice, like I feel grateful. I\u2019d say that a lot. Like I don\u2019t know, I feel grateful. I don\u2019t know. These chicks somehow think it\u2019s nice or whatever. Like much more there\u2019s a lot more honesty in things I say, or I\u2019ll say things like yeah, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201035\">haven\u2019t I\u2019m supposed to see this chick, this yeah, she\u2019s really hot, whatever, but honestly, I just want to stay at home with Sophie.

Like I\u2019m much more...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: Which is its own form of acknowledging there\u2019s something else going on there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And it\u2019s nice but then it actually makes me sometimes even sadder because then it\u2019s all these chicks but not nothing is <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B1\">so it makes me it almost makes you feel lonelier in a weird way and all that stuff.

But it can make it look like it\u2019s worse and [inaudible] it just means you\u2019re getting to notice more of what was there all along.

[00:42:07.29] Why the fuck do I feel like I have a cold? Why do I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201371\">a dry cough, like an itchy throat? But I\u2019m not getting sick. So it\u2019s an allergy? What the fuck. Like it\u2019s just all this stuff . Getting much more attuned to like if someone mentions an illness or something, having a mini like I don\u2019t want to fucking I\u2019m doing well today. I don\u2019t want to hear about <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201372\">cancer and so that\u2019s the one thing that. I think it\u2019s that like don\u2019t get too happy because something bad\u2019s going to happen. And I don\u2019t want to be that way. That\u2019s not because that means that no matter what you\u2019re secretly, if nothing else you\u2019re still wound up about this one fucking thing.

[00:43:21.05] <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201391\">You\u2019re already in the place where things aren\u2019t good inside or externally.

That\u2019s, I think, what a lot of this writing is about, or going to be about, or whatever, is that, well, like I mean that\u2019s a fucked up thing, that since I was 19 I\u2019ve had I mean in a way it\u2019s an optimism. [00:44:19.13] <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201431\">In a way it\u2019s actually an uplifting thing because the fact that I\u2019ve even accomplished anything, and these aren\u2019t little things, the book, the records, getting in this fucking cluster fuck. Forget about finishing, getting in to these places, getting to the places I\u2019ve been, traveling, whatever, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201432\">amazing because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been dealing with, is that I know very well or I\u2019ve become better and better on a deeper level now. I understand what I\u2019m really capable of and it\u2019s way beyond I get my potential now. I think I get it. And it\u2019s really a lot. I think I can do really amazing things on <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201433\">a forget about what other people I don\u2019t give a shit. I know that I can. The sadness and the hope it\u2019s like sad and happy at the same time. But the thing is that I haven\u2019t gone all the way in a lot of these things because of that, exactly what you\u2019re say I get I see that more and more. [00:45:30.07] <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201434\">Every year I see that. Why? Because I\u2019m scared that once of course I know what my potential is. But if I had stayed in Europe and married Julia [ph] and had a nice little life with her happy little European parents who are well to do and we\u2019re having a nice life, then something bad\u2019s going to happen. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201435\">You know what I mean? Or if I finish my novel and it gets published and I go on a book tour, suddenly I\u2019m living the life I wanted to live, something bad\u2019s going to happen. Or...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20142-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20142-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20145\">THERAPIST: Because it did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20147\">CLIENT: Because it did, exactly, exactly. Or if I married Meredith, because I imagined a perfect girl that I wanted and then I found her, right? That\u2019s that can\u2019t happen. You know what I mean? So that\u2019s on the one hand, because I have my grandmother\u2019s wacky optimism, on the one hand I see that as <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201471\">a great track record that okay, well then that means that\u2019s just who I am so that will, in different forms that\u2019ll keep happen if it\u2019s not the book it\u2019ll be the record. If it\u2019s not Meredith it\u2019ll be some other nice person that I meet who is amazing or whatever. [00:46:39.27] But the difference is <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201472\">now I gotta start embracing those things and seeing them through instead of just manife because really that\u2019s me. I\u2019m fucking manifesting this shit. Like I\u2019m my own life coach. People are telling me not to be a poet and I\u2019m like oh no, I\u2019ll just go publish with the most prestigious press in Europe. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201473\">And I don\u2019t even know how the fuck that happened, but I made it\u2019s like I willed it against all odds to happen. Or this place, whatever. It\u2019s like all right, fine, you guys want me to go to college and fine, I\u2019m going to go to the best one. I might not finish it but like I\u2019m willing these bigger things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201474\">symbolic things, to happen. The difference is, though, the next step is then to really embody those things and build on them and just that\u2019s your life now. Instead of like more like pinball where it happens but then I\u2019m recoiled by...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20149\">THERAPIST: Or willing it sort of against all emotional [inaudible ] It\u2019s very different. [00:47:44.12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, then again, it\u2019s not just the external stuff but my own yeah, that you don\u2019t deserve this, how did this even happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2014D\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s like it\u2019s remarkable but it\u2019s as much has happened has and yet it also shows how much more could happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2014F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. The difference now, though, is that I don\u2019t get as depre like now I just look forward to those other things that are going to happen. You know what I mean? Instead of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20151\">THERAPIST: Starting to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. No, of course. It\u2019s not a lot of work to be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20155\">THERAPIST: I mean this thing, even, with the mortgage could\u2019ve felt like a minor repetition, Arto, I could imagine. Like a little trauma in the way it played out. But this like things are going to be okay and then they\u2019re not okay. [00:48:38.06] All of a sudden getting hope up and then the fear that <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201551\">something bad\u2019s going to happen and it happens. It\u2019s not actually that. It\u2019s more just the reality of mortgages and [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20157\">CLIENT: Before we finish I had a question. Are there any good like what all these things I\u2019m describing, these main things, the like has someone written like has a psychologist or psychiatrist written like, you know what I mean? Is there something good I can read? Because I do feel weird writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201571\">about it without having some more because a lot of what I\u2019m writing is just based I mean obviously this is a fucking lot of stuff here, but you know what I mean? Like is there something that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20159\">THERAPIST: On trauma? Like this...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015B\">CLIENT: Something that somehow might speak to these things that I\u2019m articulating. [00:49:31.24]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N2015A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561576\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Yes. It\u2019s just so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2015F\">CLIENT: Is it very like medical and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20161\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not medical. And there are a lot of [inaudible] authors who speak to this. But probably 50 of them. So I don\u2019t know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20163\">CLIENT: Okay. I\u2019ll do some research and see what yeah, okay. Because I just it would be cool if you\u2019re going to write a whole thing like a it just would be nice to read like what do people. Because I want to say something, but then someone like you or someone who knows is going to read it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201631\">go, well yeah, that\u2019s this thing that you\u2019re describing. Do you not know what that is? You know what I mean? Like it\u2019s just good to understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and yet I also I mean there\u2019s more for us to look at this question even [inaudible] You will capture it, Arto, in a way that a psychoanalyst never would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, I get that. But I\u2019m almost I\u2019m just curious, like so I don\u2019t know. [00:50:32.15] I feel like it\u2019s nice to know what you\u2019re...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20169\">THERAPIST: The area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2016B\">CLIENT: Just a little bit, to understand like I don\u2019t know. Maybe not. Yeah, maybe you\u2019re right. Sometimes, yeah, that\u2019s always the trick with writing. Sometimes you just gotta write it and not worry about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2016D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what like I can even come up with a bibliography to give you if you would really want that, but I think there\u2019s still the question of like is that a version of not trusting your own voice and experience [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, forget it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20171\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? Like I would actually worry about those diluting what it is you would know artistically and internally. Not necessarily. Of course writers do research in the area...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20173\">CLIENT: You\u2019re right. I could do plenty of research after it\u2019s written. I mean editing or whatever. Yeah, yeah. No, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. The story\u2019s already so insane that the telling of it is the important part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20175\">THERAPIST: So next week then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20177\">CLIENT: What are we doing next week?
