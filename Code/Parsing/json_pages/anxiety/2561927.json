I was like I probably would assume that there is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: You e-mail me and I can respond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: No. I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Obviously chatting in the doorway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: No, actually I was like I\u2019m (unclear) e-mails, like no, no, no. That sounds stupid to send an e-mail \u2013 appointment today question mark? She\u2019s going to think that you don\u2019t write these things down. And I do every now and then. And I was like, \u2018okay, I\u2019m going to check my \u2013 because I write them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">down in my checkbook. I\u2019ve been consistent about that and I was like oh I do have an appointment today. I was like okay. And so that solved that problem. Actually I did try and leave earlier. I don\u2019t know what happened. I mean, well I started getting ready a little bit earlier but it could have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">I took a little bit longer. But I tried to get out of the house. It might have just been the luck of the T. But it is something that I\u2019m trying to get better at is leaving the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And last week I didn\u2019t leave the house at all so it was like an all-time low and part of it was I don\u2019t know what their reason was but I broke out in a very kind of \u2013 well, it was very bad acne like all over my neck and I don\u2019t know, I felt very self-conscious and I didn\u2019t want \u2013 I mean it was hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">for me to get ready because I\u2019d start freaking out and sometimes when Jeremy and I would \u2013 I mean the whole last week if he was in with me as I was washing my face I would freak out and get very grumpy and I mean I just get really frustrated because sometimes it\u2019s not a function of \u201coh, I forgot to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">wash my face\u201d. I mean I wash my face twice a day, exfoliate twice a day, use prescription Retinol on my face and I just get frustrated and I \u2013 I mean I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve used topical prescriptions since I was a kid and antibiotics on my face up until my face got antibiotic-resistant and so I mean it\u2019s nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">new to have, I mean my face used to not be as sensitive or problematic and over the past few years it\u2019s just a frustrating thing to have to think about it. I mean it\u2019s not to the point where, yeah, and I\u2019ve tried to see a dermatologist at Brown and they weren\u2019t very helpful. They recommended something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">that didn\u2019t work and so I mean at this point I\u2019m still trying to do my own research \u2013 trying to change my diet and \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: How noticeable is the breakout to other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well, if I don\u2019t put makeup on it\u2019s kind of noticeable, I mean, especially around my neck. I mean right now it\u2019s kind of all \u2013 it\u2019s not as noticeable \u2013 I mean, I\u2019ve seen pictures where the acne is bleeding, even with it \u2013 it\u2019s horrible so I admit I am a little bit of a drama queen about it and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mainly, you\u2019re sensitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I would say!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d use the words, \u201cdrama queen,\u201d but I\u2019m wondering sort of how closely your perception aligns with the perception that other people have of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Of a more critical of yourself than others would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I wonder if that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, yeah and I\u2019m definitely, I know I am, I tend to be very critical over every, even enlarged pores, and \u2013 sorry, headache, ouch \u2013 and so and I also realized that that leads me to try and I know that most people aren\u2019t looking at every individual bump, nor <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">do they have time, but I try to pick at my face, partly because that\u2019s what I did since I was young. But my mom did when she was \u2013 she would pick at our faces and just say, \u2018oh.\u2019 I mean I guess that\u2019s sort of \u2013 I guess what some people do is they prefer to so it\u2019s sort of a very learned task whenever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">I\u2019m emotionally upset I go pick at my face and I know that probably makes things worse because it creates scars and I think he that\u2019s sort of what I get embarrassed of because the scars take forever to heal and I know that a lot of these are sort of self-imposed so that\u2019s something that \u2013 my sister <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">recommended putting up a sign like \u201cdon\u2019t pick\u201d and I don\u2019t know if signs work for me because it\u2019s just sort of a \u2013 it reminds me because I just recently saw Joan to get a re-prescription for the \u2013 I guess it is an anti-depressant, yeah. Citalopram and to follow up with that. And she recommended \u2013 she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200274\">said that some students are writing on a piece of paper \u2013 \u2018what should I be doing with my time?\u2019 Or, \u2018what can I do with this time?\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking, well, for some reason like that as a sign seems very arbitrary to me. I mean if I put up a sign, \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d, or Jeremy put up a sign, \u201cdon\u2019t bake <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200275\">or broil\u201d, on the oven to make sure \u2013 you can turn up the temperature but if it\u2019s not on \u201cbake\u2019, if it\u2019s on \u201cbroil,\u201d it won\u2019t heat up the oven. It will just sort of burn on the broiler. So you have to sort of switch over \u2013 even though there are two buttons \u2013 they\u2019re not continuous. You have to change <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200276\">whether you want bake or broil, and the temperature. And I always forget. And his sign sometimes helps. I mean it\u2019s not right on the \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s beside the oven because you can\u2019t put it on the thing. But I mean these signs \u2013 I don\u2019t take them like traffic signs. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561927\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t obey quite as readily, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: No, no. And I sort of see \u2013 I was talking to my colleague, Paige, who has been having a hard time coming in. She\u2019s in a (unclear) group and she also got a scholarship and we were teaching together last semester and we always saw each other and now she never comes into the office and she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">talking to me like you know, \u2018oh, it\u2019s really hard just even to get out, to take that shower (unclear) stopping. I realize that you had no \u2013 no I understand.\u2019 And I was giving her advice. I don\u2019t want to make her feel sad or like she\u2019s being judged or anything, because I\u2019m far from perfect. But I gave <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">her the advice that when she\u2019s trying to leave for something, whether it\u2019s a coffee shop and give yourself something to look forward to. And for me, my plans are actually, I saw it happen to them when I didn\u2019t water them all week last week and they were just \u2013 and then I realized that I really have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">to, I mean coming in is actually starting to come natural \u2013 after I spent all week last week at home I just really did not feel productive. And my cat started to rely on me as his playmate and I realized yesterday when I stayed in my office \u2013 I got there around 3:45 because I had an event and then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B4\">stayed there until 9:30. But coming home late, my cat \u2013 I guess he\u2019s learned, I\u2019m trying to think like maybe it was just a one day occurrence, but he really didn\u2019t seem this morning to be as reliant on me as his playmate, so I was wondering if I start \u2013 animals are as routine as humans are and if he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B5\">starts to realize that I\u2019m gone half the day he\u2019s not going to (unclear) you know, get used to that and I\u2019ll get used to that. I mean I think that\u2019s what I really told Paige that you have to make a routine out of it and that\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m trying to do now, especially after I had my week off of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B6\">realizing what it\u2019s like when I don\u2019t go. That\u2019s just something getting used to coming in and I just realize how important it is to leave home. At least it feels somewhat more productive or like there\u2019s a moment of focus, a moment of \u2013 I mean there are so many distractions at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561927\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Did you not leave for racquetball or yoga, also? [00:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I left for pretty much after Tuesday, after racquetball, I only did yoga on Friday and I didn\u2019t leave for racquetball either on Thursday or \u2013 there were so many days I was going to leave for racquetball and then it came to Friday and I was just like, \u2018okay, I\u2019m really feeling like wow, I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">need to do yoga.\u2019 And it did make me feel better. And then I just sort of realized that staying at home was not a good idea. It\u2019s almost like I got sick of hiding at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Which I think feels a little bit different than staying at home. But it sounds like you felt ashamed and uncomfortable with your appearance and you\u2019re not just staying home but kind of hiding there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: It has a slightly different flavor to it, kind of a normal day when you just feel like you don\u2019t want to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I actually had a meeting with my advisor on Wednesday but I cancelled because I freaked out about my face. I mean I didn\u2019t tell him that but I just claimed that I had a stomach flu and I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: And that doesn\u2019t feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, it doesn\u2019t. Because A \u2013 I lied. And B \u2013 I don\u2019t know when he\u2019s coming back and I was really pissed about that that I did and I was like why \u2013 I mean and once since I didn\u2019t have results, but it was sort of like when else is he going to be available? So now I have to track him down. So it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">\u2013 so I saw that there are so many emotional barriers to my appearance and sometimes I get frustrated because \u2013 Jeremy doesn\u2019t mention it. Sometimes he\u2019ll say I\u2019m pretty but it\u2019s not sort of, like I don\u2019t give him a pat on the back \u2013 or he doesn\u2019t give me a pat on the back. Like the sort of encouragement <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">I give him, especially now, about going through the money crunch and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: What do you want him to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I guess \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I mean I guess there\u2019s really not much he could really say. I mean he did say, \u2018I don\u2019t notice it.\u2019 You know, \u2018I don\u2019t notice it with the makeup.\u2019 And it\u2019s okay we can mask together \u2013 I\u2019m getting into mask now. We can mask together and clear up together. I mean he\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">one to (laughs) \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: So you wanted him to recognize how upset you felt even though he doesn\u2019t see it the same way you do, but to say like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel so upset about it.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. And to say, \u2018it\u2019s understandable but you\u2019ve got to realize that no one cares.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like you care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I do care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not \u201cno one\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561927\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s somewhere finding a way to sympathize or empathize with what you\u2019re feeling even though he doesn\u2019t feel the same way about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: So really, it\u2019s sympathizing. Because empathizing is when you can feel what someone else feels. He doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t see \u2013 his reality of what you look like at that moment or what you look like now in your reality of how you feel you look are different. So yeah, maybe \u2013 just like with weight. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">I mean I think it\u2019s the same thing. When you looked in the mirror and saw somebody who needed to lose weight \u2013 objectively, that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 isn\u2019t the case. I think some of this other appearance stuff is very similar \u2013 that the image that you hold is not necessarily what is reflected to other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean I definitely do freak out quite a bit about it and that\u2019s something that I do need to not freak out so much such that I\u2019m cancelling appointments with my advisor and hiding. And so that\u2019s one thing that I need to \u2013 sort of a phobia that I need to have to sort of work through <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">and I think maybe that \u2013 like making myself come in at least every day. At this point I\u2019m not so concerned with what time I\u2019m getting in as long as I\u2019m getting in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Having that routine of having some face time at the office. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019ve made it quite cozy, especially because my plants are all there. Once I watered them I had to go there this Sunday and water them. They perked back up. They really did. They didn\u2019t die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: They perked back up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, they did. Fortunately, they are a five dollar loss but there\u2019s three of them so that\u2019s $15. And Jeremy\u2019s dad came this weekend and it was a lot of fun to have him around. We had him on Saturday and also Sunday. There were no plans for him on Sunday after because he came for Ozzie\u2019s (sp?) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">thirty-second birthday and sort of just like nice to come for the spring and so it was really fun. We played cards. We talked. We sort of \u2013 all three of us \u2013 sort of laid on a couch. Jeremy and I shared a couch and he had another couch \u2013 kind of what you would do looking at the stars \u2013 we were inside <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">because it was too cold, but it was a lot of fun. And Sunday we weren\u2019t supposed to \u2013 I mean there were no plans but I was just sort of going to go with my mom and sit on my mom\u2019s couch which \u2013 I was like, you know, \u2018well, you can come along with us.\u2019 Went along and ran errands and was able to go to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B3\">yoga on Sunday which for me wasn\u2019t \u2013 I wished it was a more \u2013 it was a substitute and I wish it was more energizing. We were less meditative because I have a hard time \u2013 I mean I \u2013 reason I go to yoga is not for a spiritual reason. It\u2019s for \u2013 well I play racquetball and I need some other physical activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">But nevertheless, I do find yoga very empowering and to be able to do a handstand and I\u2019m normally a weak little sister, it is very empowering to sort of feel that strength I don\u2019t necessarily feel with racquetball. It feels almost like a \u2013 I don\u2019t do racquetball enough to really be improving quite <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">what I would sort of dream to. Like if I was 16 years old again and I was exercising 17 or 20 hours a week, is a lot different than three hours or maybe three plus four and a half, five hours a week. So sometimes I get frustrated but with yoga it\u2019s a change of pace and sometimes I feel a little frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D2\">because I\u2019m not \u2013 my legs are strong but not in the \u2013 everything for me. Like I want to turn out my legs because I don\u2019t want it to be counterproductive to build up strength and parallel \u2013 and I turn my feet in san ho sometimes I get a little frustrated. And plus also my legs are much more advanced <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D3\">and strong and skillful than my arms so the yoga classes trying to find the right fit has been just sort of \u2013 or how to get the most out of every yoga class, but I find it a good \u2013 I find it a very \u2013 I like it. I like being able to try \u2013 I\u2019ve been trying to get in three or four exercise classes a week <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D4\">just so that I feel \u2013 if I feel like I\u2019m in better health then I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m such a blah. And so that\u2019s been certainly a new constant thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561927\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">But, yeah \u2013 Jeremy\u2019s dad came. But he told me on Monday that \u2013 because there\u2019s been a big money crunch at Jeremy\u2019s job and they might have to skip another pay and that\u2019s not cool. And I they eventually like come May when they do have the renewals for their insurance they will have \u2013 like there will <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">be income. It\u2019s just sort of a cash crunch on \u2013 you know there were just no sales last year. And Jeremy\u2019s been getting frustrated because he does a lot of the work and his brother does a lot of the work and the mom doesn\u2019t do any of the work and how do you deal with the fact that if they fire the mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">then she\u2019s going to be yelling, screaming and upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: Who holds control of the company?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: All three of them are partners and what the business is now is not what the mom started out doing and so the mom originally ran the company and now it\u2019s a different transaction rather than just insurance and having someone else finance and deal with it or not finance it and \u2013 they actually have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">\u2013 Jeremy has built up models with Ozzie (sp?) in order to finance it and that\u2019s what they really sell themselves on but the mom hasn\u2019t learned to do that. She doesn\u2019t know the financing bit to any extent and often to the business calls some of the clients don\u2019t want her to come. And so it\u2019s frustrating <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">because they are all three partners it\u2019s really hard to fire your mom and a partner and why is she a partner? Because she sort of started the company \u2013 and so and it\u2019s really frustrating for Jeremy because he\u2019s sort of and even feels to the extent that when the mom spends money on non-approved purchases, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200633\">that it\u2019s embezzling. For instance, she\u2019ll \u2013 she used to fly to Denver to say it was on business and it\u2019s not. It\u2019s to visit her friends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">And so Jeremy \u2013 I mean, he was really frustrated about it last night and I mean I totally get it, but it was frustrating because I\u2019ve been frustrated with my own research and it felt like an airing of grievances last night, it\u2019s like the Seinfeld, the \u201cFestivus\u201d where you have an airing of grievances <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">and like well I think, this is my day \u2013 it sucked more than yours. And I\u2019m like \u2013 well, you know, okay, I get it. I know it\u2019s a Catch-22 and I\u2019m sorry. And then he tried looking at my data and he made it worse, he actually made me feel worse because he\u2019s like, \u2018oh yeah, they differ a lot. I was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">like oh, well they\u2019re pretty much the same up until out of the lines \u2013 what happens is I\u2019m trying to prove this paper right or wrong and they have one result that I don\u2019t doubt is wrong. Actually, I do but I doubt how they got their result but that\u2019s not the part I\u2019m trying to prove right or wrong or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200653\">debunk. It\u2019s sort of the common ground I\u2019m trying to make common and straighten out. It\u2019s very similar. I can\u2019t figure out the error \u2013 if it\u2019s my error or their error but even the person, Jose, who\u2019s was at one point working doing what I do but he isn\u2019t anymore, he had a program and he did it \u2013 calculated <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200654\">it a different way and he got the same results so I have sort of a feeling that if two people are wrong then something \u2013 maybe it\u2019s just our ways are similar but he just used different codings. I\u2019m thinking that mainly it\u2019s just follow their exact instructions on how they did it even if it seems unnecessary <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200655\">so I mean at the last point I mean I guess I talked to my advisor but since he doesn\u2019t do any of the calculations, it\u2019s frustrating because I find myself very frustrated at this point because in order to move forward, I mean because I\u2019ve almost \u2013 I\u2019ve been refining little bits in the introduction and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200656\">in the background component and it\u2019s going to be a 20-page paper but I can\u2019t move forward until I get those things to agree and it feels kind of like (unclear) you can\u2019t pass something until something else \u2013 you know, they can\u2019t go forward until this little thing passes and so I mean, and a lot of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200657\">is I mean, these programs take 20-30 minutes, maybe 30 minutes to an hour to run and so it\u2019s a very time-consuming process and I also found that \u2013 I mean that\u2019s one thing that I found is that because these things take so long I can be doing other things in the meantime like finishing up the background <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200658\">section and managing the project, but if I\u2019m at home I often just surf the Internet and play with the cat.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561927\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t work as efficiently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that\u2019s one thing I sort of saw especially at this difficult time \u2013 you know when there are little calculations you need to make and I need a book from the library but it\u2019s very hard to access that book from the library when I\u2019m at home. And the other thing I realized is that \u2013 well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">I realized this for a while, but I\u2019ve lost my student ID. I don\u2019t know where I lost it but it really is my access into the Department and to the library. Because I was actually \u2013 when we were going to my office on Sunday because I had to water my plants and was showing Jeremy\u2019s dad \u2013 he went to Brown <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200692\">so he was reminiscing. But he was like, \u2018boy, I would think it would be pretty handy to have that student ID. And I was just like, I felt like saying \u2013 \u2018shut the F up.\u2019 I know, like I mean, yeah. Because we had to ask a fellow researcher outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: To get into your office?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. They lock it up like Fort Knox, but I really see that it is something. And it reminds me that there are little things in my life like paying your credit card bill and seeing how like my credit card \u2013 I pay it willy-nilly like when I pay it it\u2019s no correspondence to the actual date that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D1\">it closes on a statement date. And some reason I never \u2013 like I sort of have an idea that I have a closing date and then you pay off the credit card so the closing date when it closes is not when I get my paycheck \u2013 so I just pay when I get my paycheck and so I realize \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561927\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Racking up interest fees?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Fortunately, I only racked up $7 so far. But sometimes I don\u2019t and sometimes I do so Jeremy talked it over with me and said, \u2018well it\u2019s good that you\u2019re paying, like you\u2019re paying it off in some form but you can\u2019t just pay it off willy-nilly.\u2019 And I sort of realized, okay \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: Like sending yourself bottles of nail polish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah! I know!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) you might be getting something for, instead, it\u2019s going Unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. So I was really worried when I showed him because I didn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ve never processed how a credit card worked. It\u2019s kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of random but you do it for their benefit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not completely logical. But it is how it works. So it\u2019s interesting because you know as I listen to you talk about these different areas of your life one of \u2013 details are a theme that kind of get in your way because some details that aren\u2019t really that important to you, you pay a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">of attention to. And details that maybe do have more consequence, somehow don\u2019t get paid attention to. So it\u2019s like the filter how you determine what you\u2019re going to focus on and what you\u2019re going to let go, is misdirected. Because the size of your pores \u2013 that\u2019s a small detail and it doesn\u2019t actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F2\">have much consequence on your life if we look at it objectively. However, when you choose to focus on it it can become something that ends up having a big impact on your life because it becomes really upsetting for you. Whereas something like losing your school ID has a pretty big impact \u2013 it makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F3\">your life so much less convenient. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes, it does (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m not judging what you\u2019re paying attention to. It certainly is \u2013 it\u2019s just that if we think about it from my favorite perspective of what\u2019s adaptive, what\u2019s working for you and what\u2019s working against you \u2013 filtering important detail to focus on and detail that I can just let slip by, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200831\">it\u2019s going to really be helpful to you because if we choose to focus on the details that are adaptive \u2013 what\u2019s going to work for you and let go of things that are going to work against you, I think you\u2019ll find that things are a lot smoother. So like the credit card date. It\u2019s a detail that if you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200832\">schedule your bank to pay your credit card automatically two days before the closing date it\u2019s going to be really efficient for you and will work for you rather than work against you. And things that don\u2019t actually harm you \u2013 just like with (unclear) thinking about what\u2019s gross but not harmful. Same <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200833\">thing with little blemishes or pores \u2013 they\u2019re not really going to harm you. You may not like it when things aren\u2019t as smooth as can be but it\u2019s not going to harm you so it\u2019s something that you can kind of let go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">CLIENT: No, and I think it might be something I\u2019m going to have Jeremy make sure that I do is write down what sort of are my priorities because the reason I did good in school was not necessarily \u2013 I mean the reason why I worked so hard and focused while I was an undergrad \u2013 it was not just because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">oh, this is what I\u2019m supposed to do \u2013 it was because of a very \u2013 you know, I wanted to prove to myself that I was smart enough to do it and part of it was the fear that I wasn\u2019t smart enough. So it was very emotionally charged that I do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561927\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: Why do you want to finish now? What\u2019s the motivator now to finishing, to doing well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: And so that\u2019s actually something that I\u2019ve wrestled with a while, I mean part of it is that when everything works out perfectly I find it very interesting and I\u2019m curious to see it is \u2013 the things that I get into, I get very interested to see how they turn out like from a physical dynamic point <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">of view and I think that\u2019s actually the problem that when things aren\u2019t going right and I\u2019m not getting the data there\u2019s not that interesting \u2013 enthusiasm part of it and I\u2019ve sort of lost this motivation to prove oh I\u2019m smart enough and whether or not I \u2013 and that\u2019s just not the priority or the focus <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200892\">and I think that all these other more personal things are coming up like I mean, perhaps it was germs and then I think that\u2019s maybe it might be a point to point out that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever \u2013 I\u2019ve never been able to prioritize and do what was good for me. I did what I wanted and a lot of times <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200893\">that correlated with being a hard-working student and proving myself and every now then then there was the added bonus of I did a good job and I found it interesting. And that was on my research projects, I really did find them interesting. But, in the same sense I sort of \u2013 and that\u2019s the \u2013 I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200894\">maybe that\u2019s the number one problem with when times get tough in my research or there\u2019s no answer or I just want to find out the answer is that I\u2019m not trying to prove myself and I don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s so much of the drive and it\u2019s hard to keep it up unless I\u2019m on like a \u2013 every now and then my advisor <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200895\">will get really excited and then I\u2019ll be excited as well but it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s not exciting to keep up that. And I think I just, I need to think about \u2013 and that\u2019s a problem too with my weakness is that it\u2019s a matter of sort of priorities and what interferes in saying like I would hold \u2013 it used to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200896\">be for bathrooms I would prioritize not going to the bathroom and being in lots of discomfort and now I\u2019ve been able to get over that. But I think a lot of it is that I have these very big, I wouldn\u2019t say obsessions, but I do tend to obsess about these certain things and I can\u2019t let them go and I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200897\">that my inability to prioritize what is important to function and that\u2019s \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I heard you say I have to make sure I have Jeremy make sure I do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: How about, I make sure you do this?
