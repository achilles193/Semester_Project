Alright! Nice! Congratulations!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Thank you. I found out on Wednesday morning so it was \u2013 I didn\u2019t have to wait that long at all. I got the e-mail and it was right before case conference so I was just looking at the e-mail and I was like should I just click on it? What if it\u2019s not good news? The night before I\u2019d had a nightmare <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">that I failed. So it was like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Did you know it was supposed to happen today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well I knew five days after the first of the month it\u2019s released. And then you wait a few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Well, I knew five days after the first of the month it\u2019s released. And then you wait a few days. So I knew it was coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Just not that soon. And so the number \u2013 and I knew what number to look for. So it was like \u2013 wow, it\u2019s done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: All right. Nice. Now you just do the jurisprudence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and just order the license once I pass the jurisprudence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And you can do the jurisprudence soon, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Anytime. As soon as I can afford it, basically. Because that\u2019s another $188, but still like for me \u2013 see I have \u2013 is it $21 $21 in my bank account until the 16th. So. And then I realize that my credit card was almost maxed out even though I had requested more money than I did so I\u2019ve just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">requested again a little bit more. I hope that part of it ends soon. This is all going to be like a nightmare and put it behind me and just start paying off some bills. My boss was like, \u201cgreat, now you can open up a private practice if you need to \u2013 get some hours.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u2018yeah, well, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F2\">money? You know?\u2019 I\u2019ve got to wait a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Well the people sublet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, for really cheap, I hear. So I\u2019ll start thinking about that as soon as things set a little bit more because it\u2019s like bill after bill, you know? And I heard that I have to renew even though everybody\u2019s on the same cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right. So you have to pay \u2013 what is it? You have to pay now and then you have to pay in June again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Something like that, yeah. Which is just ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t prorate it or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I had to do that too. And so your post doc hours start immediately after you defended, right? You don\u2019t have to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: After internship they started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Because you had already defended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. Everything was done. Right. So now I get to look over the post doc applications coming in for the interviews we\u2019re going to have soon for post docs for next year and I get to be on that committee and it just feels so weird reading through letters of recommendation. Some of the letters <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">are from Larry, who is a psychologist at Johns Hopkins who my friend just married, whom I\u2019m friends with. Like it\u2019s weird, like these people are my colleagues and I\u2019m keeping an eye out for people I might want to supervise. It\u2019s just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: (inaudible). [0:06:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. And you know they\u2019re explaining in their statements like, right now I\u2019m doing internship and I want this as a post doc and I\u2019m just thinking like wow, I did that already. It\u2019s just really neat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re on the other side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I never thought I\u2019d get here. And it\u2019s done and my mom was thrilled. She started crying. And Billy was all about business. But I expect Billy to be all about business. He was like, \u2018well alright! So what was the score?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018that\u2019s not going to mean anything to you.\u2019 It reminded <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">me of when I used to bring home a report card and he\u2019s like, \u2018well what\u2019s the A minus in?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Oh. Give me the score.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and then he was like, \u2018alright, so what\u2019s next? Can you open up a practice now?\u2019 Like, let\u2019s get down to it. And my dad called but shortly after like a few days after and he seemed really happy. But again, like remember when he offered to help me out financially? We\u2019re still waiting or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">that to happen. Poor Dad. He sounds really stressed. He says he\u2019s going through like some financial crisis and he doesn\u2019t have a job yet. So I feel for him. It\u2019s funny. When he called to congratulate me I didn\u2019t bring up like, \u2018wow, Dad, why didn\u2019t you call me for Christmas or New Years?\u2019 That just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F2\">like completely didn\u2019t register.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: It didn\u2019t register. Yeah, that is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: It\u2019s kind of like well, like I\u2019m pretty much back to the way things were with him which is kind of disappointing to me, but it doesn\u2019t surprise me because he always like any time he hurts me so bad it\u2019s just like I can get over it quickly and go back to the way things were. My friend Carly tries <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">to make me feel better. And she\u2019s like, \u2018well it\u2019s not exactly like the way things were because you\u2019re going forward with some new insight, like you\u2019re looking at it differently, you\u2019re recognizing that you\u2019re acting this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but it\u2019s an important kind of observation, I think, about that it will not register for you. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s something that you\u2019re actively trying to kind of push down or something. It just isn\u2019t there. There\u2019s not like a repression. You know. It\u2019s just really, it\u2019s small <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">D \u2013 like everyday dissociation. It\u2019s dissociation.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I don\u2019t know how I was reflecting on my last session here and how I was in so much pain reading that letter I wrote on Christmas and remembering, really sitting with the feeling that I was feeling when he just abandoned me and I could just walk out of here and be, \u2018alright, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">fine.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t stick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: And he disappointed me again recently and so I\u2019ll catch you up. So it was a big celebration kind of weekend because of the N Triple P that Wednesday. I went out karaoke singing with my friends and these are this group of lawyers like my friend Emma and she has good friends, two other lawyers, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">one of them was pregnant so she was up there singing and doing a dance with her belly. It was hilarious. And it was a fun place and I got reminded of why I don\u2019t go out on weekdays anymore because I was like falling asleep on the subway on the way back home. I suffered the next day at work. I\u2019m just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B2\">like too old for that. And then Friday I had a date and Saturday I had a birthday party with friends because I\u2019m back on websites because after the Christmas thing happened \u2013 I told you. I\u2019m back on it and I saw him on it and he kept denying like no I\u2019m not on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Looking for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I was looking for you, yeah. So I went on a date on Friday with a professor, Ph.D., has written six books. I Googled him. European He came here like five years ago. He teaches at Brown. Very smart. We had a lot of e-mail back and forth like from New Year\u2019s on I think. And he seemed very nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">and you know, it\u2019s different from when I used to talk with guys online because I\u2019m behaving. Like I\u2019m not using any kind of inappropriate humor. I\u2019m not being too flirty. Like I\u2019m looking for something serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) what you did before. [0:11:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Right. So I went out with him. I\u2019d kind of given up on the whole package. Like I think before I was very much going for looks. I was trying to prove something to myself. Especially right after the breakup like, \u2018oh wow, look. I used to be with this really unattractive guy, but look, I can get <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">better looking guys if I want to.\u2019 Because I never hadn\u2019t. I\u2019d always been with Kevin. But now, this guy wasn\u2019t bad looking at all. It wasn\u2019t like the ideal. You know? So, we met up. He was very funny. He started off the conversation. He asked me like, \u2018so, you teach at BC.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018no, no. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200832\">I work at the counseling center. I have a psy D (sp?). He was like, \u2018oh, I haven\u2019t heard of a psy D.\u2019 And then I explained and he\u2019s like, \u2018oh, so you\u2019re telling me is what I have is better than what you have.\u2019 As a joke. So that\u2019s kind of how the night started and very nice and a lot of conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200833\">just about our passions relating to like career and our families and there was nothing inappropriate or anything, which before like on dates conversations quickly went to stuff like that. It didn\u2019t with him. And then he kissed me at the end of the night and then he walked me towards the subway and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200834\">he started kind of feeling me up which I thought was a little inappropriate. I even joked and I\u2019m like, \u2018you\u2019re like totally feeling me up right in the middle of the street right now.\u2019 And he said something like, \u2018oh, well you know I have some whiskey at home and I live right around the corner,\u2019 which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200835\">kind of offended me like why would you invite me to a bar right around the corner from your house? Is that just in case we wanted to go back to your house? Like wouldn\u2019t it have been more polite to ask? So where do you live? Maybe we can meet halfway somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Oh.

So we met in a bar that it turns out was right around the corner from his place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Does he know where you live?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I think I had told him that I had just moved to Falmouth. Yeah. And I knew he lived in Boston, but that could be anywhere. And he said something like, \u2018oh I have whiskey. We can go and take some shots.\u2019 And you know like, \u2018if you end up just wanting to stay the night you can stay the night.\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">And I ended up in my head just like getting totally offended like, \u2018wow, this could turn out to just be a one night stand and you totally did not give me the impression that that\u2019s what you were looking for.\u2019 We even joked \u2013 well, I joked in the middle of getting to know each other, I told him how I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">used to not be looking for anything serious, now I am and I\u2019m not interested in one night stands or things like that. And he even made a joke. He was like, \u2018oh, then I\u2019ve got to stop wasting my time. I thought that was what this was.\u2019 And told me like, \u2018no, I\u2019ve been in two relationships very long term <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B3\">and I usually like look for something serious.\u2019 So that kind of disappointed me. I didn\u2019t go home with him. I went home. [0:14:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">Had a good Saturday. Saturday night I was invited to a birthday party out at some bar. So Brian has not seen me since I moved, right? And since he took me to work that day my car was not working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Which is a long way back in what, mid-December?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: I moved to the new place the second week of December, something like that, and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: And you haven\u2019t seen each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: No, except when my car wouldn\u2019t start and I asked him to take me to work and he picked me up and he took me to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: And that was \u2013 when was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Like a week ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: But that was just a ride to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Then I haven\u2019t hung out with him at all. And Friday morning I\u2019m at work and I get a text and he was like, \u2018so, what are you doing tonight?\u2019 And I know any time he asked me that it\u2019s because he wants to hang out. And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018wow, on the one night that I\u2019m busy.\u2019 So I texted him <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">back. I\u2019m busy. Why?\u2019 And then he got all aggressive with me like, \u2018oh, never mind. No sense in telling you since it seems you have plans.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Brian, are you serious? Like you wanted to see me tonight?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018yeah. I\u2019ve got work tonight but I wanted to go see you from like \u2013 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A12\">was going to go right after work until I had to leave at 10.\u2019 My date was at 9. And I was like, well I have plans. I didn\u2019t tell him because like that was going to start a fight. I didn\u2019t tell me what it was but I got really pissed, like what does this guy expect me to just sit at home and suddenly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A13\">surprise, like there\u2019s no rhythm or reason, you know, it\u2019s not like every Saturday we hang out or every Friday we hang out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">So I ended up having to be the adult in that situation and I think I did that by negotiating, by saying, \u2018okay, well tonight doesn\u2019t work out, how\u2019s your day looking for tomorrow?\u2019 I was even willing to compromise. Do you want me to leave a little later to go with my friends? Do you want me to call <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">them and say, \u2018I can\u2019t?\u2019 Like I was even considering cancelling but I didn\u2019t do that. I didn\u2019t think it was fair to me. So he said that the next day, Saturday, he could see me and he could spend the night. And so I got all excited, but then I\u2019m like, wait a minute. I have a birthday party. And I\u2019d told <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">him about it like for the past two weeks. And I said, when are you free? And he said, basically 7 pm Saturday until 7 am Sunday. So I said, awesome. The birthday party\u2019s at 9. Why don\u2019t we go, meet at the place. We can have dinner together before people arrive and then as people come in I can say hi <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A33\">to them, make an appearance and then we can take the rest of the night to talk because I\u2019d been wanting to actually be with him and talk to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: But you said the party was going to be, you guys were going to hang out at the party?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: For a little bit. Yeah. But I mean I don\u2019t even have fun at those things. Like at the most I\u2019ll be like two hours. Like once it gets loud and stuff and you know I had drank like three beers the night before. I wasn\u2019t planning on doing a heavy night of drinking. I would have been fine with half <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">the night there, half the night for him, because I miss him. So that was a compromise I made. And he was quiet and then I said to him, please \u2013 it will be like a real date night. I\u2019d really, really like that. Please can we do that? And he was like, \u2018okay.\u2019 And I was like \u2013 smiley face, smiley face. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">Exclamation mark! Thank you so much! And going into Saturday I ran errands, did my day, was exercising and then suddenly I got a text. [0:18:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: This is on Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Saturday around 5. And he says, \u2018baby, I have to ask you a question.\u2019 And I knew what was coming. And I wasn\u2019t that disappointed. I noticed, like wow, I\u2019m not even disappointed. In fact it might even be better because I might feel more comfortable around my friends if he\u2019s not around, in case <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">I have to entertain him more, make sure he\u2019s feeling comfortable. So he\u2019s like, \u2018my martial arts teacher asked me to teach a class on Sunday so that means I have to teach the class at 3 and then go to work at 10 which means I won\u2019t have as much time tomorrow, Sunday, to write my paper. Can I use some <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">hours tonight to write my paper and then I\u2019ll come see you after your party? And I said, \u2018of course.\u2019 But I\u2019m thinking, this is his way of getting out of socializing or being out in the world with me. You know? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been complaining to my friend, Carly, about. I\u2019ve been saying, I want someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB3\">that I can have a relationship with. Meaning \u2013 be out in the world with. I don\u2019t want to just meet in my bedroom, have sex, cuddle, and that\u2019s it. Like I want to go out. I want to introduce you to people. I want to do stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What does he know about what your friends know about him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: He just knows that I\u2019ve told them that he\u2019s really busy. That\u2019s he\u2019s a nurse and works night shifts and is in school and has a son. And he\u2019s divorced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: So he knows that he doesn\u2019t think that you\u2019ve led on anybody about him. I was imagining you\u2019d feel very uncomfortable around your friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the reason I\u2019m not doing it. Just in case he ever comes around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Because you feel like you feel for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, like he\u2019s marked, like \u2018oh, it\u2019s that guy that cheated on his wife. =\u2018<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s probably like one thing he\u2019s thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, they don\u2019t know. All they know is he\u2019s really busy and it makes me sad sometimes that he can\u2019t come out more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it also makes me think a little bit about it confronts him that as you were sort of saying like he can kind of have the fantasy or something that it\u2019s just the two of you and it\u2019s not really \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: The real world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not with the real world, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: So I wasn\u2019t that disappointed because I\u2019m used to it and I got dressed up and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: But in some way you felt like it was okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Even better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, maybe in a way, too, it doesn\u2019t just do it to him, it does it to the both of you. It\u2019s like the relationship \u2013 how does it function in the world?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: We don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I lot of mixed feelings. A lot of stirring up of stuff. If you guys were to go out together and like present as a couple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: In a way, too, it kind of relieves some of the tension I might have had about, oh crap, I just went out on a date on Friday.\u2019 Like in my mind I\u2019m saying to myself, \u2018this is why you went out on a date on Friday. Because he\u2019s not giving you what you need.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. And then for him to come it would have been like you would have felt \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Maybe I would have felt a little bit bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I see. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: It would have really surprised me if he would have come at dinner, like mingling with friends. Out in public with a crowd, like and then go home? Like wow, that would have been a date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But yeah, I think it\u2019s also, I think\u2019s it is something also like as you were saying about him socializing. Where you said socializing \u2013 did you mean with your friends or with you \u2013 or both?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I see, yeah. It\u2019s not just about meeting your friends. It\u2019s also about being in public with you or being on a date sort of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like we went to the lounge so they have like 80s night and 90s night sometimes and this girl was turning 40 and she wanted to go there for 80s night and so you know, there was like fun music. It\u2019s like a fun atmosphere. So I can\u2019t picture sitting across the table from Brian with like fun <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">music playing, me maybe having a drink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. He doesn\u2019t drink? Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Not really. Very rarely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: What does it feel like to think about \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Uncomfortable. Like I\u2019m there with my dad or something. Like because he\u2019s all serious. Remember how I told you about like I don\u2019t really like the way he dresses and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I knew that part. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: But I think it goes beyond that. Like he just seems uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: And I think seeing him kind of uncomfortable or just like uptight or quiet, because that\u2019s how he was the one time I took him to a bar where a band was playing and I saw him get a beer, but my friends couldn\u2019t really talk because the music was so loud. I think if I see him uncomfortable then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">I get really stiff and uncomfortable. This happened with Kevin all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Ah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: And so I ended up going to this lounge. All my friends were there. And a lot of my friends have boyfriends and there was this one. He\u2019s like in his 40s. He\u2019s been going out with this girl for a long time. And he\u2019s just so social. Like he\u2019s like dancing around and they\u2019re looking at the football <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">game and buying her drinks and then like mingling over here and offering to take pictures. That\u2019s more of like my personality. Like why do I have to be with these stiff guys all the time that are socially retarded?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. No, right, right. Then it kind of inhibits you in some way to have them be there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I get stiff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not how my friends know me. So I went and it was great because a lot of people had passed the test and like my friend offered to buy me a drink and I was like, \u2018great \u2013 I don\u2019t have to spend any money.\u2019 And there was good music playing. We took some pictures and then they started playing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">Michael Jackson 80s. And like people are starting to get up and dance and they were starting to do things like Thriller and then I get a text from Brian like, \u2018alright \u2013 out of the shower. Heading to your place now.\u2019 [0:24:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">And I\u2019m like, I just got here like a half an hour ago. Do you want to pick me up or do you want me to take the subway?\u2019 I can pick you up. Where are you? And I was like, when you get here why don\u2019t you look for parking? Like it\u2019s casual, come in for a little bit, free parking. And when I get a text <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">when he finally gets there he\u2019s like there\u2019s no parking, I\u2019m outside. And I knew that would happen. So I go from this vibe of people just like being happy and asking what\u2019s going on and telling funny dating stories and dancing to Thriller to outside he\u2019s listening to NPR in his car. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: How about that? Yeah. And what a different way of kind of \u2013 the contrast between the two situations, but also like the contrast between the way these people know you and you know yourself and with being with him. You know? Not just the way he sees you but also how you experience yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">and see yourself, too. It is really to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t want that. Like that\u2019s what I used to have to do with Kevin because of the whole hiding thing? Like my parents can\u2019t find out. Let\u2019s hide our relationship. And I feel in a way that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing with him and I keep doing that to myself and I don\u2019t know why. And then he was mostly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">quiet on the ride home. He doesn\u2019t engage like asking me like asking like, \u2018oh, so whose birthday was it?\u2019 Or, \u2018was it fun in there? Who was there?\u2019 Like he\u2019s \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: What is he like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: He\u2019s quiet and serious. Like, \u2018Hi. How are you?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) and serious. Not like going into that world. You guys don\u2019t go into that other side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. And we get to my house and he kind of goes directly into the bathroom, pees, and then goes directly into the bedroom. And I\u2019m like, don\u2019t you want to see my apartment? Like the last time he saw it there were boxes everywhere and I want to show him how I arranged stuff. And he was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">\u2018oh, yeah, yeah.\u2019 And I turned on the lights and I showed him and then laid down on the bed and put on my PJs and like I cuddled with him because I wanted to hug him because I hadn\u2019t hugged him in forever, it felt like. And there was just not a lot of conversation. There\u2019s so much that could have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201092\">said. There are so many things I wanted to ask him. In fact, the night before when I came home from my date he had texted me when I was on the subway going back home \u2013 he was at work. And he had texted me. He thought I was out with girlfriends and he said, \u2018are you having fun?\u2019 And it\u2019s weird. He must <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201093\">have suspected I was on a date because he never texts me when I\u2019m out. And I said, \u2018yeah, heading home now.\u2019 And then since I had had like three beers, instead of getting angry with him, I tend to get very like cutesy with him and I started writing him something about like I want you to make me a wife <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201094\">and I want to give Logan more playmates \u2013 like something like that. Something just very sincere and he wrote back like, \u2018aww\u2019. And I wrote back, \u2018what do you mean \u201caww\u201d? Like are you belittling me? What does that mean? He was like \u2013 no. That\u2019s endearing. Kind of like, aw, there there. That\u2019s cute.\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201095\">That\u2019s what it feels like every time I say anything like that. And so I was hoping I guess Saturday night \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s also not saying, \u2018I want that too,\u2019 it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: No. Who knows what he wants?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Right. You don\u2019t know (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">CLIENT: And like when we\u2019re laying there I want to ask him, so how\u2019s it going at home? How\u2019s your relationship with your wife? Does she know anything about us yet? Are you ever planning to leave her? Remember when you said like your life will be different once you\u2019re done with school? What do you picture <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201111\">that being like? Do you ever think about us and our future? Or why are you on the dating site again, and have you noticed I\u2019m on it again? Do you want to talk about what that is? There\u2019s so much I wanted to say and like \u2013 silence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">CLIENT: And for the first time like I think I\u2019m growing kind of disenchanted with his approach to sex. Like it was more rough than other times and although I do enjoy that I caught myself in the middle of it thinking like why can\u2019t it ever just be sweet or why can\u2019t I get more of that? Because there <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201151\">are moments that I beg him because I\u2019m in pain. It hurts. And I beg him to like slow down and he does. But it\u2019s very brief. It\u2019s like few and far between, just like every time he disappoints me and actually does stuff like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Not a tenderness to it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: Not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Not enough. But there are sometimes there will be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Okay, but not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I don\u2019t know, I was just like in my head I found myself not so in the moment this time as I normally am and I found myself just kind of thinking like is this worth it. Like, yeah, this feels good and this is fun, but then you have Brian who doesn\u2019t talk about anything. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201211\">where this is going. He can\u2019t be a part of my world and my social circles. Like I\u2019m weighing those two things and \u2013 [0:30:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20120-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20120-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: You know what? I just want to say it because it\u2019s sometimes in my mind about it \u2013 that it would be worth thinking about. I was thinking that Brian has kind of really awoken a part of a side of yourself that you can kind of contact within the sexual realm, you know? It is something about something <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201231\">really personal and important to you. And one way that I think about hi and how he fits into your life is almost analogous to how that side of you fits into your whole life. I don\u2019t mean to get too heavy about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">CLIENT: Like I keep it in secret?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s like it has its own \u2013 it can exist \u2013 almost like it exists in this kind of very protected arena and it\u2019s not yet \u2013 it\u2019s also like it\u2019s not yet ready. It\u2019s not ready to be a part of the rest of you yet. It\u2019s like you want it to be \u2013 you know it\u2019s like you\u2019re sort of saying, \u2018you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201271\">know, I want Brian to kind of come into the light, and you also don\u2019t want to lose it because it\u2019s woken something inside you that\u2019s very important and personal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s not completely integrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s also not something that \u2013 it\u2019s like a part of you that you don\u2019t know what to do with yet. I was thinking about how it\u2019s harder to go there in yourself with these kind of more straight men.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">CLIENT: You mean like how I\u2019m avoiding innuendoes and like I\u2019m trying to behave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about it more along the lines of like the men being too stiff and then it being back in front of you with a problem which is \u2018how can I get into that side of myself with these stiff men?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">CLIENT: Like when I said the word, \u201cvanilla\u201d. Like they\u2019re too nice or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">THERAPIST: Too nice. Yeah. Vanilla. Too milk toast. Like in some way, I don\u2019t know that I could bring that within the rest of me. How does that fit in \u2013 not just with men, with kind of different men but like how does that fit in with the other person you are too? The one, you know? All these other sides. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201331\">It\u2019s like a very important thing that\u2019s been awoken, you know? It\u2019s an area within yourself that you\u2019re still negotiating with yourself how much \u2013 and also you don\u2019t want to let it go. And I think that\u2019s a side of why Brian is also very important to you. Because he does get into something deeply personal <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201332\">and important about how you feel. What makes you feel really alive and in contact with something about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was remembering Saturday night today and I was like I just loved being so close to him. Because like I\u2019d never, in any sexual interaction with anyone, I\u2019ve never felt that close to anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yes! Yeah, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: So yeah. So that part. That\u2019s you, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve never been able to like lose myself in someone else like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think what you\u2019ve also been \u2013 and something that\u2019s been happening has been, you\u2019re really trying to go \u2013 well how does that world fit into the rest of my world? And even you talk about \u2013 wait \u2013 maybe I want that to be more? Well, you\u2019ve always wanted to but it\u2019s really confronting <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">you more and more, this kind of dilemma of I want that, I\u2019m trying to have \u2013 how does that become part of who you are more? How do you kind of invite that into the rest of your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019d like to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20140-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20140-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">THERAPIST: Like almost played out in the exact \u2013 I wanted you to come into the dance party. I wanted you to \u2013 but you had to stay outside. And stay in the car and had to be really serious. How does that fit in with the other Melanie the people know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah. He said something on Saturday night. He was asking me, you know, as he usually does in the middle of sex, like, if I\u2019ve behaved while he\u2019s been away, \u2018because,\u2019 he\u2019s like, \u2018there\u2019s no one supervising you now. You\u2019re living alone. Have you had anyone over?\u2019 And I kept saying, \u2018no.\u2019 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201451\">he didn\u2019t believe me. But then he said, \u2018I don\u2019t care who you sleep with. You can sleep with as many people as you want because I know that I own a part of you that no one else has access to.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">CLIENT: And he\u2019s right. I mean at least for now. He\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve been able to share that with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">CLIENT: And like afterwards, he just wanted to go to sleep and then he woke up. He\u2019s used to waking up at like 5:30 in the morning, so he woke up at 5:30 and that kind of woke me up and we were cuddling and he started looking online on his phone for restaurants that were open that early and I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D1\">\u2018oh, you\u2019re hungry.\u2019 He said, \u2018yeah, I actually forgot to eat dinner. I\u2019m kind of hungry.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018well, if nothing\u2019s open I have eggs. Like I can make you eggs.\u2019 I made him like eggs with feta before and he likes it. And it was amazing to see how difficult it was for this man to ask me for <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D2\">something. He wouldn\u2019t. Like I was like, I\u2019ll stand up like I\u2019m wide awake. It would make me happy to make you eggs.\u2019 And he was like, \u2018no, baby. It\u2019s okay. Maybe I\u2019ll grab something when I leave here.\u2019 And I just stood up and went to go make him eggs and brought him eggs in bed. And he kind of, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D3\">again in a childish kind of way was like, \u2018oh, you know it\u2019s hard for me to ask for things. I don\u2019t want to ask you for anything.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018no, baby, this is how it works. I ask you for things all the time. And you need to be able to ask me too, and it makes me happy when I can make you happy.\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D4\">And kind of in a teasing way he was like, \u2018you\u2019re so healthy.\u2019 Like \u2018you want such healthy communication.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And communication too between different sides of the relationship \u2013 different facets to it. Communication between them as opposed to them being very compartmentalized \u2013 split.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">CLIENT: He\u2019s very split.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">THERAPIST: Well, I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s confronted with. Similar things I think, about I can go there sexually and go and get in contact with an important part of me but I don\u2019t know how to put that with the rest of my life. [0:37:3]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">CLIENT: Right. The previous night \u2013 Saturday night before we became intimate I felt comfortable enough to just ask. I was like, \u2018tell me the truth. Why are you on the website again?\u2019 He\u2019s like, I\u2019m not on the website. I told you, I went on it to look for you. And I was like, but I\u2019ve been on it a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201551\">times this week and I\u2019ve noticed that you were on it. So, seriously, I said like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to get mad. I\u2019m not going to leave you. I just \u2013 I want to understand. Is it because you like the attention? Are you just flirting and that gets you off a little? Or do you like the attention? Tell me. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201552\">he acted like a deer in the headlights. He was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m not on it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Brian, sometimes I see the chat thing on,\u2019 because there\u2019s an option to chat and you can see when it\u2019s on and you can see when it\u2019s off. And I was like, \u2018sometimes I go on it <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201553\">at 6 o\u2019clock at night and chat\u2019s on. I go on at 10 o\u2019clock at night, you\u2019re not on. I go again at 11, you are on. Like, explain that.\u2019 He\u2019s like \u2013 \u2018oh, at home I have all these different things I open \u2013 Mozilla, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome and it must be attached to one of those. So when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201554\">open those programs everything gets opened up.\u2019 And I said something like, \u2018are you afraid that she\u2019s going to find that?\u2019 Like it\u2019s sitting on her computer. And he\u2019s like, \u2018no, no, it\u2019s password protected by screen. Anytime I walk away from it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018are you sure you don\u2019t want to tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201555\">me any other reasons why?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m not on it.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t believe him and I just thought it was so sad. I really don\u2019t believe him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20154-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20154-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean it seems like if you were really trying to open up that space for him to try and communicate whatever\u2019s on that side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not going to judge it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">CLIENT: And he wasn\u2019t able to share with me and that really disappointed me. And what also surprised me was he didn\u2019t ask me, \u2018so why are you on it?\u2019 Or, \u2018why do you keep getting on it?\u2019 I talked to my friend Carly about this and she was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think he wants to know.\u2019 It\u2019s just like asking <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D1\">you for eggs and you say no. Like what if he asks you like why are you on it? I think he knows why I\u2019m on it. I\u2019m basically looking for someone like him that I can be out in the world with. (Pause) The other thing \u2013 my friend Carly had a similar situation once where her boyfriend accused her of being <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D2\">on G-Date or something and her therapist told her something about how when your partner is uncomfortable about something like maybe an app that keeps opening up \u2013 a dating app or something and you don\u2019t mean for it to open, a partner who is not hiding anything and wants their partner to be anxiety-free <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D3\">will like go and remove that app. Like oh, it keeps popping up? Let me get rid of my account or let me delete it, or. And he didn\u2019t even think to do that. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Right. Like he didn\u2019t \u2013 he\u2019s not \u2013 he never closes whatever the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">CLIENT: No. And like he texts me in the morning and he\u2019s been texting me all afternoon like just sweet things. I don\u2019t know what we are. It\u2019s just so confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20163\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20165\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m talking now. So I\u2019m talking now \u2013 like there was a special like $20 for a month on E-Harmony. And did I tell you I have a friend who just got engaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20167\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20169\">CLIENT: She met someone on there and so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they\u2019d known each other briefly, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D\">CLIENT: Like a month. But I kept hearing how \u2013 it\u2019s not like I want to get engaged in a month, but I kept hearing how there\u2019s a lot of questions and it matches you up according to like values and I was like \u2018oh, maybe I have a better chance of connecting with someone like on intellectual, emotional <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D1\">levels who wants the same thing if I get on one of these sites. So I got paired up with a psychologist. He\u2019s a child psychologist. He studied at MSPP and we\u2019ve been e-mailing back and forth. My friend Carly, my friend Maura and my friend, Tiffany, know him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2016C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah. So they can vouch for him and I just \u2013 he asked me for my number so he asked me if it was okay to call this week. Which was very nice. Like taking the steps slowly. So I\u2019m excited about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20173\">THERAPIST: What did they say about that guy? What did they have to say about him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20175\">CLIENT: I just talked to Carly about him. She said, \u2018very solid guy, very smart.\u2019 They didn\u2019t hang out in the same social circles but they have similar classes together. He\u2019s a psy (unclear). He does child and family work. He always had a best friend in the program, a female, who was actually married <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201751\">with a kid and Carly was friends with that girl and that girl used to tell her like, \u2018man, if I was single I would start dating this guy. He\u2019s a good guy.\u2019 He looks kind of nerdy, yet kind of attractive. And he looks very sweet. So. Again, like not the typical look I would go for before. He looks vanilla.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20179\">CLIENT: Kind of what this guy on Friday looked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017B\">THERAPIST: He looked more vanilla then the professor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I\u2019m going with that in my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Of looking for vanilla?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">CLIENT: No. Like that I tend to ex out these vanilla guys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">THERAPIST: Yeah! Uh huh, uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20185\">CLIENT: Maybe that\u2019s not whom I \u2013 I don\u2019t know them. Like they could have a wild side \u2013 like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20187\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting. Like what do you end up looking \u2013 I mean are you talking about the pictures, the profile, or the \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20189\">CLIENT: You can just look at a guy\u2019s profile and think he\u2019s a douche. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018D\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019m thinking about this lawyer guy, the one that I found out was an alcoholic and had a cocaine problem. So attractive. And you can tell by looking at his profile he can sleep with whoever he wants to. He\u2019s like in a suit and just very good looking. And I think he has a picture of himself <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2018D1\">with a bunch of girls and one of him. He might even have one with his shirt off, like he doesn\u2019t write too much in the profile. Like he\u2019s not even interested you know, about disclosing too much about himself, or putting too much effort in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20191\">CLIENT: He doesn\u2019t need to. He\u2019s very good looking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But maybe that sets up a kind of \u2013 I was thinking that in some ways a man like that might not ask a lot of questions or would want to go some places with you, with somebody else while he was looking for \u2013 he\u2019s going someplace without asking a lot of questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20195\">CLIENT: I keep worrying that if I don\u2019t let go of Brian I\u2019ll never be able to open up myself to anyone and I\u2019m also scared that what if you know, I do hit it off with someone, it would hurt me if I was with someone who was still emotionally attached to someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20197\">THERAPIST: Oh, you mean to the other person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah. So. I\u2019m kind of stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Well, it is interesting though. You\u2019re exploring this other \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah I feel like this is the first time I\u2019m going for a different type of guy. And my standards are high like before I \u2013 it always sounds shallow to me when I say this, but like I want to end up with someone who has a graduate degree of some sort. I worked really hard and I value that and so <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019D1\">I\u2019m trying to look at that. Before it\u2019s like I would go out with guys that would maybe did college, got a college degree and were doing something totally not related, weren\u2019t passionate about their career. Someone who gets along with their family, who values relationships with self-aware \u2013 like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019D2\">looking for different things now. So I feel like a difference now in dating.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2019C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561952\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Do you have another date with the Professor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201A1\">CLIENT: Not yet. I\u2019m not getting too invested because he \u2013 the only thing I didn\u2019t like is he said Wednesday he has a job interview and Friday a job interview somewhere else in the middle of the country because he wants to become a professor and right now he\u2019s a glorified post-doc, almost professor. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201A11\">And so he\u2019s hoping these two universities will offer him a deal and then bring it back to the dean of his school and then say, look \u2013 I got these offers to make me a professor.\u2019 And I asked him, \u2018well, what if they say no. Would you go to there?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll end up. It\u2019s pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201A12\">open.
