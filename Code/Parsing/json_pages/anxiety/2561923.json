All of my spring stuff is in a different\u2026 all my stuff is in my winter jackets and scarves, and so I had to rearrange where all my cards were and find my keys, which were in my racquetball bag. I don\u2019t know. And I was doing really well. It was just the packing up and leaving. And that was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">what\u2026 so I\u2019m really sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I appreciate your apology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I know it\u2019s something you\u2019re working on. It\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really the packing up the night before, and I think I don\u2019t do that. And I think I need to, especially when it\u2019s going from a wintry cold, frosty day\u2026 and I mean I don\u2019t even know\u2026 when I get up and eat and then start working, I don\u2019t even know where my keys are. And so I don\u2019t have any <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">system and I need to. I\u2019m really sorry. And I\u2019m\u2026 next week I\u2019ll try and do better. [1:03] But so well I think a few positive things is that I am\u2026 I had to go in at some time every day, pretty much every day, last week except for Wednesday, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: How did those go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It went okay. I mean a lot of it was for science events, and I got frustrated because there was two science events and a birthday party. Well it was\u2026 on Thursday it was a birthday party, and actually I liked that but I get frustrated with the science because I\u2019ve kind of been the sub co-chair <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">for a few years, and I\u2019m still responsible for getting all the supplies and going to the events, and I\u2019d rather just instead of partying for two hours get to my office and work. And\u2026 but yeah, for the most part it was sort of social interaction that I didn\u2019t exactly want, but it went well. [2:23] And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">I made a deal with my friend because my friend Anna is having a hard time coming in as well. And she lives about a ten minute walk from the department. And she\u2019s like sometimes I shower, which is the ultimate barrier. And since I realized I was at home it was on that really windy Wednesday and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">realized that it may be good if we met on Wednesday morning so that would bring us both into the department and we would have the reliability\u2026 accountability of each other. If I didn\u2019t show up that would be just kind of rude. So I mean I\u2019m going to see how that goes. But I think hearing\u2026 it was interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">hearing\u2026 telling her about these because I think I\u2019ve been at least\u2026 to get into the office at some time, usually it\u2019s like 1:00, 2:00, maybe 3:00, so I feel\u2026 I\u2019m feeling like it\u2019s going better. And the cats actually now expect me to leave at a certain time because they\u2019ll just go to sleep, which was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200195\">part of\u2026 I was looking for my pants today and my cat was sleeping in the drawer. I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to wake him up so I just looked for another pair of pants. [3:47] But and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: When you went in last week did you set a goal of what time you expected yourself to be at the office, or was it\u2026 the goal just to make sure that you got there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I think the goal was just to get there, at this point, and I think I\u2019m working on trying to wake up earlier. And it\u2019s so hard because I wake up at 9:00\u2026 I set the alarm for 9:30 and then I sleep until 10:30, 10:45. And at that point it\u2019s hard to get in early because it\u2019s just basically eat breakfast <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">and\u2026 so I think that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s\u2026 waking up\u2026 and some of that goes along with why am I staying up late.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561923\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Right, that\u2019s a cycle. You stay up really late, it\u2019s hard to get up earlier and start the day earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean last night I stayed up until\u2026 I mean I stayed up until 2:00 and I wasn\u2019t sure why I was\u2026 I mean I guess I was looking at clothes, and I realized that right now there\u2019s just barely enough money to pay for my taxes. And I\u2019m like well I have credit. Surely I can order a dress. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">[5:02] It\u2019s my birthday month. Normally I always do this but I guess because things are\u2026 I mean after putting something in my basket and using all the promo codes and secret gift card, I realized it was still $120. That doesn\u2019t sound like much but I need to order invitations for the wedding, and I realized <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">that even though I really\u2026 there\u2019s all these promos and these things that are telling me that oh, the dress would be so much affordable. It\u2019s $40 off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Sure, it would be cheaper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: But there\u2019s other things I need to buy. And if I do spend money it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019d rather spend it on something that I more or less need rather than I just want, like racquetball classes. So but and in terms of tutoring I feel really good. I\u2019m\u2026 I have a small knowledge of\u2026 I mean I taught the course <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">that I\u2019m tutoring right now a while ago, and I took it a while ago, and so I mean I guess last time I taught it I wasn\u2019t very good at teaching it, or maybe I made mistakes, but now I\u2019m following up with a note that\u2026 I sort of remember the, I don\u2019t know, for some reason the electricity magnetism was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">what stumped me as a\u2026 throughout the progression of my education, and it still\u2026 it\u2019s not my favorite subject but I am doing very well. I feel like I\u2019m really helping the students because they\u2019re not getting a lot of examples in class. [6:53] And so it was really\u2026 it\u2019s really a positive thing. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">mean a while ago my friends had asked why aren\u2019t you just charging them? Why are you going through this organization at Harvard? And I mean part of it is\u2026 is that I\u2019m doing it so that I actually get to the department. After an hour and a half, two hours of\u2026 or three hours a week, it\u2019s\u2026 getting $14 an <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">hour is not bad. I mean sometimes I grumble about that it should be more because I\u2019ve made more in tutoring, but it almost feels like robbery when you\u2019re like oh, that\u2019s $30 and people are pulling out their cash and\u2026 because cash is easier to put underneath the table of how much\u2026 whether you\u2019re earning <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200255\">it or not. But\u2026 and I hadn\u2019t weighed myself in a while and so I weighed myself. I\u2019m a little bit heavier than I would like to be within my buffer zone, and I guess that\u2019s sort of\u2026 I mean it happens every winter for me, where I get a little heavy, and then all of a sudden the weather gets nice and\u2026 but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200256\">I guess I\u2019m just sort of like\u2026 I would say kind of freaking out in a sense. [8:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: How intense is kind of freaking out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Well just sort of like bedreading. It\u2019s not so much\u2026 I mean it\u2019s just sort of like I see all the snacks and the nibbles that I enjoy, and that add so much color, and all the snacking I do, and I\u2019m just sort of really sad because I know that has to stop if I want to maintain. And part of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">reason why I\u2019m gaining weight is because those nibbles are\u2026 I\u2019ll just nibble freely without even\u2026 sort of put my hand in the homemade granola and just start eating because it\u2019s kind of what I do when I\u2019m brain dead or\u2026 so I realize that to sort of\u2026 I\u2019m using food as an outlet for not thinking or for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">just pure excitement, and I see that it\u2019s also sort of stopping because I\u2019m thinking about the sugar or the tasty, because I\u2019m focusing so much on the tasty and the taming the tasty or the\u2026 it\u2019s like a food high. It\u2019s almost kind of like an\u2026 not an addiction but if I think about a salad with kale and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">sweet potatoes and chick peas, oh that\u2019s nice. But if I think about Cinnamon Toast Crunch I just think about more\u2026 and I mean I guess that\u2019s part of why maybe America is fat, is because food is so tasty and sugar\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561923\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You are not fat. [9:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: I know. I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I mean it\u2026 it\u2019s important that you kind of recognize you may be on a higher end of what you consider acceptable for you, but your range of what you feel is acceptable is pretty limited, and pretty thin. So I think before you start really monitoring and decreasing what you\u2019re taking in, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">think it\u2019s also important to use your hunger cues. If you\u2019re snacking because you\u2019re hungry, it\u2019s okay. Because that\u2019s your body telling you that you actually\u2026 you need some sustenance, you need some food, you need to eat in order to have energy, to be able to focus. And it doesn\u2019t seem that you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">gained so much weight that it\u2019s really an indication that you\u2019re overeating. You may be eating in a less controlled way but it\u2019s still\u2026 I can tell from looking at you that you\u2019re certainly not overeating to the point where you\u2019re unhealthy. So while the scale may have gone up that might still be okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">And check in with your body. Check in and see how hungry you are. Food\u2019s supposed to be tasty. You\u2019re supposed to enjoy it. That\u2019s part of eating. That\u2019s one of life\u2019s pleasures. It doesn\u2019t have to be something you deny yourself. So let\u2019s go by your hunger cues as to what\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that\u2019s something that I need to be\u2026 I mean I started becoming\u2026 actually, after March meeting, when I was\u2026 just came back, I was exhausted. And I broke out quite a bit, my skin was dry, I\u2019m like okay, well maybe I need to start taking care of my body a little bit more, making <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">sure at least I get some sleep and drinking some water. [11:50] Because sometimes I\u2019ll be really thirsty and I\u2019ll just keep on drinking coffee, and that\u2019s [inaudible] so I mean I think I\u2019m just trying to\u2026 and even taking care of my skin, and if it\u2019s dry or\u2026 I mean that\u2019s one thing I think that I\u2019m now <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">working on, is how to not\u2026 how to keep up a routine that creates sort of a\u2026 sort of a maintenance rather than sort\u2026 a do nothing and then freak out, and then actually hurt the face by putting lots of very, very harsh chemicals one after the other. And as opposed to doing, say, maybe a lead mask once <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200313\">a week. And I know I\u2019ve been doing that with Jeremy and he likes to wear his war paint, and it\u2019s actually something positive because then he\u2019s sort of\u2026 I feel like we\u2019re being\u2026 rather than having\u2026 looking for support for Jeremy and\u2026 vocally [ph?] I think him doing a mud mask with me is really supportive <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200314\">because then we walk around and pretend that we\u2019re Native Americans and so it turns it into something\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561923\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019re doing something together. [13:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Playing together is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think we recently\u2026 like last night\u2026 well I had ordered this card because I know Jeremy\u2019s very stressed out, and he\u2019s actually doing a better job of expressing how much he appreciates me. And sometimes it\u2019s like okay, okay, that\u2019s enough. But in the one sense it\u2019s definitely\u2026 I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">more romantic towards him, that he expresses this rather than he\u2019s\u2026 I feel much more in sync with him. And I realize that it happens every winter, where we\u2019re just sort of\u2026 he gets very grumpy because the weather\u2019s bad and that we can\u2019t do stuff. But actually I\u2026 because I mean that premarital counseling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">that we did earlier when he said that I was a slug on the weekends and that we don\u2019t go for walks, and I sort of realized okay, well maybe we should go for a walk. And so even though on Sunday was a torrential downpour, we went for it. We went for a three mile walk. And I was going to\u2026 he was like I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200393\">got to hand it to you, I mean I sucked it up because I just sort of I thought well, I mean it\u2019ll be good to get the fresh air and I didn\u2019t do yoga, I didn\u2019t play racquetball, I just\u2026 we\u2019d been inside all day. So I mean I\u2019m trying hard to take care of him and also realize that it\u2019s good for me, ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200394\">that I wouldn\u2019t be sacrificing my own needs but in a sense sort of supplementing my life and taking care of him. And I got him a\u2026 because he\u2019s been very stressed out I got him a wood\u2026 it\u2019s a wood card that says I love you a whole latte, and I put it by his espresso machine and he was very, very, happy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200395\">[14:57] And it reminds me of back in the day when\u2026 I mean it was before we moved in and I started to really focus back on school again. I would devote so much time and energy of bringing him little gifts, and it sort of disappeared and disappeared more and more. And then I realized that maybe it\u2019s good <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200396\">to start bringing back some of the things because it makes me feel happy when I make people happy. And it\u2019s just something\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And then he shows his appreciation, which feels good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I sort of\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t know, I mean I guess I\u2019m\u2026 maybe this winter\u2019s\u2026 the worst of winter\u2019s starting to go away. Now maybe it\u2019s spring I\u2019ll feel a lot more energy. I personally\u2026 I mean I personally feel like I\u2019m able to do stuff, I have energy to do stuff, or drive, more of a drive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">Not necessarily a focus; that\u2019s one thing that I need to work on. I actually wrote the list because I didn\u2019t remember\u2026 for\u2026 so maybe I\u2019ll put out that list, a list of sort of priorities. What are the goals that I\u2019m planning on for the next five years and what are the priorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Wow, that\u2019s a long time frame. I don\u2019t think I gave a time frame.

That\u2019s good. It probably would\u2019ve been a useful thing to do. So share with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Okay, goals. What I\u2019m trying to achieve, or things that I\u2019d like to achieve the next year, five years, I\u2019d like to write papers. Right now I\u2019m trying to write a paper and it sucks and it\u2019s hard, but I hope to get enough experience that I can write papers and build up a sort of a repertoire of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">what I\u2019ve been writing. I\u2019d like to finish my PhD and find a job. I keep on talking about this and\u2026 but I think I\u2019ll feel a lot\u2026 I\u2019ll feel really good about myself once I complete this chapter of my life and move on to something big. Plus, start earning an income. Maintain my relationship with Jeremy <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">and close friends. And this is one thing that I mentioned earlier, that I was really focused in my\u2026 on my relationship with Jeremy and courting him and bussing over to his place. And that sort of kind of slowly started to diminish in these last few years. But now I sort of feel that to start creating <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200453\">a life together, and that\u2019s something that I want to keep up no matter whatever my job is, I mean I don\u2019t know what it is, but I know that there\u2019s certain jobs that would jeopardize that, such as being a consultant. And I guess it wouldn\u2019t jeopardize it but it would make it more difficult to be as close. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200454\">[18:00] And also, I\u2019ve been spending time with my friends and I think\u2026 I mean that\u2019s such a positive thing that I want to make sure that that doesn\u2019t disappear as well. So having a support network is something that I\u2026 is really important to me, and then keeping up with ballet, health, and appearance. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200455\">That\u2019s one thing that\u2026 oh, for a while I\u2019ve been trying out yoga, and yoga was good but now I\u2019m starting to\u2026 I realize that when I take the more difficult classes of ballet, I mean they\u2019re more challenging. And maybe I\u2019m not\u2026 don\u2019t feel as confident, but in the same sense I enjoy the dancing aspect <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200456\">of them. And I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to grow with my life, and how to maintain keeping that artistic side because I think it\u2026 I think a lot of maybe the reasons why I like to bake or cook, and maybe unnecessarily after I\u2019ve cooked like five, six desserts, is because I have this creative <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200457\">energy. And that\u2019s\u2026 a lot of times I sacrifice, oh I\u2019m tired or oh, I don\u2019t feel like going to racquetball. And I sort of feel that putting those aside, I just sort of feel kind of pedestrian. I like that sort of color to my life, and I think maybe that\u2019s sort of the color that\u2026 and sort of what are <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200458\">my priorities in order to accomplish those? Well I have to research in order to write papers and finish my PhD, looking for jobs and applying for jobs, as well as preparing for them. And yesterday I felt really guilty because I spent an hour looking at jobs and looking through them and I was like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200459\">should be researching. I just spent an hour doing nothing, and then I sort of realized well, that\u2019s sort of part of the looking for jobs aspect. [20:07] And it\u2019s hard because I realize that nothing\u2019s really going to be a perfect fit except for a post doc because post docs are a little\u2026 I mean even the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004510\">finding the right post doc wouldn\u2019t be exact carbon copy, but I guess I just have to realize that finding a job\u2026 and in find something looking for it. I mean it\u2019s a difficult process for everyone. And it\u2019s just going to take time. Spending time with Jeremy. I didn\u2019t put and the cats, but I guess that\u2019s\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004511\">I already spend a lot of time with the cats. And so I think that\u2019s a big priority because a lot of times I would just be happy researching in my office all night, which is kind of weird. I mean I\u2019d probably get a little lonely if I kept on doing that but there\u2019s been a few\u2026 there was a night last Monday <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004512\">I just worked until 9 p.m. in my office, or 9:30, and I\u2026 the only reason why I went home is because I didn\u2019t want to get robbed on the way back. But yeah, I sort of realized that trying to make an effort will help me stay close to Jeremy. And I enjoy Jeremy. It\u2019s a delight of my life. And yeah, there <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004513\">are times I get frustrated because I feel I have to sacrifice my job, my job possibilities for Jeremy, but then I sort of realize that it\u2019s something that I chose. I didn\u2019t have to choose to get in a relationship but it\u2019s been something that has really helped [inaudible] helped me come out of my anxiety, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004514\">get my life more on track, get support. [22:07] And so I think it\u2019s sort of one of those things that you\u2019re always sort of\u2026 you don\u2019t appreciate things when life is going good but then when you realize it\u2026 if it were just to disappear, life would be pretty sad and lonely. And so I realize that is a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004515\">huge\u2026 that\u2019s a priority, and whether that means spending more times on the weekends and that\u2019s what I\u2019m really trying to do, is incorporate time on the weekends where we\u2019re together, doing chores, going for a walk. And yeah, we\u2026 I was going to say, we\u2026 this Saturday we celebrated his mom\u2019s 60th <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004516\">birthday, and it was a big birthday party but him and I, the whole day his mom was calling and sort of freaking out. And I was with him the whole day trying to calm him down and give him strategies for maintaining stress and maintaining his relationship with his mom, and I just sort of felt like throughout <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004517\">the whole day I was helping him cook, helping him set up, helping him set up for the party. I mean normally I do that but I think it was sort of\u2026 I don\u2019t know why this goes with spending time with Jeremy but I guess it is because\u2026 I mean I\u2019m just always trying to be very supportive and in the presence <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004518\">and trying\u2026 even though most of the time I don\u2019t feel very warm and fuzzy because I\u2019m thinking about research or thinking about obsessing about something, I\u2019m trying to be warm and share that with him. And for other priorities, attend ballet three times a week at least and at this point I haven\u2019t been <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004519\">doing that. [24:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561923\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20047\">THERAPIST: Is that possible with also making sure that you spend time with Jeremy and spend time researching jobs and doing your current research? Because those were the other things I heard you [inaudible] so I just want to make sure you\u2019re practically\u2026 can you get to ballet three times a week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I definitely can, and especially on the weekends because Jeremy doesn\u2019t like me to work on the weekends. So being able to go to ballet while he exercises is definitely something. And then if I can go twice\u2026 going twice during the week I feel good because it\u2019s only an hour and a half to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200491\">two hours\u2019 commitment, and on the weekends it\u2019s something. Get going on the weekends, going to bed early, waking up and having that time where he can go to the gym and me not just take a nap at home or do nothing, or go [inaudible]. So I guess that is sort of unplugging from the computer, and I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200492\">that\u2019s what I\u2019m\u2026 I have a hard time doing. And even today, getting ready, like at 12:00 at the Cinderella clock, and I had a hard time disconnecting, whether it was my research, whether it was a search that I was doing, I have a hard time disconnecting. And I mean it might just be because I\u2019m on my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200493\">laptop all day and there\u2019s so much\u2026 like I\u2019m always researching something, whether it\u2019s\u2026 I mean I\u2019m\u2026 I should be doing always my research research but I mean even face products, face masks, and cross comparing them. And I sort of realize that\u2026 realizing many [ph?] I mean part of the reason why I do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200494\">it\u2019s because it just feels so natural just being on the computer all day. [26:02] It\u2019s really kind of like a protective shell that I\u2019m\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561923\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You have the screen in front of you blocking the world. So getting in the habit of shutting down your computer, whether it be for two hours to go get out and do ballet, or to really spend some time with Jeremy on the weekend, or be done a little bit earlier in the night, getting into the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004B1\">habit of doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that\u2019s\u2026 I mean and the last time\u2026 I mean I subscribe to a few magazines, and rather than reading them at breakfast on the weekend, I\u2019ll open up my laptop and sort of see what\u2019s going on there. And I think that\u2019s\u2026 I sort of see what sort of hindrance\u2026 and it\u2019s still... my priority\u2019s, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D1\">A, it\u2019s having a hard time sort of leaving one step to the other, and I think part of that is involves the computer, and leaving a program. There\u2019s times at racquetball I won\u2019t [ph?] end up holding my computer open and have it run a program. And I\u2019m oh, I mean there\u2019s probably more savvy ways of doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D2\">this on a cluster but last time I worked on a cluster I sort of hammed up the system and they were about to kick me off, so I realized that maybe that\u2019s not a good idea. But I mean I don\u2019t even shut down my computer. I don\u2019t research it. I don\u2019t reboot it. It just keeps on running because there\u2019s\u2026 so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D3\">much of my life is in those screens, and I have a hard time of just letting go and saying okay, it\u2019s time to go back to the computer later. I think\u2026 I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Can those things be saved and shut down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah but then I\u2019ll have to reopen them. And I think that\u2019s the resetting of my mind. It doesn\u2019t do so well. I have a hard time just sort of rebooting my own mind because in a sense I am scattered, and maybe I need to start writing notes of what my thought was before I left. [28:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20053\">THERAPIST: That might be helpful. And in the same way that the night before, deciding where you\u2019re going to go and getting your bag set up, work wise the parallel is looking at where you are when you\u2019re stopping for the night, gathering your thoughts and determining where you\u2019re going to start the next <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200531\">day. It\u2019s that same kind of practice of having a way of closing one part of the\u2026 closing one day or closing one activity and preparing yourself for the next one. If you write a note as to here\u2019s where I was, this is what I was thinking about, this is where I\u2019m going to start tomorrow, it won\u2019t be so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200532\">scary to really shut it down and give it a break. Let yourself transition to the next part of your life, which might be sleeping and relaxing or having dinner where you\u2019re really present with your boyfriend, fianc\u00e9.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20055\">CLIENT: Man, whatever it is, partner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20057\">THERAPIST: That random guy you live with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20059\">CLIENT: And not my [inaudible] Yeah, I think that\u2019s something I really need to get in the habit of doing because I think that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s really\u2026 I get\u2026 I sort of see it\u2019s a real\u2026 by not having\u2026 I have the set tasks in my head, but by not writing them down I start to look at\u2026 I forget even what I\u2019m doing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200591\">And I mean part of the way I used to work is just do a bunch of things and then suddenly [inaudible] this has happened. But I sort of see that if it\u2019s just unstructured, sort of gathering of data, just\u2026 and even with my life\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561923\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It might not work on the time frame that you want it to work on. [30:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, the [inaudible] is normal. And that\u2019s why I look at clothes, is because that\u2019s when my brain would take a break and synthesis would happen. But I sort of realize that in a sense it\u2019s wasting time because I start focusing more on the clothes or more on the face product or\u2026 and I think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2005D1\">really being able to take a breath and say okay, it\u2019s\u2026 I mean there\u2019s [inaudible] 11:55, why\u2026 I had to look up a few more things, why I waited until 12:05. And that could\u2019ve been ten minutes that I was here earlier. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with getting here early, and it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s the why am I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2005D2\">pushing it, why\u2026 a lot of it is that it\u2019s hard to let go of the flow of\u2026 it\u2019s, yeah, I just need to be able to\u2026 and maybe there\u2019s a lot of ways I can practice this is [inaudible] what time I have to get ready, it has to happen, and that takes so much self-control but I think that\u2019s\u2026 and how come normal <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2005D3\">people don\u2019t have problems with it. I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2005F\">THERAPIST: People struggle with different things. [31:27] So I think maybe the next step with this is keep that list. I want you to distill it down to headings. So racquetball, investing in relationships, completing research papers, and looking for a job. I think I got\u2026 am I missing one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20061\">CLIENT: No, no, I think that\u2019s good. (pause) And then what you can do, create\u2026 and you can use your creativity here to make it inviting for yourself. On a regular piece of paper create something with those main sections, however it makes sense to you, so that when you look at it you can sit there at <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200611\">the end of the day, or the beginning of the day, and say okay, how am I going to hit these four main places in this day. And the goal is to go to racquetball three times a week so there will be lots of days when sort of honoring the creative part of yourself that is expressed through racquetball doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200612\">mean you necessarily go to racquetball class that day. But maybe it\u2019s just thinking to yourself, yeah, I\u2019m an athlete, and I\u2019m going to go to this class tomorrow. But it might just be a moment of recognizing that yeah, that\u2019s part of my identity. [33:04] It\u2019s one of my priorities, is committing to that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200613\">And it doesn\u2019t mean that it gets an hour or a class or anything other than that acknowledgment. That might be it. But then [inaudible] look and say okay, how am I going to honor the priority of looking for a job today. Is that doing a search? Is it submitting an application? So you can sit there, have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200614\">a piece of paper on your computer, and maybe when you open up your laptop it\u2019s there so you have a moment to sit down and kind of get grounded and say okay, here\u2019s these four main things, how\u2019s my day going to honor each one. And hopefully that will help you kind of set an intention for how you do the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200615\">day. So it doesn\u2019t feel unstructured or haphazard or passive, that it just kind of happens. You can set the intention to hit those four things with some acknowledgement and some of them\u2026 some substantial time each day. And let\u2019s see how that impacts how you can go about each day and how the weeks take <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200616\">shape. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561923\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, that really makes sense. I think it reminds me of my dad said when he was in college he would make structured lists of how he was going to spend his time. And so now I sort of see that maybe other people have difficulty in\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean people\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 lives get complicated and complex and busy, and you\u2019re\u2026 and I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s happened, is that your responsibilities have gotten bigger and in more places. [34:43] So it\u2019s harder to manage them all. And I don\u2019t know, you might be a list person. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200651\">have this creative side, maybe we can tap into that to make\u2026 to have it resonate for you. And find a way to organize it in a way that really fits your personality and is pleasing to you. Looking at a long list of things you have to do can be really offputting, but if you can create some sort of visual <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200652\">that feels creative it won\u2019t\u2026 maybe it won\u2019t be offputting. Maybe it\u2019ll actually be inviting to see that and find a way to use it. Why don\u2019t we stop there for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20067\">CLIENT: And I think we\u2019re on for next week. [inaudible] And it\u2019s in my calendar.
