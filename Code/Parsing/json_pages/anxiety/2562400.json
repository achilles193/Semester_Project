On the way over I had this, what, this week, next week? And I\u2019m glad that it was next week. So here\u2019s the (inaudible at ) we discussed. I feel breathy, and have felt frustrated with my office mentor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the best way to put it. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So Monday there was like a sort of, they sort of, it was a meeting of mentors, mentees, and people in another program, that\u2019s some (inaudible at ). And you know, it was like networking to your advantage, I don\u2019t know, something. So it was, so it was like a little four-person breakout group with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">my mentor Laney, and then two other people, one of whom would not, like, was very narrow to what she had to say, which was frustrating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So it was like, Laney doesn\u2019t really talk, like doesn\u2019t really small talk. In the group, she didn\u2019t really talk very much. And because I was feeling frustrated, there was a question like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest barrier to,\u201d it was like, \u201cnot working, or to getting success?\u201d And I was just like, \u201cInstitutionalized <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">oppression.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Oppression, is that what you said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes, I said institutionalized and structural oppression. And so the leader was like talking about like power dynamics of like who is in the room with [], and she was like, \u201cI really think that table should be somewhere else.\u201d And at first you just kind of go hmm, and then you think, \u201cOh, you\u2019re, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">hmm, yeah, you\u2019re the president. I\u2019ll just move that table.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYes.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">And then I just sort of followed up, I\u2019m like, \u201cBut also.\u201d And I don\u2019t know, my mentor seemed a little, like seemed a little either off-put or surprised, I\u2019m not really sure which, which is like again, I think, like it\u2019s just, it\u2019s very weird. You never know what she\u2019s thinking. So when I was done, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">I talked to a few people because we were supposed to, and then went back to work. And pretty quickly got a phone call from her which was super awkward, which was just like, first she just said, \u201cOh, I missed you, so I wanted to say, \u2018Have a good day.\u2019\u201c Then there was a pause, and I\u2019m like, \u201cThank you.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I sort of babbled something, and (inaudible at \u2018), and then she said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d And I thanked her, and got off the phone. And I feel like I don\u2019t know what just happened, like okay, like why did that just happen? I don\u2019t know. It was just, A, the conversation felt very weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">and stilted, and like it was something she was supposed to do or someone told her to do, because it really wasn\u2019t a conversation, or it was one where I was feeling it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And she seemed surprised, and she had left work. When I talk about homophobia being experienced at Cambridge, people are always surprised, and so I mentioned that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Homophobia or the part of she being surprised?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I mentioned homophobia at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And whenever I bring that at work, people are like, \u201cAt Cambridge?\u201d And then one person took that point in time to talk a lot about how that never happens in her department. Which is Women in Gender Studies, but still I suspect that\u2019s not entirely true. So I kind of feel like I\u2019m sort of stuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">again at this, well, what I actually wanted a mentor for was not. Actually, what I wanted a mentor for was to help me deal with like racism and sexism in the workplace. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562400\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">Also racism, or whatever, and to get some kind of like, you know, \u201cYes, that sucks, maybe here are some suggestions,\u201d or just \u201cThat sucks,\u201d which I haven\u2019t gotten from her. And she hasn\u2019t seemed interested in that topic. So I stopped, so I said, \u201cHmm,\u201d and now kind of like well, do you like, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">I could tell you all about that, but I\u2019m not sure where we would go with that. Like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Tell her\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I could tell her like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Ways of talking to her about it and the (inaudible at ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sort of like, part of me wants to say like, \u201cLook, what I wanted out of a mentor was this, and while you are a very nice helpful person, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re giving me.\u201d And the other part of me is kind of like, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t talk about that because you seemed completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">uninterested, but I just\u2014\u201d I feel very frustrated and I feel like so tired out that I just don\u2019t really\u2014The program\u2019s almost over, so there\u2019s no point in like dropping out of it, whatever that would mean. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">But I\u2019m just really exhausted and don\u2019t feel like it any more, as best I can put it. Like yeah, I basically just don\u2019t feel like it. And so I had a hard time like completing the mentorship goals I set for myself for a variety of reasons. Probably the biggest would be being depressed and frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Both for the mentorship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: So I had three goals, which I didn\u2019t think were too bad. One was putting up the sign about where the disabled bathrooms are, which is still in progress, or rather, I wrote the sign, and just had a meeting today about how we still can\u2019t put that sign up, nor can we really deal with until after <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">commencement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Like until June, but they\u2019re going to send someone to take some measurements and see if there actually are problems, and the regular things, and then also someone in the meeting criticized me for language I was explicitly told I had to use, which was \u201cBathrooms with accessible features.\u201d So this person <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">was like, \u201cWhat does accessible features mean?\u201d I don\u2019t know. The office told me to say that. Like help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">And coincidentally, when I was leaving today I ran into a woman in the ladies room that has accessible features who was, there are double doors, there are two sets of doors that you have to try to get through to get in and out of the bathroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: And they\u2019re just far apart that you can\u2019t like, in a wheelchair, reach back or forward, if you had that much mobility to hold one open, and so you, they\u2019re really hard to get out. Like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I helped her get through both of them and then I asked her about it a little bit. And like one of my friends asked if there was like, you know, in a friendship sort of as comedy, I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, yes I am.\u201d I don\u2019t know what to tell. I\u2019m sort of like, you know, still working on it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And when we have these meetings, I guess it\u2019s like a meeting, like I still in the end do not understand why like we can\u2019t put it, like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562400\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: You have to put a sign up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, like\u2019s that sort of like the end result of each meeting. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, but can I just put a sign up?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Just something? Anything? You know, just because there will be special like historical issues and how we should measure everything and do you\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Wait, measure what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Like measure the door width, the stall width, (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Like the bathrooms have accessible features? Or it does?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yes. And how successful are those features?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m just like, \u201cBut could we maybe just say we could try?\u201d Like and then today was also well. I mean, we need to plan because if we put descriptive language in for your office, we have to plan to do it for everyone, for all the other offices. I\u2019m just like, \u201cPut, can we just let them pee?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">Like I just kept getting really stuck at the why just, like I don\u2019t know why we need to have an hour meeting to not, race to the second hour-long meeting if I\u2019m not being (inaudible at ). The other people\u2019s, one was to write up some documentation on captioning and the other was to offer a class on Photoshop. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">In feeling so, I\u2019ve been feeling so frustrated, I\u2019m to the point where I thought it would be easiest just putting up a sign, I\u2019m just, it\u2019s really hard to do anything. And also, like it just, like I don\u2019t know. Because so many things are frustrating, I just keep on procrastinating, like I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">it\u2019s, when someone says something critical at work about me at work, which happens regularly, it\u2019s really, really hard for me to, like that kind of kills the work for the day in a way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">Like, or rather like if someone like criticizes a project I\u2019m working on or there\u2019s like, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing forty more things?\u201d It\u2019s very hard for me to then sit down and do like, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s,\u201d so I feel like, so I\u2019ll make this Photoshop tutorial and then people will criticize it and I\u2019ll get negative <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">feedback or I won\u2019t be allowed to do it for new reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Same with the couch thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Or you\u2019ll do it and it will get, you\u2019ll get positive feedback, and then somehow you won\u2019t be able to do anything with it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like it\u2019s honestly hard for me to think of not getting some kind of negative feedback or complaints. I guess complaints. Like that\u2019s, yeah, I just can\u2019t think of how I won\u2019t at someone complaining, someone insisting that I\u2019m the techie, therefore I can do it and they can\u2019t because they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">not a techie, they\u2019re a employee. And yeah, all I can think of is people saying well, like I can\u2019t do it because I\u2019m not a techie and not being willing to do like listen to whatever it is I\u2019m presenting, or do the basic like, can you read these ten steps? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">And yeah, like I just can\u2019t really think of it, I guess it\u2019s just hard for me to think of it being a positive anything. And I guess I haven\u2019t finished my, I have another set of overlapping goals that with Chet, that I haven\u2019t really progressed on since we had a, you know, crappy fight in the middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">of the office. But then again, he hasn\u2019t brought them up again since, so I\u2019m just\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I feel sort of half abandoned and half micro-managed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562400\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: yeah.

Like I don\u2019t feel like, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">feel like anything\u2019s going to really come from doing like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">With the time and the effort and the whatever is not going to get me anything. I mean, among other things, it\u2019s definitely not going to get me out of my cube, I\u2019m not going to be like early in the week someone was in the media lab (inaudible at ), just talking really loudly for about an hour, like doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">Skype or something. And I had this horrible headache, and like just couldn\u2019t beat it and ended up just going home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">Because I felt like crap, and part of it, and also what part of it was so horrible and stressful was that I couldn\u2019t shut the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it just seems so like oh. I feel so infantalizing and ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: And the other thing is I think as I\u2019m sitting in the office doing whatever and the student workers who are supposed to help people who are using, learn how to use like Filecut (sp?) or Photoshop or whatever, and Chet and Karl are like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to,\u201d they have this vision currently <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">of like redoing part of the office and having it be staffed entirely by students who, you know, because they\u2019re students, just know instinctively how to use these programs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">And I just am like, \u201cOkay, but you know, like right now people come to the lab and ask for help. They get shrugs a lot.\u201d I don\u2019t see how a whole floor of that is going to be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Right. Also comes to me that as though they put quite a lot more faith in the student workers to be sort of helpful and to kind of run things themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Than you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: You need to be in an office where you\u2019re sitting right across from Chet. You can\u2019t close the door. You can\u2019t like create any sort of private space for yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">You feel micro-managed. You know, we just throw a bunch of students, you know, down there some place and they\u2019ll magically both know how to do what anyone asks them to do and how to explain it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: And we won\u2019t need to keep an eye on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s very true. I mean, it\u2019s also like I feel like the expectations on student workers, or especially how much technology or software or whatever that they know, and that they could explain, is crazy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">I think, I mean in part because I guess we\u2019re being cheap, but I don\u2019t know, like a lot of, like some of the people saying this have never touched those programs, and I\u2019m kind of like, \u201cDo you know how complicated that crap is?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Like it\u2019s really difficult. There\u2019s all these weird fiddly things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562400\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: So they think they\u2019re just saying, \u201cOh, that person can basically use Microsoft Word.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Oh, they\u2019re just (inaudible at ) paper, they can use Microsoft Word. Oh, they\u2019re young, so they can probably use (inaudible at ) Pro, or Photoshop or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, they just know how to use it. They just you know, walked out and know how to use it. And my other thought was yes, they can sit down and bash their way through, but it\u2019s not really pleasant or efficient or effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: You know, like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Or what you want and somebody teaching somebody else, I would think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, like forcing your way through is not fun. And so I went to a reference services staffing to talk to them about Photoshop. And<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: About Photoshop?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yes, about teaching them Photoshop. And images, like people were really kind of (inaudible at ) themselves, but one of the things I realized when I was sitting there, I was like, \u201cOh, this meeting is not the hell\u2019s gate that my staffing,\u201d they just have monthly staff meetings for my department <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">are. Like the other department lets people talk. She, you know, asks a question and lets you answer it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">Crazy things like that, and when I was there, they were going to have, they were doing like a, not a staff leadership, like a building cohesiveness half-day retreat at work followed by a light, you know, beer afterwards. And I was like, \u201cOh, that would be nice to do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: But, and I talked to someone who goes to book meetings, my meetings and breakfast meetings. She\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really different. It\u2019s so horrible, and it\u2019s really hard to describe.\u201d Yes, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Referring to your (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Like that the, our department, the department meetings that like I have are just so horrible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">And I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I think I just, like I just have such a hard time thinking of this changing in any real way. And yeah, I mean <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">It\u2019s hard to think of it changing, and it remains, like I remain getting frustrated when other people are doing things that I know how to do, or whether they\u2019re failing, they\u2019re having a really hard time with it. And I\u2019m like, \u201cI could do that in a minute, or not.\u201d Because I\u2019m not an employee, which, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">when also when I say that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Like the technical things, or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I discovered that the three-employee team that who runs the Tumblr, they don\u2019t know how to use Tumblr, they don\u2019t know how to use Photoshop, they don\u2019t know how to resize images, they don\u2019t understand like any of it, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d So like occasionally when I walk by, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">they\u2019ll be like, \u201cKaren, how do you do this? How do you do this?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">And all I could think of is, \u201cOr, I could do it,\u201d but like what\u2019s the point of me having this information in my head and watching you do it repeatedly when the answer\u2019s no?.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Which also makes me feel very embittered and also slightly crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t make any sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t make any sense. And\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: And I guess yet it seems to everybody else. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to you and yet it seems to to everybody else, like that\u2019s what seems to me to be too crazy making, the ingredients to crazy making.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562400\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Like it\u2019s a combination of like I feel like sometimes I could literally no way for me to use like my knowledge of Photoshop at work, which seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">so crazy. Or like I got really stalled working on Filecut (sp?), because I also don\u2019t think I (inaudible at ) at work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">And I feel like I have no, no advocacy or support and, but then I also think that I don\u2019t know would it even work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: You say what wouldn\u2019t even work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Like if Chet said to the (inaudible at ), like \u201cHey, maybe Karen should be involved in that project that she knows everything about.\u201d It\u2019s unclear to me if that would actually get me involved with projects. Like if, like say if Chet talked to an employee from another group and said, \u201cYou know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED1\">like have you thought of including Karen on this project?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">I don\u2019t feel like that would lead to me being involved in that project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Like because of something from their side?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Or just something would happen and it would fall through?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: I feel like I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re would be something that would require follow-through and sort of no one would take responsibility for it, or Chet would just be like, \u201cWell, I suggested it.\u201d Or I feel like the group would sort of say like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like a (inaudible at ) signs for the bathroom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Like there\u2019s really no apparent credible reason why you shouldn\u2019t just put them up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: But mumble mumble will handle it, somehow it\u2019s not happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Right, like I really couldn\u2019t tell you. Like, you know, I could tell you, but I couldn\u2019t tell you why this hasn\u2019t happened, and that\u2019s how I feel about work, I guess, which yeah. Like, and also there is no, if I don\u2019t fulfill these goals, nothing really happens. I\u2019m just supposed to be motivated <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">to fulfill them, which I\u2019m not feeling motivated any more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: And no one\u2019s really helping me with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: And like I just sort of, like I sort of don\u2019t know what to do, like should I sit down with a manager and say, \u201cLook, all these things suck.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">You know, blah. And I also worry, like I feel, I worry about being perceived as someone who\u2019s really negative, or who always complains, and there is of course no real way to, that\u2019s a hard question to ask someone, though, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a negative person?\u201d But also, I am feeling sort of low on my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">positively-phrased constructive criticism urge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">Like right now, I\u2019m kind of like I either don\u2019t want to talk about it, or like, or telling them like, going for the throat and being like, \u201cLook, these are all the problems. These are.\u201d Like after this meeting about the bathrooms, a big part of me is like, \u201cI wonder if I should just call the (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F1\">at ) disabilities office. I\u2019ll call the Pope. I don\u2019t know, cute. But I don\u2019t think I, like I like having a job.

And then part of me\u2019s like, \u201cNo, where is that going to get me? Nowhere.\u201d And I\u2019m also having a lot of misgivings about talking at this professional conference in May. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">Partially because the class, my office school class professor is going to be there, so I feel a little awkward, because I\u2019ve done horrible in his class this semester. And also, there\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: Can you remind me what the conference presentation is, I think you told me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s about whole person [].

I\u2019m not a professional, so I don\u2019t know how a professional (inaudible at ) is, so meh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: That you don\u2019t have any professional\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: So, yeah, so for me, like I\u2019m giving this talk, but I actually am, don\u2019t have professional development funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s kind of slightly moot, because\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Slightly ironic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and also there\u2019s a presentation, like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: All right. It just seems emblematic of a lot of what you\u2019re describing in that you are trying to contribute, and help people. And are getting nothing for it. And I don\u2019t just mean like that someone should be paying you, or somebody should be like putting up big posters of you in the office, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F1\">but you know, I think it\u2019s a, not even for you. You don\u2019t even want people who could get like support for your professional development, right, the answer is yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like I might just take a vacation day to go to a conference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: Right, just crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know. Like for all that I value having a work personal boundary, because especially being in these meetings about the stupid bathroom signs. I\u2019m kind of like, part of me is like, \u201cWell, I know you think I\u2019m some like shmo, but I actually do know a lot about this topic, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201371\">and I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re sticking your feet in the like, I could just do this. Like I know a lot about this, which is why I\u2019m bringing it up. Can we work together on this?\u201d Or like, \u201cI actually know a lot about diversity training, or I know a lot about feminism, or just whatever, whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562400\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">And I don\u2019t know. I feel like it\u2019s not, we don\u2019t bring up a lot of work because I like having that boundary, but I feel like even if I just sat down and said, \u201cHey guys. Here are the things that are (inaudible at ), or that I\u2019m willing to share with you or whatever,\u201d they\u2019re response would be like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">non-response. Which is also part of the like, like my, you know, calling the disabilities office, includes like, and then I talk to all my disability rights friends, and have them blow up the Internet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">Which would, you know, again, be satisfying in a way, but not a good idea. But it would be really satisfying. And part of me really wants to say to work, like, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not doing that. Like I could set this whole thing on fire, but I\u2019m not, so let\u2019s talk about that.\u201d Like could I ask my colleagues, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B1\">like it sounds weird to say like I would like you to notice I\u2019m not setting this building on fire. But that\u2019s how I feel. And I don\u2019t know. Like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Well I think, and in your mind you\u2019re pretty desperate for some acknowledgement of something about you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah, like that would be awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Especially since like, like theoretically, like in my, like so only Chet, just three people, and in theory, like my job is the lowest of them. And so my lazy, being in troublemaking, coworker Harry\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Who used to (inaudible at )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: Yes. And\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at  it again, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: Using (inaudible at ), like he, I don\u2019t know. Like weirdly is in some way above me in like the department. And I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">It just, it so, it feels in some ways more, I don\u2019t think accumulating\u2019s quite right, but sort of. Like one of the secretary (inaudible at ) were shitty at me for being the secretary, but they\u2019re just like, \u201cYou\u2019re just a secretary.\u201d That sucked. But I was just like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s all I want to do right <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D1\">now, so fuck you, whatever.\u201d And also that\u2019s kind of part of the job, like, but I feel less like it\u2019s part of what my job is, and also I just don\u2019t feel like, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">So when faculty were shitty, they\u2019re faculty, they\u2019re like separate from me. And your coworkers were usually supportive, I mean, whatever. In this case, I feel like my coworkers aren\u2019t supportive, and faculty (inaudible at ), like there\u2019s a sort of like faculty equivalent of important people who just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F1\">do things. But there\u2019s like, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s actually anyone I can just be like, \u201cOh my God, this was so annoying.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: And they\u2019d be like, \u201cOh yeah, I hate my professor too, or it\u2019s so obnoxious. My professor also made me do greeting cards.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Right, like this is all from within your own group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">You know, like when we were, as secretarial staff, I don\u2019t know, like journaling, either stuck up for each other, we\u2019d bitch with each other, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m getting that. I\u2019m not really, I don\u2019t know how to get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: This does all make you pretty miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: It really is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at ), I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s like it\u2019s for me one of the other things is that I\u2019m so miserable that I worry that like I\u2019m not going to get to December, which is so close.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20160-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20160-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562400\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: But I need to like get my degree so I don\u2019t feel like some kind of, like I kind of want to look for a new job, but I don\u2019t want to look for a new job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: Right.
