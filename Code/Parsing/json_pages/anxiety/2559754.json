Don't worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: And I'm away part of next week, but just Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, so it doesn't affect us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: You've been more than understanding about my health issues, so I am... I have no... I am more than willing to reciprocate on any level (laughing). So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It's been sort of a... I don't know what's going on right now. I have both an energy and physical and emotional rollercoaster I've sort of been on, so, just when I think I'm completely and totally exhausted, I'm like, okay, I can do this. It's like... when I get like this, I hate this because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">I'm a very easily reinforced human being. [0:01:01] And so what's going to happen... in the back of my head I'm going to think to myself, well, you know that last time that you just sort of pushed through even though you couldn't do it, and you found the energy to do it, and it wasn't that bad? Yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">(Pause) But... so that's sort of a problem. But I'll make it, I guess. Just did something totally and completely impulsive that I don't normally do. But I have a feeling that if I get myself in trouble I can totally get myself out of it. Like I said, I don't do impulsive spending at all. However, do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">you know what the Nobel Prize is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I do. I think I listened to those on NPR or something a while ago. [0:01:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So there's a small kind of like... I wouldn't really call it a journal. It's all kinds of things that either cannot or should not ever be repeated. And it's run out under Harvard, and it's basically... you would think it was spoofed, but it's almost always real fake research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: She looks like she was reaching for the water or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, are you reaching for the water, or are you just sniffing? There's nothing in there. You want to make sure you're okay? No, I think she's just being weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Nothing on you? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: [She went weird] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That'll make her better though for the walk... ride home. Anyway, so the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: If you need some more water for her or something, I have a whole bunch of water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay. I'll let you know. If she seems like she's really dehydrated I will. But she had a ton of water on the way, so I'm guessing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Well, when someone's five pounds it's really hard to really gauge (chuckling)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckling). [0:02:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Anyway, so the thing they do is supposed to be a... it's supposed to be this journal of things that should never be repeated. It's actually... the people who are the peer review people are people who won real Nobel Prizes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: So it's sort of a running joke. I mean, it is extremely prestigious but yet extremely hanky (sp?). All of the data is complete... it's basically where, if you have something, an experiment that goes horribly wrong, that the data doesn't actually... there's something not right, like imagine table <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">top (ph) fusion or you accidentally found Fermat's Theorem answer, but you found it by using... by doing something completely irrational. And for some reason it looks like it's real, but it's not. You publish it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Well, every year they have something called the Nobel ceremony, where they have as many Nobel Award (inaudible at 0:03:46) they can. And they award the world's worst research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I see. So they give... so that's separate from what they publish in the journal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, separate. This is the best things of the year. [0:04:00] And sometimes they actually don't have the real people who get it, who... for example, the one year that they had this minister calculated how many souls were going to hell if they don't repent now. He won the mathematics award, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">and, since he wasn't around to take it, they actually... for some reason, I guess, this person who... this ambassador from Norway just happened to be in the area, and they invited him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And so he accepted on their behalf, how excited they were about all the recent tourism coming to Norway, that kind of sort of... but it's actually totally prestigious. I've been wanting to go for years and years and years. And usually by the time I realize it's coming up, it's sold out. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">it's extremely expensive, too, because almost all of it is... the money... well, it's (inaudible at 0:04:46) which is in general expensive to do. But they usually have things that they actually do fund with the money from it. [0:04:54] And so some friends of ours were talking about coming up for it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">this year. We always talk about it every year, but this is the year that we all realized that the tickets were actually on sale. Last balcony seats, just over there. So I went, and, before I could even get confirmation that they were going to come, I just bought four tickets. It's unlike me. But I figured <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B3\">that if I can't do it I can scalp them because they're really hard to do, but it's so embarrassing because you have to understand that 15-year-old me had no problem spending $170 on anything. Now I am terrified to spend that much money. And it's weird because that's... there's 20-some-odd-plus years <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B4\">of inflation, and I don't know. So we'll see. Like I said, I'm pretty sure that if things got really bad and they couldn't come up or I couldn't afford to do it then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: [Or actually] (ph) you could scalp them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I got four... the last four balcony seats they had, which aren't expensive tickets, but they're the ones that are more... because they... they're the ones that are more supposedly fun because it's more bad... its more almost bad behaviors MST3K kind of dork sitting up there, yeah. [0:06:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: MST... is that Mystery Science Theater 3000?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: [You don't hear] (ph) that every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. So this is... that's... it's not the prestigious seats, but it's actually dork prestigious seats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: So that's... yeah. So I did that. And I am of course beating myself up over it, but I know I can reclaim it. It's not that big of a deal. But at the same time it's so awkward for me to do anything like that. Like, oh. And the thing is, is that it's not awkward in my usual nature but because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">of (inaudible at 0:06:44). It was hard... it was very weird to do. But the funny thing is... and I'm sort of flattered. [0:06:58] The people at the box office are like, yeah, I know you. You're needing two student tickets. I'm like, I'm just not even going to lie. I'm just not going to argue. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B2\">I could technically consider myself ABD, just ABD on hiatus. But she's like, yeah, I know you're a student. Don't worry. I'm like, really? Okay, I'm just going to lie by omission...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right, (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: And just let... spend a little bit less per ticket. But I don't feel guilty about that part because... but I was flattered because I don't know if I just look like somebody else or if I just look like I belong as a professional graduate student or what. But it was nice, nice to be the, oh, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">belong... have them say, I know exactly who you are, don't bother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: And I could see that in Cincinnati, but Providence's a big town. I doubt this person actually knew who I was, but that I looked young enough to be considered a grad student made me feel good. [0:07:55] So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Nice. Sounds great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, so that's been pretty much this afternoon. But it's been... it's actually probably for the best that you were out sick yesterday... not yesterday, I mean last week, because I came in after child hell. We conduct camp at the store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Kid camp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) last year, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's not... I mean, I actually... I don't... I'm really great with children, and I'm exceptionally great with computers. I am very... I have a lot of difficulty working with kids and computers. Lots of people say I'm good at it. I've seen people who are good at it. I just seem to look <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">like I'm not... I can fake not being uncomfortable around it. But the way the kids grasp certain things is really different than the way adults do. And so pretty much... it's one of those things where... (Pause) [0:08:59] It... I don't have self-doubts about becoming a parent. But for the 30 minutes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">afterwards I kind of do. You know? And so it's kind of a weird situation like that. It's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: How do you doubt yourself? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: People are really good at having these really wonderful sagacious answers to questions or being able to divert situations. And almost always the way I do it is by (pause) saying something along the lines of, I do realize this is what you want. But we can't do that right now. We have to do this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">Or my personal favorite is, if you can just be quiet and listen to what John's saying up there, he's saying exactly the question you're asking. That kind of stuff. I lot of other people are really... they seem to have much snappier, interesting answers, more... not the word entertaining, but more engaging? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">[0:10:08] I don't remember what it was, but one of my... the kids were saying something about how... that this wasn't play, this was work, and blah blah blah. And Carrie (sp?) who of course has kids, she says, no, no, no, you're playing. I'm working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) And just various different things like that. And the kid took it totally okay, while with me, I had to spend time coaxing them into believing that this is fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Or... and I don't know. Like I said, I don't have... only for a very... of course 20 children at that age all together I think makes a lot of people go doubt their ability to deal with kids (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: But yeah, that was an experience. [0:10:58] So it was actually kind of good to be able to drag myself home and go straight to bed after that because that was hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Must take a lot of energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: I feel... now, that's one thing I do feel bad about, because I do feel bad that other people don't seem to be nearly as phased by it as I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: The energy involved, but also they're either one, parents and they're kind of used to at some point doing a play date with a bunch of kids?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) I'm sure it will be the same for you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Or they're 22.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It's a totally different ballgame once you're a parent, I think, with that kind of thing. I mean, you spend thousands of hours dealing with kids...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, you just get used to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: And your kid's friends and the other kids in your kid's class. It's just a different everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. To me it was just so weird, because on some level I could definitely see... and I don't... and it was very hard for me to... at first, because some of the things that seemed really difficult, I started seeing patterns. [0:11:52] The kids that were all siblings seemed to have... if they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">had a really low frustration level, it was all on the same stuff. I can't find the letter H. What the hell? You have to stop the entire thing because you're trying to type, and you... and stop everybody because you can't find the letter H?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Really? That was... it seemed like the kids that got really, I am bored, it was like they were all siblings. So it's... I don't know if it's like a nurture-nature thing in terms of that. But it made it feel... made me feel at least a little bit better because it seemed like they were all together <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">in terms of having...? It wasn't like in general all the kids found it boring or all that. It seemed like it was more of a... so... and I don't know. (inaudible at 0:12:43) it was... I'm sure this is... I will evolve into this and it will become a lot easier, just (laughing)... just once a year. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">I said, though, if we're sitting on the ground doing art projects or doing something outside or something like that, perfectly okay. [0:12:58] It's just... to me it's really hard to properly get them at the right level for computer stuff because they seem to grasp stuff a lot faster. But at the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200973\">time they really don't. It's... they show the kind of behavior that makes you think that they understand it, but they don't really truly understand it? They just are not afraid to experiment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: So it's more like... random behavior looks like intelligence...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Not really intelligence, but you know what I'm trying to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, comprehension or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, so the... (Pause) So that was kind of... like I said, kind of an interesting, bizarre experience. And, like I said, every year it happens. We also have kids come for school field trips, which is usually... it varies a lot, that, but that's different, one, because the parents usually aren't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">there, and because, when the parents are nearby, it seems to really change behavior a lot. [0:13:58] So... in terms of that. But, like I said, it worked out for the best in general. So that was kind of good. But yeah. I don't know. Like I said, I've been feeling really... and part of it is I know now <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A32\">again that it was due to medication deficiency sort of. But I've been really feeling out of myself in terms of not feeling normal a lot?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Fuzzy-headed, feeling like the world is very cloudy, that kind of stuff again. I had an extremely...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Not exactly emotionally but... (Pause) I don't know how you'd say it, like psychologically not right. I mean in the sense of being like, the world is cloudy, your head is fuzzy, (crosstalk)... [0:15:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't feel sad and... I mean, a little bit, but most of the sad... it's not like emotional swings entirely? It's more like noise in the system and can't figure out what I need to pay attention to, kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Like, I had to write a self-evaluation. And usually... not usually, but, if I'm in a room with a bunch of other people and there's some banter going on, this and that, usually it's not the end of the world. I can ride it, sort of. I'll struggle but I can do it. I am unable to focus on writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">a single sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: That kind of stuff. I mean, part of it was the nature of what it was. It wasn't like I was writing down a procedure, but I actually had to talk about my own achievements, which is a little bit different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: So... and we have sort of a running joke that, of course I broke the system because (inaudible at 0:15:54) because there was so much bullshit. But it just takes a lot of time. [0:16:01] It's a lot of time, even for two paragraphs, writing about this kind of stuff because (pause) I... (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">I wanted to make sure that I really capture what I want to say correctly. But at the same time I don't want it to... the problem I have is I second guess this. I have been told by many people that, in their words, I use too big words. It looks like I ran through it with thesaurus and then switched out <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B72\">for the most impressive words. That's just not who I am. I'm actually... I just... and the funny thing is, is that, honestly, I don't use... I use a lot of big words, but they... I really do have... there's a distinct set of 200 bizarre words that nobody else but they're totally (inaudible at 0:16:50) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B73\">from normal vocabulary that I would use that other people wouldn't. [0:16:58] And it's not like I'm looking them up. They're just the words that I use for all kinds of stuff. And so I kind of had to second guess and switch things out occasionally when things seemed a little bit too much like that, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B74\">is kind of hard for me, because it's... it goes back to my general problem of... ever since I was once told, and it's been told more than that by my in-laws, just be yourself. But what I am... but I am being myself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: And then I get these little bits of feedback that I have to second-guess who I am because I would rather just naturally be who I am. I really do. But the problem is, is that, when I'm being who I am, apparently it's not very authentic to a lot of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Well, or people just misread you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, but they don't think it's... they feel as if it's very... I am... I lean towards cheesy. That's just who I am. I talk about things that I'm especially proud of somebody for this or... that's just who I am. [0:18:00] I lean towards using words that other people don't, partially because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">I'm looking for a concise feeling or emotion towards it. But sometimes it's just that that's the word that comes to mind immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: But it's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, a few minutes ago you used the word sagacity, which is... I know what it means, but it's not one you hear every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Oh my God, sagacious. That is true. To me that's exactly though to me what it is. It's... it is one who's sage-like. In terms of what... because especially among my co-workers I mean that from the heart, because I think they say things almost Yoda-like to these children. And the children are <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">like, oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: And then [they're walking out there] (ph), and I feel like I've just seen some sort of Buddha-like wisdom imparted to these children. [0:18:57] So I really mean that word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I'm not just saying it to impress anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I didn't think you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: No, I didn't think you did either, but that's just... I mean, the reason why I say these words is because it's exactly what I mean, it's the emotion that I'm feeling at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Right. Sometimes you can get a connotation with a word like that that's what you want and that you can't otherwise get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Especially because of the fact that I feel like sometimes praise is very cheap in certain situations...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Either from myself or other people. And sometimes... for example, something like, oh, you must be really smart. That is true, but that is so bland. And that is not... it's not... to me it's not measurable. It's not concise. It's... I want to give, in what I write and when I speak about certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">things... I want to make sure that it is something that is... it almost has a mood to it, but it also has [something that's measurable] (ph). [0:19:56] It is something that is very... it imparts what I'm trying to say. And so it is difficult for me when I do get this information... and I haven't gotten <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">it in a while. But there are people in my life, every once in a while when I'm just not looking I get blindsided by this point in which I get wrapped in this whole thing of, well, just be yourself. And I'm like, crap. I am being myself. What am I supposed to do now? (Laughing) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: And so I sort of faked these... and at various different periods of time I have these almost personas that I... to get out of those situations that I have. Not personas... I don't even know how to explain this. I have these fake personalities in which I try to do certain behaviors that are socially <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">acceptable around these people so that they can cope with that? Most... almost all of them involve... for example, a work-related one. [0:20:57] I was told that I was not very approachable because of the kind of way I use words and this and that and all that kind of stuff. And so I had... so then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E32\">started to pick up... putting smilies (sp?) in my e-mail. But the smilies did a lot for people thinking that I seem more approachable. I thought that was extremely unprofessional in a workplace environment. But then in various different types of... things, like being excited about new lip gloss or this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E33\">or... yes, I mean, sometimes it's helpful. But not... I had to take a serious interest in this stuff so that I had something to talk about that they would find approachable as opposed to the things that I'm really excited about and things I find really interesting. And boy, that's a giant pain in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E34\">ass, because I don't like having to try and be somebody different than who I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: And so... I mean, we all do it a little bit. [0:21:58] But the biggest reason why I don't like to do it is because I have seen my poor husband who... he doesn't try to be... he expends so much energy of his life trying to be what... at any given time, what somebody wants him to be, such that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">I sometimes wonder... I feel like I know the real him. But then I start to wonder, is he... is that really what he wants... he thinks that I want, and therefore sees as...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: I don't think so, because it's really hard to keep that up long term, I would think, as opposed to just with a boss. When you live with someone a lot, it's a lot harder to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: But it is... it's got to be... I see it as exhausting for him. Living and dying by all of your behavior, trying to make other people happy is exhausting. And so... yeah, I don't want that to happen. (Pause) [0:22:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Well, and it's insulting, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: I'm not sure if I understand that, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Well, what I mean is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: To the person, or the person doing it, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, to the person who's having to do it, because there's some...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Oh, okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Implication somewhere, not necessarily on the part of the person you're in front of... in other words (pause), usually it means somebody felt like it... may be feeling it wasn't okay to just be as you are, that was wrong in some fashion, or not good enough in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's such a left-handed compliment with certain things. There's something where they're trying to tell you one thing, but what they're really actually saying is something pretty mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Like, the equivalent of... and I had a roommate who did this to another roommate, of, you have such beautiful clothes. Can I borrow them because you don't ever get a chance to use them, kind of thing, because you don't ever get to go anywhere kind of stuff...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: I see. [0:24:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: That kind of... just be yourself, but obviously being... it's supposed to sound like... it sounds like it's a nice thing to say, but really it's a really horrible thing to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: So... yeah. I just... I guess for me the big thing is that my ideal situation is where I wouldn't have to be like that. I mean, we all have certain things that you do that for. I mean, and I was raised that there are things like that. Like, pretend you're in court (laughing), for example. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">doesn't matter who you are. You have a very set set of behavior. There are certain things that you do this with, when you're having conversations with certain people. But these are very small... I mean, they're such rare situations that they're ritualized and... but not a day to day thing. [0:24:54] <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B2\">One of the things that really bothered me actually with certain things in my life is when there were situations where people who claim that they really are wanting... they're really open to anything, and they want you to absolutely be that way, except for the fact that, when you don't fit in, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B3\">it's like everything but you. I do this to be individualistic, just like all of my friends, kind of bullshit, that kind of stuff? That really bothers me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2010A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: But sometimes that means, be yourself as long as yourself is a very particular way, that looks like it's just authentic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so... exactly. [0:26:04] So I felt like I was pretty much... the whole time I was in Seattle I felt like a some sort of anthropologist. So... and I'm weird, trust me. I started a blog about weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: So... (Pause) I don't know. And that's actually something else.

And that's the kind of things that... or just in general. I see strange signs or... there's a picture... there's someone's house that has a little... what's it called?

Stonehenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: There's... in their front yard there's a Stonehenge. I accidentally met the person because I posted it for Happy Summer Solstice with the picture of Stonehenge on it and things like that. And now they're sort of famous. But I... yeah, I've been sort of just taking pictures of the crazy things <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">that I see and posting them. And mostly it's just a picture blog of weird... with occasional funny comments about something. And I'm finally doing that. And it is true, he's right, that by laughing about it... even if I... I mean, I don't... really, it's nice to know about the statistics and things <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F2\">like that, of people who read it. But it's not really about that?

And so I guess it was just really... <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B1\">you want some more? I guess it just really was a big letdown to me to be able to not get the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">CLIENT: It's... especially because of the fact that it's not even like a no-place-is-good-enough-for-me thing, because I have totally had situations where I'm like, here I am.

(Pause) I don't know. (Pause) I guess part of the thing is that... (Pause) [0:33:58] It really is partially me but partially just (pause) feeling out of place, I guess. I don't know. This is one of those things where I really... and this is... might be my memory just maybe is kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201871\">on the spot, I don't know. But I'm having a hard time thinking about it. But it really is something where I felt like I just hadn't been quite... felt as much comfortable and that kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) [You gather up all the] (ph) sort of impression (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah, or just thinking about the sense of it, yeah. Well, for a really good example, at one point... this was a little over a week ago, I was having problems with an asthma attack. I'm lying on the ground, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Oh my God. [0:34:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">CLIENT: Like, I'm lying on the ground holding my asthma inhaler... I'm sorry, I was chasing after the bus that decided not to stop. Sometimes the bus drivers... I guess they skip stops, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">CLIENT: I end up lying on the ground, right? And I just got so pissed because I had a couple people actually walk over me to get on their way. I'm like, you know what? I understand you don't want to get involved. But fucking walk around me. I'm sorry, but that is just... that is a message in my head <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201931\">to say, I don't give a damn, by walking over you. There was plenty of room on the sidewalk to walk around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">CLIENT: That kind of stuff.

You may not want to say anything, like, are you okay? But walking over somebody, really? But this is mostly a place where we're so concerned about everything. We're supposed to be concerned about people's mental wellbeing. We're worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B1\">enough about that, and we're worried about that. But yet walking over somebody, really? That kind of thing. [0:35:55] But I can't think of anything immediately. Oh, in general, something nasty, like the whole slew of nasty... like, back when I had a car, nasty letters I would get on my car, that kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right. I [remember those] (ph), yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">CLIENT: It's actually spawned out of the nasty letters I used to get, this whole posting things. But I would never post anything as negative as that. But this whole... why in the world would anyone find the need to say... passive-aggressive... it seems like there's less direct contact I get with people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F1\">And it's not like I'm... like I wanted to have conversation. I'm not looking that Midwest... like, everyone-want-to-be-friends kind of thing. But it seems like it's actually they seek out specifically extremely passive-aggressive ways to let you know that you're not conforming, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2019E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559754\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A3\">CLIENT: And that's what really gets me kind of... either leave me alone, ignore me, or speak to me. [0:37:00] Don't leave me nasty messages on my car because you perceive that I am actually not handicapped. Don't write mean messages about how you're going to do terrible things to the cardboard because <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A31\">I didn't know that they needed to be in three by three squares instead of four by four squares.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A7\">CLIENT: Ring my bell, talk to me.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">CLIENT: That kind of thing. (Pause) So... (Exhaling) that kind of just very... that kind of frustration. And, like, I said, I know it isn't just them. It is partly... and I know more than half of it is me. I just wasn't in... I... a lot...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">THERAPIST: How is it you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AF\">CLIENT: I have a lot of baggage, and therefore I'm not necessarily willing to have a good sense of humor about something.

That isn't... well, maybe a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B5\">THERAPIST: I mean, people stepping over you on the ground when you're incapacitated. That's not really much you. [0:38:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Now, I did find out after the fact that there is actually a real reason why potentially that people were too busy. But I still think they could have walked around me. This was about the same time that there was... it actually was the same time that there was some sort of emergency, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B71\">they were re-bussing people around from Kendall (sp?) somewhere else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... but the point though is that you still don't do it over somebody. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">CLIENT: But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">THERAPIST: You're not really implicated there. You didn't choose (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">CLIENT: No, but I'm talking about also just in general...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Could have been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I actually really don't like attention when I'm like that, either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB\">CLIENT: I would prefer that you walk around me than, if I can't... than actually engage me to see if things are okay, because usually... it's not even that the... (Pause) [I'm trying to play it both ways here] (ph), I guess. [0:38:54] I don't know. I don't want you to bother me. If I need help, I will <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB1\">ask for help. But... (Pause) Usually... I don't know. It's weird. It's... but I also... like I said, I was in a... just a very frustrated... I've had situations where I have broken down and not wanted to deal with the situation. I basically got frustrated way too early on than I should have and became <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB2\">bitter and angry about certain things. And so... (Pause) I don't know. It's one of those things, I guess. I just... (Pause) Part of it is that I have a lot of... did I say baggage stuff going on? I have a lot of crap going on in my life right now, so I don't really have a good open mind often, I guess. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB3\">I don't... I want to make friends.

I don't know where in the world I... how in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB1\">world I didn't know about this, but I got extremely bitter and pissed and betrayed with I don't know who, because I didn't know that the person who is running this cooking show is actually a very famous porn star.
