I\u2019m sorry about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It not a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Talk to your landlord maybe about getting ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So, feel good today, until you just, you know, reprimanded me; but, I\u2019m a big boy. I can handle it. (sniffs). But, I get a call like Thursday morning from my mom. Grandma E is in the hospital and she\u2019s not supposed to make it through the night. She\u2019s in a coma. I\u2019m getting, you know, all these\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So she\u2019s flying out there, and she\u2019s telling me to book a flight, you know?  Funeral is going to be, first maybe tomorrow, then Sunday, then whatever, you know? (sniffs) But, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not booking a flight until I know when the funeral is, especially at these prices. And, (sighs) you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">of course she doesn\u2019t die right away, and she ultimately is; so, I\u2019m kind of stressed out. It\u2019s not unexpected that she was going to die. I\u2019m just\u2014no one had told me that she was that sick, you know? No one ever tells me when she goes in the hospital. I mean, she\u2019s been in the hospital, I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">it\u2019s just\u2014I\u2019m always kept out of the loop on these things, you know? And see and I think the stress of sort of redoing all my schedule, asking for extensions on things, and still not knowing, but presumptuous (crosstalk) I\u2019m going to fly out to Oregon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You made all those sorts of arrangements (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: So she finally dies, our time, about noon on Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh, sorry to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Thank you. And Ian (ph) and I have tickets to fly down Thursday to Austin for the football game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: This coming Thursday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yea. So I was stressed out about just the money to begin with because I\u2019m expecting all these checks to come in; they\u2019re not coming in; I\u2019m not going to be in the office to get the check and deposit. It\u2019s just all fucked up and still have Hertz (sp?) holding $500 on  my business card, though <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">it has not bounced anything. But, I was just pretty\u2014You know it probably wouldn\u2019t have been as bad, but I felt like, okay, here\u2019s the next kick in the head, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">So I get the text or whatever on voice-mail or whatever on Sunday, and I start looking at flights again; and, I\u2019m either going to\u2014for $500 it means that I\u2019m going to spend ten hours flying out there with a connecting flight, with a layover or paying over 500 for a nonstop that is either first thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">in the morning, the red eye, and coming back, the same thing, first thing in the  morning or the red eye. So I would be looking at getting back into Manchester either late in the day on Wednesday or Thursday morning and then turn around and fly down to Austin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I, first of all, don\u2019t think I just physically have enough in me. I\u2019m not that busy. I went ahead and the loan that was funding today, I have already\u2014I went and printed checks and set up the overnights. I mean, literally, I could have just gone to a FedEx box in Oregon and disbursed the loan. But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">was like, \u2014and my mom, every time she called: \u201cYour Uncle Frank and I, we\u2019re okay if you don\u2019t come out here. Grandma E is not going to know the difference.\u201d My brother is going out there, which I\u2019m like, oh fuck. He\u2019s going out Monday and going home  Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561776\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">Finally I was like, funerals are for the living and the two people that I would be going for are like, don\u2019t come. So I decided not to go, obviously, the funeral is today at 1:00. I decided not to go. But then there are little things, like I get a phone call from my mom last night. All the grandkids <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">are going over to her apartment to pick out stuff, a few things. And at first I\u2019m just like, I cannot even think of anything specific. Nothing came to mind. So, I said, just  pick me out a few things or whatever. But as time went on, and I know that they\u2019ve already gone and raided Grandma\u2019s\u2014whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">my mom hasn\u2019t taken (chuckles) you know. There actually were some art, you know like Jewish art and stuff. She had some Chagall (sp?) with the stained glass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I was like that would be cool to have that, you know. But by then, it was just like too late and I was like, fuck it, and so. I guess I\u2019ll see what I end up with, you know? So that\u2019s just been a huge (phone ringing) mess, but I\u2019m a bit relieved today. I\u2019ve been getting all these faxes from all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">over the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: On my regular phone line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Hmph.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really crazy. I can\u2019t like tell if they\u2019re faxes or computers trying to call in. It sounds more like an old modem than it does really a fax machine, you know? Because you don\u2019t hear that (mimics beeping sound.) You hear the handshake (mimics noise.) But I feel  better today. Yesterday I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">was just a little nauseous and I probably ate too much too quick Sunday, you know what I mean, really crappy, but (chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Then about my tenant who said \u201cOh I sent the check a couple of weeks ago.\u201d So the (inaudible). It hasn\u2019t come. I\u2019ve looked everywhere, and I did. I went crazy with him, like I\u2019m actually thinking at the point I threw it out. I was like, all right, send me a replacement check. He was like \u201cSure.\u201d So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I\u2019m like, hmm, he was a little too quick on that replacement check thing, no stop payment, nothing, you and, sure enough, the check comes last night and you would  think that it would be dated, the 5th, the 6th. It was postmarked on the 6th, dated Nov 20, when he said he originally sent the check. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">like he can\u2019t even take the extra step (cross laughter) to void the check and write a new one with a December date. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">This guy\u2019s a lawyer. So, (deep breath) I went and saw Dr. Billings (ph). I\u2019ve got this thing on the top of my head and Marcia\u2019s sister died from skin cancer. And she\u2019s all\u2014I\u2019m like, yeah, I got an appointment with my primary care. I also got the test results, you know the report from the ER from my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">accident, which all throughout it, \u201cWe told patient to go see primary care. You look at my discharge. Nothing on there about following up with the primary care. So  now I got an appointment. Of course I don\u2019t know if I can keep it because it was yesterday. I go, maybe it would be a good point to maybe\u2014I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">think I was worried about them just changing my meds and fucking with that again, you know? But, Marcia is like, \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to go to the dermatologist. Your primary care is not going\u2026\u201d\u2014No I\u2019ve got a very good primary care. He\u2019s a young guy. He really knows his shit and it\u2019s like he wants to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">a primary care, you know? Not that he sucks so bad that the only job he could get was primary care.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561776\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">So hey, it\u2019s snowing. The storm\u2019s coming. So he looks at it and there\u2019s a name for it. I\u2019m like, that sounds pretty scary. He goes, \u201cwell don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not cancer.\u201d I\u2019m like what  do I tell Marcia because she is going to be, \u201cOh, you still need to go see a dermatologist.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cThis is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">the woman who put the bike key (laughter, cross laughter). I told her that and she\u2019s like, \u201cYou got burned by Dr. Billings.\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, you know, you could probably get an appointment in six months, had this thing for years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">But I don\u2019t know if he thinks I\u2019m a hypochondriac or\u2014He really didn\u2019t\u2014Oh he did tell me I should be taking Abilify. Micah tells me to take Abilify. I asked her how much. She said two and I\u2019m like, (shuh) what does that mean? I decided just not even to take it. He told  me I should take it. He says it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">very good. I was like, hey you just watch the commercials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">I\u2019m meeting with her next week anyway when I get back. It\u2019s weird because usually I\u2019m stressed out by travel. The Oregon would have stressed me out, but going down to Austin, at least right now, I\u2019m not worried about the trip. I\u2019ve got nothing going on, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">So (deep breath) I am meeting with this woman today. Calls me on the phone. She\u2019s just all over the place, huge estate. She\u2019s owed $300 something thousand. She is on disability. Same story, disability, Social Security, going to lose the house next month, I haven\u2019t made a payment in like three years <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">to any mortgage company, and they haven\u2019t even started foreclosure. In fact, Chase actually sent me a check for $3,000 and change for doing  something wrong in the foreclosure as part of some sort of settlement, which\u2014I don\u2019t even know how I was damaged, but\u2014so the one thing I did pick up on that really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">got me to stop and think was, she was like \u201cI\u2019m a paralegal.\u201d And she was like \u201cI filed some Motions that court filed an Order for the clerk not to accept my Motions anymore.\u201d Then she says, \u201cBut I got around that.\u201d (cross laughter) I\u2019m like (chuckles) do I really even want to talk to this woman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">But, you know, once again I\u2019m not in the position to be turning around business (crosstalk) and a lot of my experience\u2014in fact she got me from a list\u2014I .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I see. So that means you can just basically get out of working for (inaudible) .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I can set up what I will work on her for, and you\u2019ve got to carefully draft an agreement, I will work on this, and then everything you do, you come up with a new agreement. But there\u2019s no real\u2014I have to be, it\u2019s not like these are indigent people, so I can charge my regular fee with this one <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">with this one, which I will hopefully that will  (crosstalk) So I figured it would just be good experience. I\u2019ve never dealt with it from the fighting over the money side other than advising him (ph) about his estate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">His sister sent me a doozy of a message on Facebook. I mean, like Hall of Fame, you know, classic. I mean this was, this was great. Booty wasn\u2019t surprised by it all. But you know when people tell you stuff and you\u2019re wondering if they\u2019re embellishing how bad the situation is? \u201cShe\u2019s bad-mouthing me <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">and my family, wum, wum, wum.\u201d I have no reason to believe that he\u2019s an embellisher, but a lot of it, I was just like, \u201cYou\u2019re kind of an abrasive person.  You\u2019re probably at some fault here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561776\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">Here it goes, (reads) \u201cHi Cameron, you may or may not recall meeting me at my father\u2019s wake. I\u2019m Karl\u2019s sister, Rachael. I saw your post on my brother\u2019s timeline.\u201d The post was, he had a picture of himself giving a guy a big hug and he\u2019s got a mustache. So, based on the mustache, I said, \u201cHey, what, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">are you doing, porn again?\u201d So that\u2019s the message she sees. (train whistle). \u201cI saw your post on my brother\u2019s timeline and wanted to take the opportunity to thank you so much for your prompt response to my father\u2019s accountant with regard to the outstanding mortgage my father was attempting to recover <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">at the time that his brother, and my brother up until September, was acknowledging he owed. None of that\u2019s true.\u201d Of course I didn\u2019t even respond to the  accountant from the estate, because, I had nothing and whatever. So she\u2019s taking a dig at me there. (reads) \u201cYou may or may not know that, on top <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200513\">of this large sum of money he will be walking away with, we, (the accountant and myself,) have all\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Walking away with\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: (inaudible) Yeah. (reads) \u201cWe have all of the quarterly statements on our father\u2019s investment accounts showing proof that brother had been fraudulently trading on a dead man\u2019s account and collecting the broker fees.\u201d I don\u2019t know how you can collect fees, but, you know, basically he had been <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">trading stocks for his dad and he wanted to\u2014first they were going to keep the positions and then liquidate them or whatever and he wanted\u2014basically there were all of these options that he had just sort of rolled over and unwind or else they were going to become worthless or the estate would have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">take delivery of the gold, which would be more\u2014so, (reads) \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re not aware that your lack of cooperation not only protects your good pal, but harms his sister as well, and I thank you from the bottom  of my heart. I have lost both of my parents and now, thanks to my brother\u2019s fraud and theft, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200553\">I am losing my home. I expect my brother to lack integrity. I did not expect that of you. My father thanks you.\u201d Hall of Fame right there. The only thing she missed was turning me over, so I blocked her. No reply. I wanted to reply, but\u2014 he wasn\u2019t surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">But, (pause) I think, like Saturday, I kind of started feeling a little better about  accepting that I may not go down to\u2014It would have cost over a $1,000. Let\u2019s say I had to try and move my Thursday flight to Austin to Friday? I mean, first of all, there may not even be two tickets together because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">it\u2019s the football team playing down there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you feel a little guilty about not having\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: I do feel guilty about not having gone. I mean I\u2019m constantly trying to justify this, you know? It\u2019s going to be a few hundred dollars, the difference in price. So we\u2019re looking at over a thousand bucks I don\u2019t have. My mom may kick in some, but she ain\u2019t going to kick in a thousand bucks.

Part of it is because my brother is going and he\u2019s one-upping me. Ever since he got married and got pregnant, he\u2019s been one-upping me. So I\u2019m (chuckles). Yeah, I don\u2019t know, I feel like it\u2019s something I should do. I feel like my excuse is going to a football game. Grandma E always <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">would tell the story how, after school, first year, I drove down and caught a bunch of Phish (sp?) shows on the way down, one of them being in Nashville  when she still lived there. So I crashed with them and went to the show. So she would always tell this, how, yeah comes to visit me to so see Phish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">I was jokingly telling Marcia, I go \u201cOh, I think Black Joe Lewis is out in Portland. Maybe I should catch him. Grandma would appreciate that.\u201d So, yeah, I feel guilty, but (deep breath) it\u2019s just there is constantly\u2014there\u2019s always a financial component to all of these things which just makes it more <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">difficult for me to try and manage it, you know? And at some point, I should be getting a check from the estate or it should be in the trust. If it\u2019s not in the trust, I\u2019m going to reprimand my uncle. Though it\u2019s Oregon, so who knows how things work out .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">I opened an account and I\u2019m having him suck out a little bit of money every month and, they\u2019re not going to give me a log-in or any way of touching the money, other than calling him up and saying to pull some money from my account. So I figure the one thing I really need to work on is having some sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">of, you know, cushion for either a month that\u2019s bad or a few months, or I get sick again. (coughs) So I figure the inheritance is a good way to sort of get that going. (deep breath) Either that or I would probably blow it on paying people like you  the money I owe them.\u2014You got a statement for me at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yea, I have to put one of those together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019ve got a check for you again, but I\u2019m beyond my out-of-pocket, so they should be checks for the full amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019ll look it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Coming. They didn\u2019t even ask me for my copay yesterday, so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s, you know. So, I don\u2019t know (pause). Things are going well with the kids sleeping over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Something that really bothered me last night was (sighs) Ian (ph) and this is a non-sleepover night, but we\u2019re getting ready to go, and Ian, all night has been  jumping on the bed. The bed is on wheels and it moves. I\u2019m just like tired of putting the bed back in place. Then, on my dresser, where <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">I put my wallet and my keys, there\u2019s all kinds of knickknacks and stuff. He\u2019s always over there playing with shit and, I just, I don\u2019t know. (crosstalk). So first I told him to stop with jumping on the bed. He won\u2019t stop doing it, so I\u2019m getting Lucille (ph) ready and I take her boot, which has a hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">sole, her snow boot, I just rap him on the head a little bit. I\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t hurt, but he tends to embellish his crying, you know? He does it in soccer, just\u2014so I showed no empathy, sympathy, whatever. I said, \u201cCome on, stop crying, it didn\u2019t hurt. I didn\u2019t hit you that much.\u201d I said \u201cI told <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F3\">you to stop touching everything.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561776\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">What does he do? He goes over and he starts\u2014subconsciously I know he\u2019s doing this,  but he goes over and he starts playing with shit on the dresser again. I\u2019m like, \u201cJust get out of the room. Go sit down.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">I mean, you know. He didn\u2019t give me a hug when I left. Usually he runs up to give me a hug. He\u2019s like \u201cBye Daddy,\u201d but usually he kind of comes up and gives me a don\u2019t go kind of hug. But I\u2019m torn because I feel bad because I lost my temper. But I\u2019m also just to the point where I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">doing. I know she gets mad at him and what not, but I want there to be certain rules in my house (crosstalk) and I want them to followed, you know? I know he\u2019s got to learn them. The reality is that I didn\u2019t hit him that hard. It\u2019s not any more than I got spanked as a kid and telling him to stop isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200732\">working, so a little rap on the head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">He\u2019s hitting me. Lucille is constantly hitting me. He\u2019s like \u201cLucille, you don\u2019t hit Daddy like that, you hit him like this\u201d. Which I know a lot of it is my fault because I do a lot of play like that, so I\u2019m sure smacking him on the head\u2014I\u2019m waiting for a text from Jess. She\u2019s probably holding back, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">but I\u2019m sure he told her. I felt bad about that last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">But then Marcia came over and I forgot all about it. Yeah, she told me how depressed she was about fucking up my car, the fact that I didn\u2019t yell at her, get upset, or\u2014all her friends were like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d You can\u2019t just take it out on the kids. I\u2019m like \u201cIt was a mistake. What\u2019s yelling <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">at you going to do?\u201d We\u2019ve been dating four or five years. I (inaudible) yelled  at ya.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">Same thing happened with Jess. She did something really fucked up and I just let it go. So she was like \u201cOh that was so...\u201d She brought it up years later. She was like, that was really cool that you didn\u2019t get upset with me. I don\u2019t even remember, but it was fucked something up. Of course, years later, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">she does something stupid and I yell at her, so that stuff only lasts (inaudible) (sigh) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">You know I don\u2019t know why today I feel better. I\u2019m not as nauseous. I think I\u2019ve also  got nothing sort of stressful today. It\u2019s a nice, relaxing day. I\u2019ve got time to squeeze everything in. You know part of it is that I haven\u2019t rescheduled any chiropractic appointments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: A lot of what you\u2019re talking about today is feeling really behind the eight ball and like you\u2019re fucking everything up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: Is that new?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: I got\u2014my Christmas cards came in and so now it\u2019s like one more thing I\u2019ve got to do and I feel like that\u2019s something I really should do before I leave, but it\u2019s not going to happen. But I think I\u2019m going to set it up in pieces. I think the most important ones to get out are actually the people <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">who bought homes this year. Just, \u201cHope you\u2019re enjoying your home. Happy Holidays\u201d you know? Then I got a good idea from the guy who owns the mortgage company. It was like, you know, he keeps track of people, but he gives them a number. So if he doesn\u2019t  really think the person is worth, you know (crosstalk) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200832\">pursuing a relationship with, he gives them a one, but someone he really wants to, it would be like a four or like a four-point scale or whatever. So when it comes to something like Christmas cards, I\u2019m not going to buy 1,000. I bought 150. (crosstalk) I\u2019ve got more than 150 people to send them to. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200833\">So I would be able to figure out who in that grouping I would send to based on their number. I don\u2019t have that system in place yet, but I feel like I\u2019ve got to get the cards out. So I\u2019m going to try and work on some today. Tomorrow I\u2019ve got nothing going on, but I\u2019m going to be down in, going down to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200834\">Norwalk tonight, so. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561776\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">So I don\u2019t know. (sighs) The one good thing was that I was able to\u2014even though I was in town, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t go because I found out, literally, like noon, an hour before the game, that Grandma E died and then I would have been out there tail-gating and, you know, having a good time. I wouldn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">enjoyed the game and\u2014miraculous comeback. I don\u2019t know if you heard about it, but a minute and a half left in the game, it\u2019s like it\u2019s over, it\u2019s done and somehow they scored two touchdowns to win the game in a minute and a half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: They actually did it in a minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: They left 30 seconds on the clock. Yeah, (crosstalk) they scored, and then they got the onside kick and there was a 15-yard penalty on the first score, so the onside kick was  15 yards further up. Then they got a pass interference in the end zone, so they get the ball on the one-yard line, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">made two scores. It was unbelievable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">I think I\u2019m feeling a little better too because I won my fantasy football matchup which has a lot of ironies and permutations that made it very enjoyable. The guy who runs the league I\u2019m playing in\u2014I won the Super Bowl last year by one point. He was heavily favored. I beat him earlier in the season <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">by 51 points, which is a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">I was also a fan, so I\u2019m playing in the first round of the playoffs and, it\u2019s ironic that he\u2019s a fan, but he\u2019s got Tom Brady and Gronk and also there is this guy who has won a couple of times who just, for health reasons or what not, decided not to play this year. But he\u2019s kind of hierarchy, kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200911\">co-captain. So he comes in and just starts blasting my team  and how bad they are, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">So we\u2019re going back and forth. So that was a lot of fun and then to actually win because number one, the Browns start\u2014I get a text from Kevin, you know, \u201cYay, (clapping) the Browns are dominating, damn it.\u201d Because Brady and Gronk had no points. Then, first Adrian Peterson gets hurt for him and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">Gronk gets hurt and I end up winning. It\u2019s true, if those guys had their regular games, I probably would have lost. He\u2019s like, it\u2019s all luck. I go, \u201cYea, you know you\u2019re the first person in the entire history and universe of fantasy sports to lose a playoff game because someone got injured.\u201d I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200932\">(chuckles) I mean, you know, it happens to everybody. Of course there\u2019s luck. You can\u2019t win it without luck, but you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">So that makes me feel good. I haven\u2019t taken fantasy football as seriously from following it and really spending time with it, but this league is important. It\u2019s a tough league, so how I  perform in there means a lot to me. It would be great if I won back-to-back championships. It\u2019s going to be tough, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">but we\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s been a mixed bag, but it\u2019s a huge relief though that I don\u2019t have a lot going on this week. But I\u2019ve got some money coming in for some new I got a new collection and some old money coming in from things I\u2019ve done. The big thing that hurts is that I wanted to sending Flo money. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">lent me $4000. She kind of wanted half of it back in November and I just haven\u2019t been able to. She has mentioned a thing. My dad hasn\u2019t mentioned it. I  just want to walk down there and hand her a check for $1000 I might actually be able to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561776\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">THERAPIST: Well, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">CLIENT: But I wouldn\u2019t have if I flew out to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">CLIENT: I also bounced those two checks to my landlord which I didn\u2019t talk to him about. I want to make sure that the money\u2014even with those checks, because now that I got the rent check, I still think there might be enough money. It\u2019s going to make it tight for me, but I think I owe her. I mean she <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F1\">won\u2019t give her own kids money. No interest. I owe her a favor. I end up bringing her step-grandson down. So I\u2019m going to have to ship off Friday night with  her son and granddaughter. So my dad says\u2014her name is Casey (sp?) She\u2019s like five. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh it\u2019s about time someone got in Casey\u2019s pants.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F2\">(chuckles) I don\u2019t know if should tell Marcia that one or not. Did I tell you my Bill Clinton joke? Did I do my Bill Clinton joke for ya? It\u2019s a little past the seasonal thing, but you\u2019ve got to get the (imitating Bill Clinton) \u201cWhat do ya call a blow job that lasts for eight days?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: \u201cA Hanukkah Lewinsky.\u201d (silent chuckle) I told that to everybody out in  Oregon to kind of cheer them up, you know? I told my mom and I\u2019m like you\u2019ve got to tell this to everybody, but you\u2019ve got to do the Bill Clinton voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">CLIENT: Because I don\u2019t think I do it very well, but I bet my mom would be worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">Yeah, I don\u2019t know, I mean it\u2019s like the Abilify and all these meds. I\u2019m now on Concerta and Ritalin and I feel like it\u2019s not doing as well for me as the Adderall was, but do I just gotta suck up and pay the extra? Now when I think about it, it\u2019s $40 a month for\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Is that why you\u2019re not on the Adderall now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yea. It\u2019s the extended release that is like $60. Yea, I gotta pay 50 percent of whatever the cost is. I do the same thing for Viagra, but that\u2019s a social drug, so you\u2019re expected  to spend lots of money on that. First payment on that was like $70 to $80 and now it\u2019s like $40 $50 or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD1\">I really don\u2019t even take them anymore, but I figure, might as well have them. The worst thing I can do is just sell them to old ladies who are having trouble getting sex from their man. Go up to Marcia\u2019s mom, she\u2019s 78, \u201cYou want a couple of these?

She laughs at me. I know she gets that I\u2019m out of shape. I think she has a hard time believing I\u2019m that out of shape. I have a hard time accepting that I\u2019m that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B11\">out of shape. I\u2019ve put on weight and, I don\u2019t know, at some point I\u2019ve got to really motivate to just start doing some squats and for the rough stuff, she gives me like two 2-pound dumbbells and that\u2019s too much for me. But I figure at least getting my legs in shape, it would help with my\u2014I don\u2019t ride <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B12\">my bike anymore. I just gotta get out there. It felt  good.

She said I don\u2019t have to buy her a present, but I\u2019m not going to do that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">CLIENT: She has a problem (crosstalk) with the dogs trying to come into the front seat, so I was going to buy some sort of cage or, which I imagine is not cheap, and I\u2019ve got to do it soon. But it all depends on when money comes in, you know? But it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s coming in. It\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB1\">hurt, you know $100 a month, $25 a week, but I think knowing that money is there and not having access to it \u2013because I\u2019m going to know how much is there. I\u2019m going to get statements. Every transfer I\u2019m going to make, I\u2019m going to know, it\u2019s all in Quicken  you know, but the ability (crosstalk). What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">THERAPIST: How much are you going to put over?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">CLIENT: $100 a month to begin with. If I do have a situation where I do have a good month, just call them up and say pull some money over. But I\u2019ve got to start thinking about all of these medical bills too. You know? I was very angry. I was going to fight and now I\u2019m just going to all sending them <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF1\">$50 a month from my savings account, whatever. I mean I owe (inaudible) that is like $2,000. That doesn\u2019t include the doctor. The doctor is another $800, radiology, you know, (inaudible) . (blows breath) Insurance company reimbursed for my toe for the ignition so I got that $60. Marcia is only in for <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF2\">$790 at this point. I told them to pay me my lost  wages though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re waiting for the whole PIP application to go through because they weren\u2019t paying the chiropractor either, or if there is some other delay. But I\u2019m going to try and e-mail them. I\u2019m thinking a lot about sort of upping my landlord tenant representations, focusing on tenants and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C11\">title examinations, sending stuff out to other lawyers, like me, you know offering my services and see what happens. Are we all out of time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">CLIENT: Put an extra quarter in the meter because I\u2019ve got a feeling I\u2019m going to (inaudible) .
