Well, I\u2019ll figure stuff out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, so change is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Try this, the pillow might be help to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t sit on it. [00:01:03.25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: No, if you put it on the back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: It kind of moves you up a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Did that make a difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, it does. I guess because you\u2019re sitting on the edge more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019re sitting my other chair was deep, that purple chair, and that helped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Okay. I feel like I\u2019m in a new space. It\u2019s weird, huh, how orientation really affects you, huh? It\u2019s like changing your thinking. So I had a stressful week and weekend. But I finally made it home. [00:02:07.00] We spoke last Wednesday, right? So I was too much into the two guy thing and it just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">got too much. And then I feel I realized that I need to kind of make a change and work on my core and find that again. [00:03:01.24] So over the break I have a deadline to meet so I\u2019m hoping that\u2019ll just take away that\u2019ll help me to get rid of distractions or put things in perspective. But (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">yeah, I mean going to Ohio to see Nelson [ph] and then coming back to Chris, that felt completely weird and why am I doing this sort of thing. [00:04:28.05] And his place is nice and I\u2019m thinking of I kept thinking of what you said about why can he not feel powerful about association. And I was wondering <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D3\">that\u2019s what we had built, and we built this place together and it\u2019s pretty because I contribute the aesthetics and he pays the rent. So it could have been like an equal partnership if I saw it that way but I didn\u2019t. [00:04:58.15] I felt smaller and taken care of and not independent, and so that\u2019s why <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D4\">I took stepped out. [00:05:12.14] I kind of when I saw that those two, I think the reason for being there and the reason for not being there (pause) then it\u2019s what you said, I have to remember why I stepped out. Every time I think of being at my place and anticipate the [inaudible] and build that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D5\">narrative that oh, I messed up and now I have to suffer, and this is my punishment. [00:06:01.19] So instead of that, remembering why I left Chris in the first place, or wanted to leave him in his place, remember that. I\u2019m not exactly remembering that anymore in the sense that it\u2019s not like a strong <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D6\">emotion anymore, so I have to kind of logically think about it. Think about it instead of that sensation, that feeling being there and guiding me, basically, to react. So I don\u2019t know. Yeah, and then I guess Nelson [ph] came back from Ohio and that was just like things between us got weird again because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D7\">over the weekend it was good or whatever, I don\u2019t know. [00:07:18.28] There\u2019s two sides to everything. I could say they\u2019re good and then but then I could qualify that statement and say all kinds of other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561592\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Well, so I talked to my other friends about him, this guy at school. I don\u2019t know why we just started talking about sex, and I tell him about my experiences and stuff. So yesterday he was like this guy is clueless is bed. I can just tell. [00:08:03.03] And then I was like no, but la, la, la, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">la, and he\u2019s like stop it. You don\u2019t need to say anything. I from what you\u2019ve told me, he\u2019s clueless. But then so you could say that. But I would say I don\u2019t mind because in my head the association is I\u2019m having fun and this is fun. I think of sex as dangerous and it should be like that, and with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">Chris it\u2019s all safe and comfortable so I don\u2019t have as much fun as I have with Nelson [ph] because in my head the association is [inaudible] But I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s association. It\u2019s also, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m more attracted to him. Maybe that\u2019s because of all the dangerous and all that stuff. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">it\u2019s also it\u2019s just that he\u2019s more confident and stuff. [00:09:01.02] So even though he might be clueless, according to my friend, I still kind of don\u2019t think of him that way. But yeah, so those are the qualifications I could make. And in Ohio, also, I felt like we were a little disconnected, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200314\">we were walking on the street and he wouldn\u2019t hold my hand or something. It never I don\u2019t really hold men\u2019s hands. But I guess I wanted to and he didn\u2019t at one point. And then we were talking, he said I want someone with more confidence, who\u2019s more confident. And then I brought it up this weekend <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200315\">and he was like that was badly put. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. So (pause) yeah, this weekend we kind of almost had a crisis, like a buildup. [00:10:17.03] Right now I\u2019m a bit more calm about it because I guess I tried to take care of myself. It took a while but yeah, it was Friday or something. I [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200316\">Facebook. How many times do I bring up Facebook here or if you\u2019re keeping count but it\u2019s like it really is becoming a source of anxiety, or it can be. So this woman, she\u2019s part of the women\u2019s group that I\u2019m part of, and I\u2019ve known her for a while but she has like a one year old daughter that we all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200317\">just adore. [00:11:03.12] So she had a birthday and she posted photos on Facebook and everyone from the women\u2019s group was invited but me. So it\u2019s like I was telling myself, I was observing [inaudible] I should be fine with this. I\u2019m going to be a bigger person. I\u2019m going to be fine. I\u2019m not going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200318\">freak out and all. But that didn\u2019t last very long so and then because she\u2019s friends with this other girl that I kind of yelled at at that party and then she yelled back at me. So I was like maybe that\u2019s the thing. Maybe they she had to make a choice. Maybe I wasn\u2019t nicer in the past. Maybe I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200319\">too down or whatever. [00:12:01.19] Like last time, maybe, when she invited me, maybe I wasn\u2019t as cheerful or who knows. And I was rationalizing it to the extent that we\u2019re part of a group and we come together and talk politics, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all of us will actually like each other. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003110\">I don\u2019t know, it just kind of snowballed a little bit. I her husband is a journalist and he\u2019s very he\u2019s been very supportive. He\u2019s always asking me about my writing every time we meet, and he\u2019s very supportive. He\u2019s like yeah, let me interview you, [inaudible] should create a buzz and all of that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003111\">So I was really afraid that if suddenly I was thinking, oh my gosh, everyone is talking bad about me in my community. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve left Chris; maybe it\u2019s because this woman has told everyone that I\u2019m dating Nelson [ph] because Nelson [ph] is her friend. [00:13:02.14] That\u2019s how I met him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003112\">Maybe everyone is really talking shit about me. So that whole thing just made me a little panicky on Friday. So I was yeah, I was a little on the edge. And then I had and then I met my one of my writer friends who\u2019s [inaudible] a large magazine and we had some sangria, a lot of sangria. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003113\">on Saturday, yeah, and then I was upset already because Nelson [ph] had not called the whole week. I was like wait a second, I go to Ohio and we\u2019re all we\u2019re supposed to be moving forward and all that. Like he just doesn\u2019t call and all that. [00:14:00.06] So Saturday I was at his place and he had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003114\">gone to pick up some friend and then we were going to go to another friend\u2019s place. And I was watching a movie on his iPad and then I just kind of looked into his e-mail and I noticed that he was e-mailing this woman about meeting up some [inaudible] with her. So then that just kind of made me panic <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003115\">even more. And I saw the e-mail exchange between him and this friend from the women\u2019s group. She was like yeah, she can be very volatile so I don\u2019t know if I can meet her one on one. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s lost her temper. It\u2019s happened in the women\u2019s group also once. She needs to work on herself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003116\">and blah, blah, blah. [00:15:02.26] So all of this at that moment was just like really, really freaking me out. And she was like yeah, I told you, Nelson, [ph] to be from day one I said be careful with this situation. And I think he said something like yeah, we\u2019ll wait and see what happens with this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003117\">but no matter what, our friendship is strong. So I was like in my head I was like this whole friggin\u2019 community that I pride myself on is turning on me. People are talking amongst themselves about me and this guy is just using me for sex and he\u2019s he can\u2019t let go of me because I\u2019m ready to sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003118\">with him and he that\u2019s the only area that he lacks in because he\u2019s very confident otherwise. [00:16:03.19] He\u2019s told me this: I appear to be very confident but I\u2019m so I\u2019m not sure of myself when it comes to this. And his ex-girlfriend left him because of this reason. She said they were incompatible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003119\">and all that. So she must\u2019ve really hurt him by doing that. So I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s in Ohio, he\u2019s going to {inaudible] places with these really confident women who are CEOs or managers or directors of corporations, and that\u2019s the sort of person he\u2019s going to marry but he\u2019s just going to fool around and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003120\">have fun with me. And again, that whole thing was just building up in my head. I\u2019m so poor, my mom is so poor, and I have to pay her rent and la, la, la. And I\u2019m just being used and [inaudible] victim\u2019s [ph] [inaudible] and this is kicking in, kicking in. And I was totally panicky once I saw those e-mails. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003121\">[00:17:13.06] And then so my stomach was upset. And then we went over to his Nelson\u2019s [ph] other friend\u2019s place and I had three drinks and then I started throwing up. I had the worst my worst hangover ever, like my heart was beating so fast and my head was spinning until 12 in the afternoon. So I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003122\">was like I have to kind of take a step back and figure out my center. Because I don\u2019t I the last time I had a hangover was in 2012 when I was involved with Victor [ph]and I just completely lost myself. [00:18:12.12] So I was like this is happening again and I don\u2019t want to go back to that. So since <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003123\">yesterday I\u2019ve just been [inaudible] since yesterday but and yesterday I was also meeting friends and stuff. All of who are guys by the way. I have no I have I need to work on making having women friends, but I think they\u2019ll have to be not coming from my community because I\u2019ve realized that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003124\">my community\u2019s just full of judgmental people and I just cannot work around that. [00:19:01.23] I don\u2019t know how to. If I fear what their opinion of me, how can I be myself around them. If I\u2019m not myself then what\u2019s the point of trying to be friends. Because I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried to be different, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003125\">but I think I can\u2019t be. Also I feel like I just have to really take a step back from Nelson [ph] and really give up trying to understand, wondering what he thinks about me. And because what does it matter. It doesn\u2019t really matter because what matters is what I think and what I am trying to do. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003126\">trying to establish myself and take care of my mom. [00:20:10.19] I feel like that\u2019s my core and I should build on that instead of chucking it away, destroying it. Even my mom, because she\u2019s a source of distress, but how do I change that. I was talking to another friend and he was like you should always <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003127\">remember that your mom\u2019s always going to be in your life and you will have to take care of that, and you shouldn\u2019t think of that as a burden. You should think of that as a blessing. And I was like wow, that\u2019s completely radical thinking. That\u2019s like you changing this room around. It\u2019s completely 180 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003128\">degrees change. But it\u2019s not impossible. It\u2019s I could I remember feeling that way, feeling grateful for being needed. [00:21:03.03] So I\u2019m working on that. Last week, all last week, I was helping her with her thesis. I was a little upset because I have my own work and I didn\u2019t do it, and that really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003129\">makes me very stressed out. But I\u2019m trying not to think of helping her as being a drain on my time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561592\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: The way you described the last several days it sounds like you\u2019re almost sort of stumbling into things with no sort of I mean now you\u2019re reflecting and thinking about it, but it\u2019s sort of like you weren\u2019t thinking. You were just sort of stumbling. And I don\u2019t know what happens at those <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200331\">times where somehow thinking goes out the window or I don\u2019t know, or if you have thoughts about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: No it does go out the window. It does. [00:22:01.27] Where do I start? I don\u2019t know. Stumbling is exactly what I\u2019ve been doing, stumbling back from Ohio to Chris\u2019s place, stumbling into his arms whenever I\u2019m upset or sad about Nelson [ph] [inaudible]. Not everything is stumbling. Helping out <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">my mom, that doesn\u2019t feel like stumbling for some reason, right? Does it feel like stumbling to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: I can\u2019t say what it feels like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, but you wouldn\u2019t use stumbling for that, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561592\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">THERAPIST: No, not necessarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">CLIENT: That seems like the right thing to do, like an investment and caring. That\u2019s more active. [00:23:01.18] It\u2019s not a passive thing. At some point it becomes passive and I\u2019m but that\u2019s getting way too deep into details. But yeah, I feel like those few days I was [inaudible] I could\u2019ve managed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D1\">my time a little better, like squeezed out a couple of hours here, a couple of hours there, so I could have done my own work a little bit. That maybe I was just being lax at times because of holidays and stuff. But I starting today and I was actually at my home working. I walked from there to here <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D2\">giving myself talks [inaudible] But yeah, I just with Nelson [ph] I feel like I\u2019m stumbling, and I don\u2019t want that. So I want to kind of rein in on the emotions and not I think of him and I just start panicking like [ph] now, just thinking of all of that that I was thinking of Saturday night [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D3\">him talking about me to that girl. Then I\u2019m like why am I scared, it\u2019s not my concern. Why do I give a fuck about what they think. And I really want to get to that point where I can just look at their faces and say, you don\u2019t matter to me. Or I don\u2019t care what you think about me. You have zilch effect <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D4\">on me. That is the goal but I\u2019m very far away from that right now. So how do I get there? The only way I can get there is working on myself and achieving my dreams. [00:25:04.19] I don\u2019t know why or how but it\u2019s become she\u2019s become this monster in my head now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: This woman that Nelson [ph] just e-mailed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s friends with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: No, he\u2019s the woman through whom I met Nelson. [ph]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, that person. Because you had mentioned someone else you thought he was e-mailing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, I don\u2019t know who she is. (pause) I maybe it\u2019s like some device in my head that just makes people into monsters. [00:26:06.24] I give them way too much importance than they actually need or deserve or rightfully should have. It\u2019s like she\u2019s the equivalent of the [inaudible] almost, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">right? Has some kind of power over me. So what\u2019s the friggin\u2019 reason? I cannot figure out. She the [inaudible] she knows a lot of powerful people in academia. I mean that would not have been directly helpful to me but she did introduce me to people at parties and stuff. [00:27:08.16] But at that point <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200492\">I was like okay, what do I do with this. I have no idea how to make [inaudible] this contact or that contact. I was blissfully unaware, which was nice. Yeah, what happens to me. Why do I turn some people into monsters? Do you have an idea? I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well all of they\u2019ve become monsters because they kind of turn into all the bad feelings that you have about you and them in [inaudible] The bad feelings that you have about the attitudes they\u2019re expressing to you and the bad feelings you have about them kind of morph into this monster. [00:28:09.22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: What about [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Angry at what they\u2019re saying. Sort of shame about yourself about what they\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Shame. Why shame? Why am I ashamed? It is shame, but why? So I\u2019m not confident, so I am volatile. Why is that so fucking shameful? I am totally [inaudible] myself. Why? Why do I feel such anxiety, such profound shame reading those words. [00:29:06.10] Why that panic. It\u2019s like and I only hurt <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">myself. I didn\u2019t maybe other times I\u2019ve had panic attacks I\u2019ve hurt others, and maybe I would\u2019ve hurt others except that there was no one to hurt at that time. It was just myself so I just took the hit. But why is that such cause for shame? (pause) Yeah, I cannot figure it out. [00:30:02.20] What <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">is shame? [inaudible] profound [inaudible] reflexive kind of an emotion. (pause) Is it when someone makes you feel like you did something wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561592\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: Maybe, but I was thinking about this. There\u2019s shame and there\u2019s guilt. And guilt is more about what you did, like you feel guilty. Shame seems so much more integral to who you are as a person, like you\u2019re bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">CLIENT: Or not good enough. [00:31:07.12] Because I was thinking those words that she wrote. Why do they cause me to feel such shame and hurt and anger. Because I thought they were coming from a point of judgment and hate. What if they were coming from a point of concern? I mean maybe that\u2019s not but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">it would help me personally a lot to think of that way thinking that way. What if she totally loves me and she\u2019s saying no, you\u2019re volatile and I don\u2019t want to talk to you right now when you\u2019re volatile. While she\u2019s like holding my hand. Why can\u2019t I imagine that scenario. I\u2019d feel a lot better about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200552\">those words if I thought that that\u2019s the point where they came from. I\u2019d be like okay, okay, I will work on myself or whatever, something else. [00:32:06.29] But that\u2019s beside the point. Yeah, so going back to shame means something that\u2019s about who I am, is that like yes, but people can change. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200553\">it\u2019s not like who I am is steady all the time. It\u2019s in flux, right? (pause) It\u2019s also the way people put things I think. I don\u2019t know. [00:35:02.24] I think Auranu [ph] tried to shame me but I just, for some reason, I was not shamed by him. I think this is completely inaccurate [inaudible] But he would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200554\">be telling me your behavior is completely immature. You\u2019re childish and this and that. But I would just look at him and go what are we talking about? I don\u2019t know why, maybe because I was so attracted to him or head over heels, just and he\u2019d try and hurt, like shame me I feel. Our last communication <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200555\">[inaudible] trying hard because he said stuff like if you\u2019d only I don\u2019t even think of you as a human being when you act that way, when you throw a tantrum and this and that. [00:36:12.29] And I was just like what are you saying? I don\u2019t see it, at that point. So but those words were said to shame me, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [inaudible] thing to say to someone. Shame on him for saying that to somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a terrible thing to say to somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it had no effect on me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. Like why? (pause) I don\u2019t know. I just wanted to be with him so badly I just was like I don\u2019t hear what you\u2019re saying. [00:37:07.07] Yeah, I totally did not take that. Maybe I did, but I feel like I didn\u2019t. And then the thing that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">that woman said in her e-mail also was definitely there to shame me bigtime. You are this, you\u2019re a con artist. That I definitely took to heart. And this woman, what she\u2019s saying is, again, like I could think of it as coming from a place of support. But she\u2019s volatile and I don\u2019t want to see her one <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D2\">on one. [00:38:08.03] That\u2019s what she said. So that\u2019s maybe not said too much to shame me. I don\u2019t know. Is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561592\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well it wasn\u2019t said to you. It wasn\u2019t said to shame you simply because partly because it wasn\u2019t said to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, but why does it have that profound effect on me when I think of her saying it to Nelson [ph] and then talking behind my back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not flattering. She\u2019s not saying what a great person you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">CLIENT: Why does that make me panic? (pause) Am I so afraid of losing Nelson [ph] or I don\u2019t think I would be. [00:39:14.02] And why does it make me panic so much when I think of him going out on dates with more confident women? Why? It shouldn\u2019t. I was desperate or very curious to ask him but I held <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200651\">my tongue. Like what do you do on these dates? What do these women say? What do they look like? How is your interaction? I wish there was a movie I could watch about you guys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel you\u2019re not one of those women he goes on dates with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, but I want to kind of cure myself of this desire to compare myself with them. [00:40:10.02] The only way [inaudible] is to compare maybe and be like okay, picture someone like that next to me. I might look far more shabby because my clothes might not be so nice but what the hell <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">is the content of their thought and their speech that I feel I cannot match? Sure, that would change a lot of monetary success and the fact that my [ph] maybe I wouldn\u2019t. [inaudible] but maybe if I did kind of put all my effort into it I would. Maybe if I came from a better family I would\u2019ve. But why <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200692\">go down that route of thinking anyway. Why feel so embarrassed and ashamed next to them? [00:41:09.15] Because I want to [inaudible] embrace [inaudible] first of all, no [inaudible] embrace that and fix it. Yeah, my apartment is very dirty because my roommates are filthy. There\u2019s no better way of describing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200693\">it. But I can clean it. It\u2019s not my mess but if I have to stay there I have to clean it. And I can do it. Instead of worrying about other people I could fix my own mess instead of running away from things. I could spend time with my mom and clean her apartment. And if people shame me then I don\u2019t need <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200694\">to hang out with such people. [00:42:15.12] I mean I understand that this woman didn\u2019t say those words to me so they\u2019re not they don\u2019t shame me, but if I feel weird about her talking to Nelson [ph] I don\u2019t have to see her. In fact I\u2019m kind of thinking of leaving the women\u2019s group because I just cannot <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200695\">manage my expectations. I feel like I see them so often and I want to get to know them personally, but if they don\u2019t think that they can cut me and my temper any slack then and besides, the group is there to make to help us support each other. [00:43:10.01] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200696\">I know I need to work on my temper but I feel like I have other I have had interactions with other people where that has not been a problem that much. With my editor friend, she\u2019s amazing, and yet can be scary. But I\u2019ve yelled at her for various things but I\u2019ve been like and she\u2019s like standing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200697\">there looking at me like this and I\u2019m like look, I love you but you\u2019re why did you do this. I\u2019m very mad at you for doing this. But we get over that because she\u2019s mature enough. So I want people like that in my life. [00:44:01.12] I know that not everyone can be that way. People are mostly sensitive <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200698\">and you need to work on your friendship to get there but and I\u2019ve only known her for a few months. I see her once a week in classes and such. I know I\u2019m going to I\u2019m defending my behavior here a little bit but it\u2019s like also trying to figure out how much of myself do I want to change and how much <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200699\">of myself I want to keep.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561592\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B\">THERAPIST: We need to stop.
