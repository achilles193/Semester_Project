They were going to give me a $10 drink ticket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">ANALYST: What was it for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: The Assyrian Cultural Educational blah blah something. You know, just one of those things where I just\u2026 I\u2019m at that place and I was like, I can say no to this and I\u2019m going to be fine. I would have liked to have gone, but that\u2026 And I\u2019d been fighting a cold off and on. So it\u2019s like, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">what the fuck am I doing? So I didn\u2019t do that. Then I had a major\u2014very, very temporary but major blow up with my mom, where she called me one night, I was at George\u2019s house, and she\u2019s like, \u201cThe tenant slipped and fell,\u201d blah, blah, blah, blah. She wasn\u2019t upset or anything, she was like, \u201cThey just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">fell. Maybe if you could put salt.\u201d I was like, yeah, whatever. Couldn\u2019t find any salt or sand anywhere to buy, so I bought cat litter.

It\u2019s dirty every\u2026\u201d You know, just\u2026 I don\u2019t know what happened, dude, but it was just another one of those, I just was done. And I waited\u2026 I was at the post <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">office, so I was like shaking. The minute I got into the car I dialed her, and the minute she answered just in Assyrian I think the only thing I said was \u201cFuck you,\u201d just like over and over. I was like, \u201cJust go fuck yourself!\u201d \u2014 Oh, no, no, then I did say\u2026 She was like, \u201cWha wha\u2026\u201d I was like, \u201cYou <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">said these fucking people slipped!\u201d I said, \u201cAnd first of all, I contacted\u2026 the tenant was more worried about you.\u201d Nothing\u2026 there was no problem really, right. \u201cAnd second of all, regardless, I was concerned, not just for them but for you, because you\u2019re fucking old and you have your broken hip. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200373\">I put something, because you have to put something, right. Do you want to fucking fall? Or do you want to just be dirty for a second and fucking walk\u2026\u201d I mean, I just\u2026 I was shaking. Shaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">Came home, totally fucking sobbed, like just had a fucking breakdown. Then it was fine. My mom was\u2026 we had one little more. She kept trying to apologize and I blew her off for like a day, yelled at her a little more. But I was very articulate. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m done with you people.\u201d I was like, \u201cEverything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">is about you.\u201d You know. Like I was like, \u201cEverything is about you.\u201d Like I was like, \u201cEverything is about my fucking uncle, you.\u201d I was like, \u201cEver since my dad died you people have not\u2026 you think you\u2019ve looked out for me, but you haven\u2019t. And I\u2019m just fucking done with you. I love you. Yeah, I love <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200392\">you, I get it. Yeah, I get your\u2026\u201d You know. \u201cBut you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cYou cannot call me and then that kinda tone of\u2026 Who the fuck do you think you are?\u201d Yeah, so\u2026 And that was that. It\u2019s fine. I mean, it\u2019s cool. So that happened.

And she gets it now, whatever. And I\u2019m all, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">look, I love my uncle. It\u2019ll be fine at some point. But he needed a bitch slap. And if they can\u2019t get over it, that\u2019s their problem, not mine. I\u2019ll send them a note before I got to Assyrian or something, be like, \u201cHey, sorry it went down the way it did, but I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I tried to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">articulate it as best as I could, and you need to suck it up and accept that you\u2019re the man of the family. You can\u2019t put your mind with a lunatic sister and another sister who has a martyr complex. You gotta step up. You have the means, you have the language skills, and you claim to care so much about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">your mother.\u201d That\u2019s all that this is about. And I have to care for my grandmother and my mother. So, you know, really that\u2019s all there is to it.

I finished the blog post that I haven\u2019t published yet, but I\u2019m pretty happy with it. I\u2019m going to send it to you actually. But I\u2019m pretty happy with it. It just talks about why I\u2019m leaving and this and that. There\u2019s a part of me that like\u2026 I\u2019m just so angry, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">know what I mean, I\u2019m so disappointed and sad and angry. I just don\u2019t want it to come across as that. But I think it\u2019s\u2026 But then I\u2019m like, yeah, but you know what, I am fucking angry. What, I\u2019m supposed to write like that I\u2019m frolicking in a field? That\u2019s such an American\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">See, that\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving. You know what I mean? Like we\u2019re all supposed to be like, \u201cOh Claire, don\u2019t be so politically correct and so boring, just fucking have a beer.\u201d You know? No. There are things to be really fucking angry about. And I\u2019ve been like obsess\u2026 I mean, I\u2019ve been\u2026 I\u2019ve been I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">at that caf\u00e9, I shit you not, hours.

No, something has definitely shifted. Anyway, I think I have it to a place where it\u2019s angry, but it\u2019s thoughtful, and like factual, and, you know, just from the heart. And also like, look, I love it here, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m upset. And it also talks about my family. I finally was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">able to kind of have some paragraphs just saying that, you know, that\u2019s why: Immigrants take American principles really fucking seriously, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. But it\u2019s like this innocent\u2026 you know, then they get here and it\u2019s not exactly what they thought. But anyway, so I\u2019ve been writing a lot. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">The UConn thing, did I e-mail that to you?

My current\u2026 that younger guy I was telling you about, he\u2019s being very helpful, really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">good. Jason is being Jason.

I think you\u2019ll need to have two supervisors on site, as it were, to accelerate and complete for 2015.\u201d No problemo, all good. \u201cYou started with a poetry project and then shifted to a prose project\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t remember ever doing that, \u201c\u2026 which was not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">advancing very satisfactorily at the time you disappeared.\u201d That\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2026 I gotta be careful here, because my nerves are raw lately. But you can\u2019t tell me I disappeared, I don\u2019t like that. And the \u201cnot very satisfactorily,\u201d I\u2019ll let that slide I guess. But I don\u2019t even know what the fucking prose <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">project you\u2019re talking about. But disappeared? No. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether the poetry project or the prose project is what you are proceeding with. If the latter, there are several possibilities for supervisors at London. If the former\u2026\u201d blah, blah, blah. \u201cI will have a word,\u201d whoever that is, \u201cBest, Jason.\u201d [0:10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">So this is what I\u2019ve written back, but I think I need to send something like this: \u201cDear Jason, thanks for your note. I understand your situation and I\u2019m quite happy to work with Walter. I\u2019ll definitely be working on my initial poetry collection. I don\u2019t recall ever switching to a prose track. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">I need to address your choice of the word \u2018disappeared\u2019. Perhaps you meant nothing by it, but I find it a bit hurtful. Being at London, studying with you, and publishing are all things I\u2019ve been consistently thrilled about and committed to. I can\u2019t and won\u2019t apologize for not having the funds to stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">there, and for the fact that I\u2019ve had issues back home that have needed my attention. This is not for sympathy, but to remind you of the proper context.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">\u201cWhen I agreed to come to London I made it plain that I would need help with funding. I was told over a few e-mails that something would be arranged after my first year, but that never happened. And teaching a class there is not like teaching in the U.S., where it covers your tuition and provides a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">stipend. Still, because I\u2019m committed to finishing I found a way to make it back for the second year. I have accumulated debt for this degree, and that\u2019s fine, but I did not disappear. Lack of funds and personal matters back home should not be held against me. They have nothing to do with my talents <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">as a poet and ability to do a Ph.D. My second collection is nearly done and I\u2019m ready to finish the degree. I\u2019ll be lecturing at the university in Assyria, so I\u2019ll have time and resources to focus.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562564\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">\u201cThere have been many times that I\u2019ve e-mailed you to touch base, send poems, get some feedback, but I have generally not heard back or have gotten back somewhat curt replies. I know how busy you are so I have not taken it personally. But since you used the word \u2018disappeared\u2019, I felt a need to clarify. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">Forgive me if I\u2019ve misunderstood or overreacted.

But they\u2019re real. You know what I mean? When you do get to know them they\u2019re pretty amazing. I mean, I have amazing friends here, right. Once you cut through the ice a little bit. And if you don\u2019t want to, they leave you the fuck alone. It\u2019s kinda great. It\u2019s not San Francisco, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201991\">not like San Francisco, it\u2019s not\u2026 you know, it\u2019s just\u2026 And I found that to be very French too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">ANALYST: Then it gets\u2026 and being also about your\u2026 you\u2019re saying it\u2019s good for them, but at the same time that you\u2019re getting out of Darien.

I think in Assyrian, relatively quickly I think, I\u2019m gonna get like attention, I think I\u2019m gonna\u2014and this is just because people are telling me, that, you know, word is gonna quickly spread about this guy who\u2019s playing music, or this poet, or whatever, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">ANALYST: So it\u2019s a kind of identification with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie too, sort of the being\u2026 [0:36:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: I guess, yeah.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">ANALYST: And also the\u2014I know this is at a deeper level, because largely what you\u2019re describing sounds like such a positive casual feeling, but the\u2026 you know, the idea of in Darien they don\u2019t even notice you\u2019re there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562564\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

You know, they don\u2019t really lead to anything. Whereas over there I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D11\">they will lead to things. I\u2019m not even there yet and I\u2019m booking shows and I\u2019m, you know, in a place where no one does what I do. So the fact is, for the first time in my life I could be a working musician.
