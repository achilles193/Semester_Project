What do you...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I mean, I'm worried that it's going to take me a while to have enough clients to even pay the rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I mean, also it's real? I mean, once I drop that off now it's real, which is exciting. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, just I'm nervous. I mean, I think a lot of it's normal. But yeah, and my poor mom. She... it's been... it's just I'm so tired of these kinds of... everything's so dramatic with us sometimes. The poor woman, she sold some of her gold. She has a lot of gold jewelry, whatever. [0:01:57] She <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">sold some of it, just a couple pieces, so I could have three or four months' rent. It's just... that kills me, that we're in that kind of situation. And then now I feel even more... you know what I mean? If it doesn't work out, she's... she makes all these sacrifices. And it's all these dramatic kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">of gestures. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause) It's a lot of feeling that (inaudible at 0:02:33) to help out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then part of it too is that, I mean, this is... I'm doing something really... I'm almost in awe of my own (laughing)... I mean, this is ballsy, what I'm doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:02:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I mean, I'm just calling myself a life coach, getting a nice office, and setting up shop (laughing). It's kind of insane. But I also kind of feel... I mean, it's also exciting in the sense of, well, in the past this is what I've always not liked, is that I don't feel savvy. Or I don't feel savvy <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">in the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I look back, and I go, mother fucker. I could have just done this or I could have done... this feels very unsettling, because I think I'm being very savvy. I'm out there making... trying to make things happen and trying to figure out different... and it is a little... it's certainly risky. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">it's certainly a big leap. And it's all that shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: But I just have to stay focused and have faith that I've done my research and it's a viable business, this is a great area for people that are always trying to improve themselves...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: And that I can sell myself. I have to have faith that that's really what it is. [0:03:58] I'm building a brand. Come to this nice office, and talk to me. And I went to Brown, and I did these things. And I feel that I have these qualities that I can help you. (Chuckling) You're kind of selling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">yourself. That's all you're doing, actually. That's ballsy. That's a lot, especially for someone that has been so full of self-doubt (chuckling) for so long. It's kind of insane, so... (Pause) And in a way I don't know why there's not more of a voice saying, you shouldn't do this right now. You should <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B2\">wait and then rent it down the road when you can afford it, or I don't know what.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560560\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: But it's not.

I... so... and (pause) totally unrelated but related, of course Monday or Sunday, I think Monday, I had to call 911 for my grandmother. I was getting ready in the late morning. I hear ambulances, fire trucks, and they don't seem like they're driving by?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: So I look out the window, and I see they're outside. I go downstairs, and there are all these firemen and EMT guys in my mom's dining room. And I guess my grandmother had fainted. So that was another fucking trip to the ER.

My grandmother is... honestly, my mom, my uncle, and me, she had us in stitches laughing in the ER.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) [0:05:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I told my mom on the way home, I was like, Mom, you know what? Thank God... I mean, how cool that you have these... I mean, Grandpa, heart attack, open surgery, whatever. The guy died in his 90s. Her, they did an echocardiogram. Her heart's fine. Everything's fine. They think maybe just dehydration, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: It's like, what? Unbelievable. And then she's joking, she's trying to talk to the nurses. She's like, thank you, honey. She's petting their arms and stuff. And she's like, I go home now. It's like, I want to go home. (Laughing) She's like, okay, so let's... all right. Well, so let's take these <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">things off so we can go have coffee. And we're like, Grandma, you're in the hospital. You're sick in the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Why? We're like, you fainted. She's like, fainted? I never faint. Why did I faint? Then, I don't know, she said some fucking... she's... the lady that did the intake was this little chubby lady. [0:06:57] So she's talking, and my grandmother doesn't know what she's saying. And she' like, you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">going to stay. We have to keep you one night, blah blah blah. My grandmother's like, this is my daughter, my son, my daughter. She's pointing at me, she's like, my daughter's daughter. (Laughing) Doesn't know how... has forgotten how to say grandson. And then she's like... after the lady left, she just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B2\">laughed, and she goes, what did I say to that lady?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: It's just like, what the fuck?

And he's like, if she's okay, you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">saying she's okay, I'd rather just take her home.

But I guess it's been really bad lately. So it's been all this... the health stuff, which doesn't bode well for a time when I'm... I always get even more... at a major transitional time. So that's made me more... I've been feeling more anxious. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">I've been lightheaded kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Definitely trouble focusing. I'm just... I'm not sleeping that great because I just can't. A couple days I've been waking up completely just not feeling good. [0:08:57] My mind... I feel completely overwhelmed, my mind's racing, tightness. So then that makes me think of my dad, blah blah blah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">But the good thing, though, is, I started stopping that a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I was like, you know what? Wait a minute. I'm not my fucking dad. You know what I mean? My dad had no options, had no education, had a bum arm, didn't know English that great. I mean, I was like, what's the comparison? Stress?

And that's supposed to be how it happens when it's going to go well. It's a much longer term (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Right, you've got to be able to stick it out for at least a year and keep plugging away and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because even if... with life coaching you could get... say you start getting referrals.

Why do anything if so much of your life has been spent preoccupied with trying to get things going well? Right? That's been the drive. Get it better, get it healthier.

I'm just kind of letting go of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: Another good thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">CLIENT: He's awesome. Fucking awesome interview on YouTube from 1970, I don't know when.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">CLIENT: But he said something that was so right on. He said that he... (Pause) From a young age, he was both fascinated and in fear, terror, because of the particular of... what does he call it? [0:25:03] The particular of the universal or something like that. But just that one day when he was young <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201931\">he just had this bombshell realization that nothing is the same, that no leaf is the same, no...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: Even blades of grass are kind of different, and that he will never, ever, ever be able to experience all those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: He'll never see every beautiful landscape. He'll never go to every awesome museum. He'll never meet every beautiful woman, or whatever it is. And he said that, for a long time, that was a hindrance. So he would start making... I mean, in a way I think I've been like that. He would make lists. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B1\">He would in other words try to inventory everything and try to... and then, when he got a little bit older, he said now his consolation... he thinks about future generations. [0:26:02] He thinks, okay, well, I won't be able to read every book. But the beauty of it is that, whatever that book is in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B2\">library that I think about... that, oh, there's books in the library that I haven't discovered yet. He's like, well, someday someone else is going to discover those books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: And he's like, that's kind of the beautiful thing. He was like, that's my consolation. He's like, that. So I thought that was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: And it also takes away the beauty. If you could see it all, then it's finite. It's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Well, that's the thing. You know it's not finite. So it just makes you chase after something that can never be, you know what I mean? So you waste your energy kind of. [0:26:57] But yeah, I thought that was really... I think a lot of artists have that... that's their <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A31\">problem and their... part of their talent at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: That's why you have things to say or images or metaphors, because you notice how unique and unusual everything is. But it also... I mean, I feel that way at Widener all the time. I'll be... I'm just... it almost causes anxiety. It's just, I'm so, what are these fucking books? I mean, who's reading <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A71\">these? It's just ridiculous. But then I see other people in there just doing their thing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: And it's just like I... yeah, you have to not let it go, but you have to be like, yeah, that's cool. Yeah, I don't know what that book is. But someone someday is going to come here and take that book out (pause), just like I did. I mean, a lot of stuff I was taking out of the library hadn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB1\">been checked out in years.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560560\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Hmm. [0:27:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: And I used to love... it's 1978 or whatever, when she would stamp the book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: That's insane! Or never been checked out. It's like, what the fuck? But yeah, it's like, why would they? I mean, this is a bazillion books in there, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT: I don't know. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">THERAPIST: We're talking about... you're talking about the existential, about the external. But I also think it's sort of relates back to who... how you could feel about yourself in your own skin as a person, and that that's part of where people can relax into just leading a life, their own life, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B91\">the best that they can...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Is if you know there's no one else in the world who is you, and never will be, never was and never will be another you. And it's not being king, it's not being pope, it's not being the most famous author in the United States contemporarily. But it is something special.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [0:29:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">THERAPIST: And I think there's a way... or to... the you that started to be as a young child did not feel uniquely, exquisitely known and special for who he was to your mom...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely not, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Where (ph) you're loved just for you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Not because you're the best or the most this or the least that, just... it's you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, no, definitely not, yeah. And it turns out they didn't feel those things either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Towards themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So they didn't have any of that to give.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">CLIENT: No reference point to know how to do that, yeah. Except for my grandmother. (Chuckling) But for some reason none of them became like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Hmm. [0:29:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:31:00] Yeah, it's funny. The way I've been feeling lately is like that whole metaphor of waking up from a coma. [0:31:58] It's kind of like, now, it's as if I can't even... (Pause) I'm having a lot of moments where I cannot focus my thought, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">CLIENT: Because it does kind of feel like a discombobulated dude (chuckling) that just got... woke up, just like, what is happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">CLIENT: So that's... it's a little disconcerting a little bit. I was just sitting. I was like, what am I thinking about right now? And I... it was literally a million things at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">CLIENT: I couldn't... you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">CLIENT: I could pick out maybe five (chuckling), but it's like, oh man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">THERAPIST: So it's not an absence of finding things that you're thinking (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">CLIENT: No, I was thinking about the books I'm writing, this business, and my mom and grandmother getting older, whatever, that, and... (Pause) [0:32:58] I don't... and nothing bad really. It's just a lot. It's just a lot of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

[0:35:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">THERAPIST: Collegial (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.

They don't report that shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20255\">THERAPIST: I don't know. I don't know (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20257\">CLIENT: I don't know either.

But I don't think they do. Otherwise way more people would have fucked up...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025F\">CLIENT: I mean, if you're...

But whatever. [0:42:58] I'm just going to... just I'll feel better if I just let them know that, look, this is what happened.
