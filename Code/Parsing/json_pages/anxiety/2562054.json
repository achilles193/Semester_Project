It\u2019s going to be like one person at a time, so each of them have to come out and learn from me, about our biometrics, our signature <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">kind of data analysis, and kind of learn more about kind of work we\u2019ve done within that, because it\u2019s a six-year project, like when I was in school I worked on that, what has been done. Because (sighs) I guess I spent a lot of time on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just not really like\u2026 looking forward to that, but, but I don\u2019t know, I imagine that this is going to affect coming here, like the scheduling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Because, until I know more of when exactly they\u2019re coming, I can let you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, we\u2019ll see. I notice I\u2019ve been thinking like, I don\u2019t know, like I think I want to start not coming as much because I need more time for work. And I don\u2019t know, I think it causes me a lot of anxiety that I can\u2019t get up and immediately go to work and ah, I can\u2019t deal with things that pop <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">up with it. So I guess I would like to come twice a week, instead of four times. I know, like I don\u2019t know, it makes no defense on how much I\u2019m paying but I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not just a timing thing, I mean I don\u2019t know, kind of more time to work. (long pause) So what do you think? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know yet. (pause) Yeah, I\u2019m not sure yet, what to say. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So, yeah, I mean\u2026 (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You seem surprised or something that I don\u2019t have kind of an immediate response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know if you want me to explain myself or\u2026 (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (long pause) I guess I can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s your sense that like I\u2019m sort of feeling in the dark and need more of an explanation, I\u2019m going to disagree and so, you know, need to know what your reasons are, or you may be frustrated, so that you need to sort of placate me with an explanation, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">or something else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: (long pause) I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, mad, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t better explain myself or just deal with it. (sounds upset; sad) Or I don\u2019t know, I shouldn\u2019t feel so guilty for wanting\u2026 more time than that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: You feel like you\u2019re doing two things wrong? (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I guess so. (long pause) I guess I just don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s hard or almost like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Is that why you\u2019re so affected?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I can\u2019t imagine that (pause) feeling like you\u2019re doing something wrong by wanting more time is part of what makes it hard to explain yourself, like you sort of or imagine what makes the prospect of explaining yourself so overwhelming. (pause) I guess I imagine you feel as though I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">also to see you as being wrong for what we haven\u2019t even got started. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I guess, I\u2019m not really sure. (sighs) (long pause) I think I just feel, I don\u2019t know, guilty or I don\u2019t know, (soft, sad voice) like worn out because I\u2019m making a change. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562054\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you\u2019re also feeling like this, and I have disappointed you, let you down, and I just heard why you don\u2019t want to come as often and that feels like you are sort of rejecting or pushing me away and you feel bad. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not that I might feel guilty because, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the message that I\u2019m giving off, but I don\u2019t want you to feel that way. I just, I don\u2019t know. (long pause) I guess I just feel a lot of anxiety and pressure when I wake up and I need to deal with it or I need to\u2026 (sighs) I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">to get off until later, it just makes things worse. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Would being able to come in earlier make any difference, or that doesn\u2019t really matter, it\u2019s more just the time it takes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean, I think it\u2019s just because almost every day of the week, the workweek, and that I can have this\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I guess I just, I don\u2019t know I just think four times a week, that\u2019s hard for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">[PAUSE: 00:24:23 to 00:27:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so a lot of it is delay and the time away from being able to get to your work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: And that, in terms of a lot of the things that we talked about, makes you feel more anxious and overwhelmed, kind of under the gun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">[PAUSE: 00:27:48 to 00:29:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m just not sure what to do, because\u2026 (pause) I feel like I was kind of giving it a try, like I don\u2019t know. All last year, I don\u2019t know, most things that are on my mind are or doing work, just those things, and I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I know it sounds like counterintuitive, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">I feel like if I could just get there and kind of deal with it right away, it wouldn\u2019t I don\u2019t know. It goes either way. It wouldn\u2019t bother me so much or I don\u2019t know, easier to deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">[PAUSE: 00:32:31 to 00:33:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I think in a way, it seems sort of you\u2019re saying that ironically, coming here four times a week, like exacerbates one of the main problems you\u2019re coming in to deal with in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right.

That the only way you can feel safer from the anxiety that you\u2019re talking about is to be in there doing the work, that what we\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t, at least so far, protect you very well <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">from that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Right? I mean\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I just go to the no brain. I know myself. I know that I\u2019m super productive in the morning. I like to get up early and to do things. I hate putting things off. I hate not dealing with things and not having an answer or feeling, I don\u2019t know, accomplished. So, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">is like, I don\u2019t know\u2026 (pause) I don\u2019t know, I feel like I need to I mean, I shouldn\u2019t view that as something bad or something I need to work on or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Or, I don\u2019t know what. (chokes up) Or like, I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t make it worse or\u2026 (sniffles) I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess this does remind me a little bit of yesterday in that (pause) It seems to me you\u2019re again, perhaps, tell me if I\u2019m wrong, saying there\u2019s a conflict between you and me in that (pause) I think you put it just as though I see this as something bad and that you need to work on. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">Which\u2026 I guess I feel like slightly, something that the anxiety just kind of eats away at you and the only way to deal with it is sort of go in and sort of start getting stuff done soon. I guess that, it seems to me, to put it in a sort negative way, quite different from, you know, you just like to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">get work done in the morning, you\u2019re really productive then and\u2026 (pause) Well, I don\u2019t notice I\u2019m talking, it seems to me like (inaudible).
