(pause 00:00:12 00:00:17) (inaudible)\u2014I\u2019m having a not great week. I guess I\u2019m continuing to have a not great week and weekend. (pause 00:00:27 00:00:31) This weekend I was feeling like very\u2014I just feeling like isolated from my friends. So I called Jamie to see how she was doing. (pause <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">00:00:45 00:00:50) Which turned into\u2014it was like half a good conversation and half super frustrating. So Jamie is now the doctor and doing her residency. And so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Is she up here or is she\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: She\u2019s in Utah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Okay. That\u2019s right. You mentioned that I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019ve had to tell her before like, \u201cYou\u2019re not my doctor.\u201d So I like if I call and talk to you about medical stuff\u2014or just like I feel (inaudible) like I don\u2019t, you know. (pause 00:01:27 00:01:32) And so I was just (inaudible) just kind of like anything that she\u2019d be like, \u201cOh.\u201d Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">again, I\u2019d say like, \u201cI fell and had to get stitches.\u201d \u201cHow many? What kind? Did they use a suture?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. They doctor did things.\u201d But I was\u2014she had been feeling really depressed and overwhelmed during her residency and was really worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to finish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yes. Now I remember we talked about her once I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: (cross talk) was pretty overwhelming for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, you know, I wanted to see how that was going. She got a dog. Or adopted a dog to kind of help with feeling depressed. So, like first we just talked about like pets in a nice, you know, crazy pet owner way. (pause 00:02:26 00:02:32) So then I tried\u2014it was\u2014I was trying to talk to her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">about how I felt and that I just like that\u2014I really wasn\u2019t feeling good and I haven\u2019t been feeling very good mentally. In that like I\u2019m getting super frustrated because I\u2019m just like I feel horrible and felt horrible for a very long time. And I would like it to stop or get better. (pause 00:02:56 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">00:03:02) And even though I tried Cymbalta and was off Cymbalta.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And her first response is, \u201cWhy Cymbalta instead of something something?\u201d And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014like a, I don\u2019t what that other drug is and b, my psychiatrist and I talked about it.\u201d (pause 00:03:18 \u2013 00:03:24) And that was just like not\u2014it was kind of the opposite of how I wanted her to respond. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">(pause 00:03:31 00:03:36) And she really wanted to talk about (pause 00:03:41 00:03:47) my medication which I didn\u2019t want to. Like that wasn\u2019t why I called. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, yeah. You need two weeks to be feeling (inaudible).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: A consult?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I was like, \u201cNo. It\u2019s not really going to be that way.\u201d But like I know that I will not feel better in two weeks of increased (inaudible) her, but not if I increase Lexapro. But it was really frustrating. And so I ended the conversation by saying, \u201cI had to cook dinner.\u201d And it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">part of why I was so frustrated. Like not only is she not my doctor and I wasn\u2019t calling for a consult, I had been taking psychiatric medicine longer than she\u2019s been in medical school. (laughter) Like yeah. And I think right now is the first time she\u2019s I think probably (inaudible) voluntarily. So like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">you know, like one of us has more experience and also she\u2019s not my doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562394\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see. But I guess there\u2019s two things though. Like one of them is not her role. And the other is it\u2019s really presumptuous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I mean like it would have been different I guess if you had been\u2014new medication. She had been\u2014you know she\u2019s a 55-year-old psychiatrist who had been practicing for 20 years or something. And like you had been complaining about a side effect and she made a comment. Like that still might not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">be what you wanted from her, but it wouldn\u2019t be presumptuous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. Yes. I talked to her I think about Lexapro and (inaudible) interaction. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, yeah. That,\u201d\u2014I\u2019m like, \u201cYep. I found out about that the crappy way.\u201d And so we talked about that briefly. But yeah. It was just sort of like I\u2014this is really like I don\u2019t want to insult you but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">like you just started this. And I get that medical school is a lot of things and blah, blah, blah, but you just started and you\u2019re not my doctor. And you don\u2019t know everything I\u2019m taking. And still not my doctor. And then she lectured me on drinking and smoking pot. Which was weird in a lot of ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">because I\u2019m not really drinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I didn\u2019t ask about it and I have zero interest in discussing like THC and cannabinoids. I just don\u2019t care. (laughter) Yeah. And I could not get her off that. So, that didn\u2019t really help. Like I felt less isolated, but I didn\u2019t feel any better which sucked. And also Ashby commented that\u2014like we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">sitting (inaudible) and she asked me several times. Like, \u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d And I finally said like, \u201cDo I seem worse?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYes. You seem extra crazy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: This is after talking to Jamie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Before talking to her. Like one of the reasons why I decided to call her is I was like, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m being extra, extra crazy, this would be an even better good time to call.\u201d (pause 00:07:39 \u2013 00:07:43) And I also hate to feel like I\u2019m imposing on Ashby. (pause 00:07:53 00:07:59) But on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">the other hand, I\u2019d like\u2014I have a hard time. Like we were\u2014I mean I was having a hard time following PD, having a hard time breathing, or just like concentrating on following anything which is super like not normal. (pause 00:08:19 00:08:23) And she wanted to marathon a TV show and I was just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">\u201cI can\u2019t concentrate,\u201d but I\u2019ll just lie here on the sofa for awhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Just so I\u2019m clear that\u2014that I\u2019m not yet sure what to say about it. I get it. (inaudible) thinking of it about you are like feeling worse. Or (inaudible). (pause 00:09:06 00:09:11) Without, I mean, you know, some of it was related to trying the Cymbalta. (pause 00:09:18 00:09:28) I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">we haven\u2019t talked much as that. There are other bad things that are going on, but (pause 00:09:33 \u2013 00:09:37) like this other work doesn\u2019t (inaudible) bad. But it\u2019s not necessarily worse than some other things that have happened at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I think that\u2019s part of why I\u2019m just sort of sitting here feeling frustrated is that I feel like the Cymbalta didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. Well, that\u2019s like whatever time.\u201d And I feel like\u2014so now I\u2019m up to the amount of Lexapro that she wants me to be taking. And I think it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">one last week of Cymbalta to taper off it. And\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562394\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Is Lexapro what you were on before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Lexapro and Wellbutrin. And I\u2019ve stayed on Wellbutrin the whole time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m sorry. Why did you switch? I forget whether it was you were feeling worse or was it a side effect that led her to (cross talk) you switch to Cymbalta.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: I was feeling worse and I was crying periodically. Just like suddenly weepy. (pause 00:10:54 \u2013 00:10:59) Although no one when (inaudible), so I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: You mean like as you had on Cymbalta. That week after we met.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Week beginning after we met. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s very like I\u2019m seeing Dr. Gerrard (ph) in I think a week or so. Beginning of April. And I talked to her about this. I was like, \u201cI just feel really crappy.\u201d And she was of the opinion that it\u2019s sort of in between anything working. Like the Cymbalta is down. (inaudible) up enough to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">kick in. Which like I\u2019m willing to go with that for a little bit. But not much longer. Like I really am done. Or like not (inaudible) but like I just feel miserable and I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything that is helping right now. (pause 00:12:13 \u2013 00:12:19) And for me at least to add to the frustration <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">is the things that I normally do to distract myself I\u2019m just having a really hard time doing. (pause 00:12:31 \u2013 00:12:38) Like I was at a (inaudible) yesterday. Which was like (inaudible). And I was like, \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d But it was weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">I had a really hard time following the directions. Like, you know, I\u2019d have to ask her to repeat. And I\u2019m just like, \u201cOh.\u201d And I just felt like just\u2014I don\u2019t know. Like clumsy and slow and like just sort of like I know I know how to do this. Like why can\u2019t I do this? And I felt the same way like when <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">I was trying to sew\u2014I was trying to like sew quilt squares or something. And I was just like, \u201cUgh.\u201d This is a straight seam. I know how to sew that. This shouldn\u2019t be hard. It should be nice little doh, doh, doh, doh, doh. And then with having like TV and books aren\u2019t really working either. I\u2019m just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">like, \u201cOkay. Well, what do I do?\u201d Like, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">And the other thing which was\u2014is super frustrating work thing but not actually about work. So, Chet\u2019s gone for two weeks which is great. It\u2019s Cambridge spring break right now which is nice. So, I decide to get myself set up with (inaudible) and do some brainstorming for a couple things. And like Monday <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">I just really barely made it through the day. I just kind of sat at my desk and like, \u201cI feel really upset. I can\u2019t concentrate. I cannot go home right now.\u201d But I also probably can sit here and not like waste vacation time. And I want to go to this class anyway. And I just could not\u2014like I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">do the simple thing of like, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s try running some words on a white board.\u201d And I tried to do that again today. And it really didn\u2019t work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">And (pause 00:15:03 \u2013 00:15:07) I ended up getting really frustrated\u2014it would be at work. A, because we had this\u2014another horrible staff meeting. And Karl was explaining how\u2014one of his new visions for whatever. And he was just\u2014and I had asked what staff space was (inaudible) there going to be any\u2014an <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">expansion of that?\u201d And so he kind of muttered various things and he\u2019s like, \u201cWell,\u201d\u2014he started making commenting. He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, there\u2019s really nowhere else to go.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I could go back to my old office space.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, no. No. We can\u2019t do that. I mean when people were just crammed <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">in there. I don\u2019t know if you\u2014if you were aware then.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah. I sat there for like four to five years.\u201d I was aware of it. And he said, \u201cThis is just so terrible,\u201d and blah, blah. I\u2019m like, \u201cUgh.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562394\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">Like it was weird because he was telling me how horrible it was. And how they wanted to use it for something else, but they couldn\u2019t. And finally I was like, \u201cI really liked it. I had more work space. I could think. It was great.\u201d And he\u2014like just kept on talking like I hadn\u2019t said anything. Which that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">did almost send me\u2014made me burst in tears. But I managed not to. (pause 00:16:34 \u2013 00:16:38) Mostly because these changes probably aren\u2019t going to happen for another year or so. So, hey. I may not be here which (pause 00:16:45 00:16:50) is also like (pause 00:16:51 00:17:00)\u2014so (inaudible) headed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">the concept of Cambridge. I would have kind of liked my\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re head of the concept?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Yes. The concept is it\u2019s not a Cambridge system or Cambridge. There\u2019s Cambridge. So conceptually all of the schools are actually just one school. Yeah. As I said, it\u2019s conceptual. (laughter) It\u2019s very conceptual. It\u2019s (inaudible) they talk about Cambridge. I\u2019m just like, \u201cWhat?\u201d So she\u2019s doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">that. So she\u2019s part of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: The head of that is something you liked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like they hired (inaudible) first. And I was like, \u201cOh, she didn\u2019t seem to be an idiot.\u201d I kind of tended to (inaudible) her. I don\u2019t want to throw up with stress when I talk to her. And they\u2019re hiring for new positions. And everyone they\u2019re interviewing for (inaudible) is white again. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">And she kind of set up this like\u2014her office sent out an e-mail about like, you know, what are some things that you think about the new Cambridge that would be helpful? And also sent out e-mail about you can nominate coworkers or other people for an award. Like people who did really\u2014and so they listed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">like six things. And one of them was promoted diversity in the work place. And I was just like mm-mmm. Like (pause 00:18:47 00:18:51) that line just made me really (pause 00:18:54 00:19:00)\u2014I don\u2019t know. Like it kind of crystallized like all my frustrations at that moment when I was at my e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">And so I really just wanted to write to the new head of the Cambridge school and say like, \u201cThe thing that the most difficult at work is that you just keep on hiring white people. Could you please stop that? Thanks.\u201d (pause 00:19:22 00:19:26) But I don\u2019t think I actually want to do that. Like for\u2014like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">you know, I do and I don\u2019t. (pause 00:19:31 00:19:38) And trying to write was\u2014made me want to cry. Not writing it made me want to cry. (pause 00:19:42 00:19:47) And I kind of thought today was going to be a great week because Chet\u2019s not here. But as it turned out staring at his desk is also\u2014is just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">irritating or stressful or something. And I just feel so mentally crappy that, you know, like I guess I can\u2019t really enjoy the benefits of not having him around. Whatever that might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: (pause 00:20:15 00:21:39) And that sort of was approximately because (inaudible) was stressful?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562394\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: (pause 00:21:44 \u2013 00:21:48) It\u2019s a couple of things like (pause 00:21:51 00:21:58) on Monday no one is in the office except for me and a student worker. And I realized that like I actually also just hate the office space. Like it\u2019s cramped. I feel like I never (inaudible) anything. And I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">dislike\u2014just like\u2014I don\u2019t know. Like there\u2019s not enough room for anything, so in order for me to try to use the (inaudible) into this cube. Which also reminds me like I can\u2019t get in\u2014I can\u2019t wheel a chair\u2014my own chair in and out of my cube. I have to lift it because the passageway is so narrow. Yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">And I also can\u2019t use my white board because walking in and out of my cube erases it because it\u2019s so narrow. And I hate it.

(pause 00:23:26 00:23:31) And I think I am going to just say fuck it and like go work among the student spaces. Get away from everyone. (pause <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">00:23:41 00:23:49) But also like I feel like I\u2019m still (pause 00:23:51 00:24:05)\u2014I guess it\u2019s like one of the things is also just Chet\u2019s lack of\u2014I don\u2019t know. Like common courtesy, politeness, whatever. Somebody told me about is to (inaudible) vacation the day before he left. And I was like, \u201cOh.

I\u2019m going (inaudible).\u201d And I was just sort of like, \u201cBut how do you disappear for two weeks <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">and not tell me?\u201d Like I work right here. Allegedly, you supervise me in some weird way. And then he also hadn\u2019t told his\u2014any of his student works. So, after telling me, I was just sort of staring at him frankly. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I have to remember to e-mail the students that they shouldn\u2019t try to text <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">me or e-mail me because I\u2019ll be out of the country.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">And I was like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Like I hope they have something to do.

Like I\u2019ve\u2014I don\u2019t know. Like everywhere I\u2019ve worked, I\u2019ve kind of let <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">people know.

(pause 00:32:39 00:32:48) I just\u2014it\u2019s very weird for\u2014I don\u2019t know. Like it felt weird to\u2014like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200832\">to be asked if I had been promoted. I\u2019m like, \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d I\u2019m actually doing this because it\u2019s a huge vacuum.

Like in the last two weeks, there was a change and now I can\u2019t\u2014if someone calls the main IT desk, there\u2019s no way for me to find out. Like it used to be I could look in the (inaudible) system. And they changed and I don\u2019t have access to it.

I\u2019m not sure how I can do IT work if I can\u2019t see anything.\u201d And like one of the people who answers the phone (inaudible) is really rude and abrasive and can\u2019t remember my name or what I do.

Like I can\u2019t get around him by looking into system myself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">I can\u2019t like, you know? I\u2019m just sort of like\u2014and I get\u2014I also\u2014like I just don\u2019t understand how anyone could think that I have any more authority or any anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Like (00:36:01 00:36:06) we keep on getting these like weird like party line slogans like the single Cambridge. Everyone goes, \u201cWhat?\u201d And it\u2019s not really explained. And you\u2019re just like, \u201cOkay. I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d We\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">doing modalities which Karl couldn\u2019t explain what he meant by that. (pause 00:36:29 00:36:44) And I think\u2014I mean the other thing is (pause 00:36:46 00:36:52) part of like my frustration and feeling like I don\u2019t have any power is that Chet isn\u2019t backing up on anything. And I\u2019m not part of the IT department.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">So they don\u2019t like\u2014they don\u2019t care about what I\u2019m doing.
