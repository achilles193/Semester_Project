Doing my best, man. It\u2019s this money thing is really like starting to like literally make me feel sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: What did you end up doing this weekend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I did go to the wedding, which I felt good about. It\u2019s like when it rains, it pours. And I felt good about it. Everything I was like whatever. And then the night, then Saturday night, I was like crashing on the couch. Everything was really fun. Checked my e-mail. Just when your brain\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">overloaded you I just I didn\u2019t think, I didn\u2019t stop to think, for a second. It literally didn\u2019t cross my mind that when I paid these fuckers their deposit, right, for the office, then I paid a prorated September rate, right. [00:01:08.21] So that was like so right there that was over $500, right. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">For some reason, I mean just beyond naive or beyond just your mind being so cluttered you can\u2019t think straight, I was like oh, good, I\u2019m done til October. It doesn\u2019t even I was like yeah, but when are you going to pay for October, right. For some reason so I opened my e-mail, and of course there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">was an invoice for the rent that\u2019s due today. So it\u2019s just yeah, just not good. I\u2019m not doing good. I\u2019m trying to like stay and then like we had a great show that we were supposed to have last night at the bar. Guitar player cut his finger like super bad, had to cancel that. [00:02:04.01] This is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">like I\u2019m definitely worn down. I\u2019m definitely like in a situational depression right now. There\u2019s no I mean I\u2019m like sleeping all day. I don\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m just I\u2019m in a bad way right now. Constantly like in physical distress. I\u2019m tight. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. Or like heartburn or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">Like I just I don\u2019t feel well. I can\u2019t stop my mind from racing. I obviously can\u2019t think straight, right. And then of course and now I\u2019m just trying to shore up against like of course then it\u2019s like you\u2019re an idiot. You shouldn\u2019t have rented this place. You have no prospects of getting any clients <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">any time soon. What are you doing. [00:03:01.10] So I\u2019m trying not to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I\u2019m trying not to go there. However, I\u2019m also trying I am trying to be practical. I mean I don\u2019t have any fucking clients, and I don\u2019t have any prospect of getting clients. So I don\u2019t know man. I\u2019m just very frustrated, very, very frustrated. And now my poor mom of course <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">went again sold more of her fucking jewelry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: For your rent you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, the thing is like that\u2019s not enough. Because I didn\u2019t have the heart to oh, that was the other thing. They also, in the same week, so I got the thing for the but they also deposited the deposit check. That was deposited like this week or something. I mean I again, my own fault. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">should\u2019ve tracked like why isn\u2019t that being deposited or what\u2019s going on. [00:04:00.27] I didn\u2019t even have the heart to tell my mom that because that fucked me, right. That\u2019s $400 almost that I had that I thought okay, then $400 plus even if this had happened, like I would\u2019ve been able to somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">like this would\u2019ve been enough. My mom gave me like $400. I would\u2019ve but I couldn\u2019t I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that they also I didn\u2019t keep track and they fucking deposited the deposit. I\u2019m just oh man.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It does sound like your expenses are more than you have coming in. So it\u2019s going to be really stressful until you can somehow break even a little bit right now. And does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Does what well yeah. I mean and I knew that was going to be the case. It\u2019s just I mean this month in a deposit check, then the rent for September, and now it\u2019s September 25, the rent for I mean this month. My car, that incident with my car. [00:05:06.18] I mean it\u2019s just out of control. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">It\u2019s this and now I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve got to tell this poor woman, not poor woman, I\u2019m the poor person, but I\u2019ve got to tell her that look, I mean what am I supposed to do now if I give her the rent now that my mom then I\u2019m fucked because I\u2019ve also I had it all planned out this week. I\u2019ve got to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">pay a credit card. I\u2019ve got there are a couple of things, here, whatever. You know what I mean? Now I\u2019m fucked. If I pay her right now I would literally have like $25.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You have to get more money somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I sent out [ph] my mom\u2019s like mom, this these things aren\u2019t going to work. I can\u2019t come to you and you help me in these little it\u2019s frustrating for me. It\u2019s frustrating for you. And also this is not the way to start a I can\u2019t you can\u2019t ask me how the business is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">when I have no capital whatsoever to do anything. [00:06:06.00] I can\u2019t advertise properly. What am I supposed to do, just be on Facebook all day trying to get clients? I mean I can\u2019t, let\u2019s say, hire someone, some Emerson marketing student or something, to like you know what I mean? I can\u2019t do anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">to really properly advertise, like make like even make like really nice postcards and put them at Starbucks all over town. Or whatever. I mean like every little thing is a little bit of money. LinkedIn, for example. Yeah, it\u2019s free, but if you want to get a little more out of it, you\u2019ve got to pay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">I\u2019ve been weighing whether that\u2019s worth it or not, but everything I\u2019ve read seems like it kind of is worth it to pay. Well, all right, that\u2019s like $30 a month or some shit like that. All these little things are money. Like I\u2019m not starting one of those businesses where I need like $100,000. But I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">access to a buffer, a cushion. [00:07:02.20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a hard business to start without any cash flow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any business that you can start without what business can you start? Even the tutoring. Like yeah, I once I get that going, of course it could be much faster than life coaching to make some but guess what. How? Like just putting it on craigslist? That doesn\u2019t work <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">anymore because you know what? There are lots of fucking douches on there tutoring for $15 an hour. So I need the capital to make nice postcards and make a nice website and kind of build it up to be something that\u2019s worth $60 an hour. You know what I mean? How do those fuckers all charge $150 a hour, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">$100, for tutoring? It\u2019s because they have this like prepared marketing collateral and a nice website that looks really snazzy. I mean I made myself I did it again. I made like a website for the tutoring. [00:08:00.29] Yeah, it\u2019s all right, but you know what I mean? Like these little things take money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">It\u2019s not even a little that\u2019s the insane thing. It\u2019s not a lot of money. So she\u2019s going to talk to my uncle again. And I didn\u2019t want her to do that but I don\u2019t I literally don\u2019t know what else to do. I don\u2019t hear back from any jobs. Or I just get turned down. I mean this is I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s an apocalyptic feeling, but between that and everything going on in the world, it\u2019s just not good. It\u2019s not good. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: Is this feeling familiar? I know it\u2019s so clearly about the present and money, but does that [ph] apocalyptic...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: No, no, no. Not so much. No. [00:09:09.17] I mean the parts that are true are more the hypochondria a little bit. And the crushing like aloneness. That feels pretty familiar. But this level of being broke and panicked about being broke, I don\u2019t maybe I was so much in a fog when I was younger. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">And also school, school was always like well, I\u2019m in you know what I mean? There was and you\u2019re younger. I mean let\u2019s face it. That\u2019s it\u2019s scaring the shit out of me. I\u2019m like what the fuck. This is it, kind of. Like this is the part of my life where I try to establish something in terms of revenue. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">Forget about art and all that, just money. And it\u2019s horrifying, especially, again, when everything you read or listen to old people. Just now on NPR, a 75 year old guy working 3 part time jobs. Sounded very smart, intelligent dude. [00:10:02.24] I mean this is people going into malls just killing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200293\">people left and right and like something\u2019s not things are not good. And I\u2019m trying also to not feel like things are going to get worse because I feel like they are. I just feel like things are unhinged. I feel like we\u2019re beyond the tipping point economically. It\u2019s just haves or have nots. You either <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200294\">have it or you don\u2019t, and if I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll make some kind of living, but unless I really really kind of all pistons start working at the same time and timing is right and this is right, maybe I\u2019ll do even better than just making a living. But like I\u2019m really starting to feel like everywhere you turn <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200295\">things are stacked against people who are not rich anymore. It\u2019s not even about making like $100,000. I mean people who are making $100,000 are struggling. So it\u2019s like what the fuck are the rest of us supposed to feel like? [00:11:03.11] I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your mom going to ask your uncle for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: I told her that I was like I don\u2019t want money from him. I feel like it would be so I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying not to be a simpleton, but I mean I\u2019m sorry, he\u2019s doing really well. I mean I know he has problems, I know but revenue wise they\u2019re doing really, really well. It would just take <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">one fucking signature to help us get our home equity line. So that\u2019s what I I was like that way first of all and also, we can pay him. I was like Mom, I don\u2019t want him to come here and have him fix our roof. We\u2019ve got fucking equity. We\u2019re already paying them one way or the other the mortgage <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">is getting paid. If you draw from the equity line your mortgage isn\u2019t going to go up hundreds of dollars. It goes up it\u2019s like a credit card. I mean they add incremental thing every month. [00:12:05.01] Well that\u2019s going to get paid. And you know what? I\u2019m not a moron, she\u2019s not a moron. I mean we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D3\">I know things are going to be okay. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this. You know what I mean? So I was like I don\u2019t want him to just give us $10,000 or something. I don\u2019t want that anymore. He\u2019s already he\u2019s done things like that for us. And it is a big deal for him to sign. It\u2019s a huge deal. But you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D4\">know what? We\u2019re family, and I would do that for him or because literally otherwise I need to start asking my few like Assyrian those friends of mine, I need to ask them I need to take them up on their offer to like help me with a few hundred dollars here, a few I mean I don\u2019t want to fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D5\">do that. The opposite. I want to pay George. There are people I want to here. I\u2019m sick of this shit. And I said if you don\u2019t, then I have to like take my hat in my hand and kind of ask my friends to sign this equity thing that that one friend I asked already, clearly he doesn\u2019t want to do it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D6\">he hasn\u2019t really followed up with talking to me, so and now I feel bad. [00:13:11.27] I didn\u2019t want to put him on the spot. I didn\u2019t don\u2019t want to make him feel uncomfortable, so it\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: So you told your mom that that seemed like it make more sense than just money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: It\u2019s literally the oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s not just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: She\u2019ll go [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: It\u2019s literally kind of the only real option there is right now, unless she wants to keep asking my uncle for little it\u2019s almost like a chain now. It\u2019s become like a chain. My mom helps me with little things that mean nothing, in terms of really building things up. And the same with my uncle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re just plugging holes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. We\u2019re just plugging holes. And also it\u2019s just causing stress. My uncle probably feels a little uncomfortable. He\u2019s doing it but whereas this way it\u2019s like no, dude, now it\u2019s our responsibility. [00:14:01.07] It\u2019s our money, first of all. And second of all, now we can pay you; we can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">pay you back. We can do things ourselves. We don\u2019t need you know what I mean? I have no doubt that I could probably have tutoring students within a week or two. That\u2019s like pretty fast. It\u2019s just got to be done the right way. Because again, things have changed. There\u2019s a million desperate people who <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">are you go on craigslist, forget it. Who\u2019s going to why? Why should they pay me $60 like on craigslist, craigslist just kind of waters everything down. Why the fuck am I going to pay this guy $60, $70 an hour, even $50 an hour, when this Harvard student wants $15 an hour to pay for his weekend <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200393\">drinking. I mean that\u2019s times have really, really gotten tough that way. So and I can\u2019t I\u2019m not going to give away my services for free. I\u2019m not going to do that. I mean I\u2019ve got to $60 is even a little bit tutoring, even small tutoring companies charge like $100, $120. [00:15:05.21] So like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200394\">for example, I don\u2019t know if I told you, but just postcards, nice postcards, I know these fucking people\u2019s schedule. I\u2019ll talk to Matthew. I\u2019ll even hire. I\u2019ll hire one of the [inaudible] like students. I\u2019ll hire them. I\u2019ll give them like $10 an hour. I don\u2019t care. They\u2019ll go out there in the morning, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200395\">between classes, lunch time and after, right? Just hand those fucking cards out. Hand them out, right? Because they\u2019re charging what, $90, $100 or whatever, more than that for tutoring. Well so it wouldn\u2019t be that like that would happen relatively fast. But you need some revenue, some capital, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200396\">do that shit. Capital, I mean basically you need like an AmEx card.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">THERAPIST: That you can pay off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well yeah, no, no, of course. [00:16:02.20] I mean and that\u2019s the thing. My mom that\u2019s why my mom I was like mom, just stop asking. Because she keeps asking me well, so is there hope for this business? It\u2019s like I mean I get it. She\u2019s scared as fuck that they\u2019re going to give us <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D1\">a $100,000 equity line and we\u2019re just going to pfft to live on it. You know what I mean? And I\u2019m like you\u2019ve got to stop asking me that because that\u2019s like saying it\u2019s like a rhetorical that\u2019s a it\u2019s a fear question. You know what I mean? It\u2019s like I\u2019m not an idiot, I mean I\u2019ve done my research, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D2\">I know that I can be good at this, but I can\u2019t get like a gaggle of clients. Even with the money I can\u2019t. You know what I mean? I need the money to breathe a little bit, to focus, right? You also need it yourself, present yourself a certain way, right? For example, I haven\u2019t gone to one of those BNI <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D3\">things yet. You know why? Because I can\u2019t right now. [00:17:01.12] I can feel it. If I go, I\u2019ll be I know how I am. I\u2019ll pull it together. But you know what? We\u2019re talking about life coaching now. Not about being a writer, not about just being a teacher. You\u2019ve got to project something at these fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D4\">things. And I know I\u2019ll project warmth and I\u2019ll but in terms of like what would I pay this guy to be my life coach. I want I need to feel a little more...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Like your [inaudible] is more...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit, a little which I did up until like I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: Up until just the last few days, Brian. So that\u2019s also something just to keep in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: Last few days? Yeah, I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t this way when I saw you Wednesday and Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: It was getting this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It was getting there because of the wedding, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: No, it wasn\u2019t quite at this level, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a coincidence of a number of expenses at once. But on the other hand, these are going to keep happening. I mean as things come up, your car again, the rent again. [00:18:03.23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: I mean now the upside to all this is that I haven\u2019t lost my I still believe this was the right thing to do. Because I feel like in a way I feel like I somehow intuited that this was going to happen, right here. In other words, there\u2019s no...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: We talked about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: It was going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: Right, that these things now things have to happen now. You know what I mean? Like it forces action. And I kind of I think I played a game on my mental game where it\u2019s like okay, now you\u2019re a life coach and you have an office. So now what. You know what I mean? Whereas let\u2019s say I hadn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200591\">done that. So let\u2019s say I had that money now. What would\u2019ve then what? I mean that money was just going to be spent on car insurance. You know what I mean? It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d be skipping down the street right now. So it\u2019s a lot harder. But in the inverse of that is that it\u2019s going to force a bigger <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200592\">change that hopefully will then you know what I mean? [00:19:02.14] So I still feel like that was the right thing to do. But I mean something\u2019s got to give now. Something\u2019s got to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Your mom\u2019s question, is there hope, is very dangerous and hard on you also.

She\u2019s really just genuinely it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t get so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s more sincere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: Oh no, it\u2019s absolutely sincere. I mean no, I\u2019ve got to say, my mom, I\u2019m really grateful to her right now. She\u2019s being really cool. I\u2019ve got to tell you. She\u2019s being really cool. Because she doesn\u2019t fucking really understand what I mean she kind of gets what life coaching is, but she really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">believes in me. She\u2019s really I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m really impressed. [00:20:01.03] I think deep down she\u2019s probably very nervous. She\u2019s probably very trepidatious, all that shit. But I think she sees it\u2019s like a lot of other things. Anytime I\u2019ve really shown up with confidence, that this is what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200612\">going to happen, she comes around. And that\u2019s happened more and more and more, and faster. You know what I mean? Like the lag time now is gone pretty much. She has my website on her computer. So she\u2019s like sometimes I go and I read it; it\u2019s so good. So she believes in it. I think she\u2019s just I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200613\">yeah, I\u2019m worried too. I mean and but yeah, I mean it\u2019s just a pointless question, is there hope. I mean yeah, there\u2019s hope. But nothing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s also it\u2019s in your hands in a way. It\u2019s not a hope or not hope.

[00:21:03.18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I told her. I said look, I\u2019ve done all the research. Even with the home equity. I was like that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you, 400 [ph] years, 6 that\u2019s not the point because this is going to take two years, whatever. I said that\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for jobs, right? I\u2019m looking for other <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">revenue. That\u2019s why I only have two days at this [inaudible]. I mean that\u2019s the whole I mean I\u2019m doing everything right. But I was like you need a cushion. You\u2019ve got to have a cushion to ride these things out. What business has not started with capital? I\u2019m not even asking I mean it\u2019s not a restaurant, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200692\">it\u2019s not a you know what I mean, like hundreds of thousands or whatever, stock market or I mean I\u2019m talking if I had to total it up, I don\u2019t know, what are we talking? At $10,000 to $20,000 maybe. In terms of like let\u2019s say they give it time and and in the meantime, the tutoring will be up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200693\">running. I mean that I have no doubt. The tutoring will happen. It\u2019s just going to take a little time. [00:22:01.04] I mean you\u2019ve got to (pause) I mean I was glad I went to the wedding. I don\u2019t regret that. I was glad I did that. It felt really good. The island\u2019s beautiful. It felt beautiful to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200694\">on a boat. I love the ocean. It\u2019s just the coming back; it was just tough. After I got that e-mail about the I was drunk, I\u2019m sleeping on a couch. Luckily I got through the night. I didn\u2019t like stay up having a panic attack. But that boat ride back, I just I was really trying to breathe and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200695\">it was tough. So since then it\u2019s just been but I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t lost my confidence. [00:23:05.14] I also feel like people would be honest with me; I would like to think. You know what I mean? Like either here or my friends, my closest friends, who I\u2019ve talked to who are in business. I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200696\">like to think they would\u2019ve said, hmm, really, what? Are you sure? I don\u2019t know. I would hope someone would because I would do that for other people. You know what I mean? If Scott said yeah, I\u2019m leaving my job and I\u2019m going to clown school, I\u2019d be like that\u2019s awesome, but like are you sure, or maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200697\">you can do that while you still have your job or I don\u2019t know. So I feel like everyone I\u2019ve talked to even worse, what drives me crazy is oh, I need to see you. Or I you know what I mean? Oh man, like now people...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] people say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, now they need I mean that must happen, obviously, with you all the yeah, yeah.

Well clearly those are all good signs. So part of my like I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m muscling through. You know what I mean? Like yeah, I feel shitty that I\u2019ve got to tell this chick I\u2019m I mean I guess I could pay her right now, but you know what? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m hurting <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D2\">way more than she is, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s when you\u2019re saying this chick?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Eva [ph]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: So the person who\u2019s sub -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: The building.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: The space that you\u2019re...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: The building.

[inaudible] Eva, I\u2019m really I\u2019m going to try to get to you in the next few days, but this probably won\u2019t happen again after this month, but this was just a really awful month <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">financially. [00:25:07.06] I feel like an idiot doing that. It\u2019s just the first month I\u2019ve been there, but I literally don\u2019t know what else to do. I mean she\u2019s going to have to understand. And you know what? If she doesn\u2019t, then she doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s she going to do, tell me to rip up my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200792\">lease? I mean I don\u2019t live there, I don\u2019t you know what I mean? Like what the fuck.

You don\u2019t want to I felt I didn\u2019t want to tell her, but what do you want me to I then there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">no money to pay the credit card, there\u2019s no money to pay for the citation I have on the car, right? [00:26:02.19] I\u2019ve paid for everything else on the car, but there\u2019s the citation that\u2019s $100. Right? These are little things that they\u2019ve got to be paid. And those things affect your credit or your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200812\">license. This doesn\u2019t affect shit. It\u2019s a little lease on a sublet.

[00:27:12.24] That\u2019s what I would have to do. Basically this here\u2019s the thing. I would have to ask one of my friends for the amount that that deposit check sucked <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D1\">out. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. Otherwise I\u2019m fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: But the deposit, in other words, was a one-time thing, like a security deposit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which, for some reason, I either thought that wouldn\u2019t be cashed or I don\u2019t know. I mean it was all subconscious.

I\u2019m mean I\u2019m not that\u2019s not on them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">I hate it when, especially with big checks, when people wait forever then suddenly they cash it.

So that way I\u2019m not yeah, it\u2019s not like a million it\u2019s not like my mom, where she really does need to kind of balance her checkbook. For me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD1\">as long as I can see, it\u2019s like oh, yup, $60, whatever. One there\u2019s really three things that I everything else I know when it\u2019s going to come out. Like around first of the month, insurance. Around the 18th, my uncle\u2019s loan. But yeah, so because I fucked up with that deposit check, I would the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD2\">only way this would happen now, where I could either run over there today and just give her drop off a check or whatever she wants me to do, is I would have to also ask a friend for $350 so I could put that into my account so that...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Which has its own pros and cons for that friendship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">CLIENT: I think the best thing to do is feel Eva out. I think that\u2019s the way to do it. Just be very honest. Say look, this is what\u2019s going on. I know I don\u2019t like to start off this way. It\u2019s my first month and I really apologize. Won\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s just that a lot of things added up this month <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B51\">and I\u2019m just so let me know if I could have a few days. If you really need it tomorrow then I will drop off a check. I think that\u2019s the best way. That way I\u2019m not saying yeah, you\u2019ll get it in ten days. [00:30:04.12] If she absolutely needs wants it tomorrow, then I\u2019ll drop it off tomorrow. Or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B52\">I\u2019ll just say if you want me to come later today and just drop off a check for you, I will do that. When I initially signed up for the thing, for the $176, that wasn\u2019t a problem, but what I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s 176?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">CLIENT: That was the prorated September rent. So what happened was that online thing, I didn\u2019t know that it has to verify your checking account. So they deposit like a penny into your you know what I mean? One of those things. So because of that, that took days. So I was going to be late, like a day <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B91\">late or whatever. So I e-mailed her. I was like I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m waiting for this thing to be verified so I can just pay you. But that she was like oh, that\u2019s fine. Yeah, it takes like 5 or 7 days to just so hopefully she\u2019ll be okay. [00:31:01.14] So hopefully she\u2019ll be okay. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I can\u2019t imagine she would be it\u2019s not a pattern yet. It\u2019s one thing if it happens over and over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I would think I mean my gut instinct is people like you, people know what it\u2019s like to start and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I mean that\u2019s my sense, when you say I hope people would tell me, is this feels like a really good fit for you, and given that you\u2019re wanting to kind of have work on the side to earn money while continuing to write and play. And yet it sometimes feels like you don\u2019t know how quite know <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF1\">how hard it is to get started, the reality of how long it takes people to even break even. Like you know it but then some like you came in here today saying I don\u2019t have any clients yet, I have no prospects for clients. It\u2019s that kind of voice that I think..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well I think but see no, no, no. [00:32:12.19] But I didn\u2019t mean it that way. What I meant was I wouldn\u2019t be even saying that if I had that cushion. That\u2019s the thing. When you have no you don\u2019t have two nickels to rub together then of course you\u2019re going to think that. I don\u2019t mean like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C11\">a shitload of clients, but yeah, like if you don\u2019t have two nickels to rub together. I don\u2019t have like a bite. I don\u2019t have someone asking...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">THERAPIST: You start looking at it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s all I mean. No, I have no doubt that this fucking thing is going to take easily, easily at least a year to even be something. Do you know what I mean? I totally understand. And absolutely two three years to really like make some money. You know what I mean? No doubt. It\u2019s just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C51\">again, it\u2019s that breathing, that cushion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Which you do need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">CLIENT: Which you do need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">THERAPIST: This isn\u2019t like [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">CLIENT: Because like I said, I\u2019m proud. [00:33:01.25] I feel like I\u2019m doing everything right, man. For the first time in my life I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything rash here. You want to be a life coach? You can\u2019t be a life coach in a coffee shop. I\u2019m sorry. So if you\u2019re going to launch your business, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD1\">do you want to sell burgers and hot dogs on the corner of the street or do you want to sell it in an actual diner? I mean it\u2019s a business, right. So why would if Claire wanted needed to come see me, why the fuck would she come see me in a Starbucks. You know what I mean? Like someone who\u2019s professional <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD2\">and already doing well. Who wants to see a life coach [inaudible] wait, I\u2019m meeting you in a coffee shop to talk about my life and my you know what I mean? So I feel like I but I didn\u2019t go overboard. I didn\u2019t rent like a $5-, $6-, $7-, $800 off I tried to minimize. But it has to be a good space. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD3\">I feel like I\u2019m thinking things through here. But yeah, you need some capital to work with. I\u2019m trying to minimize costs, I\u2019m trying to find ways to advertise without spending a lot of money. [00:34:07.00] I mean I\u2019m not you know what I mean? But...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CF\">THERAPIST: A lot of people, when they start off, have a part time job doing something else too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D1\">CLIENT: And yeah, right, and I\u2019m looking right, right. And I\u2019m...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Even if it\u2019s $10 an hour it\u2019s still then do two days, 8 hours a day, you have $160 in your pocket at the end of a week. $100, maybe, with once they take taxes out. $120. That\u2019s something. Like that alone, like a part time job two days a week would pay your rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that\u2019s why I man, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been very open. I mean I\u2019m applying to like office jobs. I\u2019m trying not to work at a coffee shop. Even there I think I\u2019m being like realistic and open and you know what I mean? Office jobs. Fucking I mean I\u2019ve even applied to things like not <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D51\">like receptionist, but literally, like whatever, like office admin, just nonsense. [00:35:03.00] For me I think that\u2019s where tutoring it\u2019s tutoring. I really believe that. I can build that up to be something, not even just pocket money. That I\u2019ve already like I got the URL. Did I tell you that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve got a triangle business plan now. So I\u2019m like I\u2019m even like branding myself. I mean I\u2019m not I\u2019m doing this shit just I mean I think I\u2019m kind of good at this stuff. I get it. You know what I mean? Because I think that why should tutoring be just a business? I mean yeah, initially <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D91\">it\u2019ll be a little pocket change, all that stuff, but it doesn\u2019t take much. You know what I mean? Five, six students, that\u2019s even a little more than, for me, a little more than pocket change. You start building it up, you have a nice website, now you\u2019re really kind of you know what I mean? I can very <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D92\">easily get an LSAT book and kind of learn how to tutor for that. [00:36:05.21] Those fuckers charge $100, $150. So that can be a real business. I can get Matthew involved. I can really so but again...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB\">THERAPIST: You could have employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD\">CLIENT: Exactly. Or partners. We can just like almost make it like a coop that hey, I\u2019ll take 60%, you take 40, whatever. We\u2019ll just I\u2019ll figure something out. But in a way that\u2019s the frustrating part. I\u2019m still lucky. I don\u2019t have to beg for a job at Star Market. There\u2019s no reason for that. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD1\">what I mean? Like it\u2019s not there yet. There are options here to make this fucking happen. This doesn\u2019t have to be such a stressful thing. I think it really is about swallowing some pride. And we don\u2019t like to ask for help. But then what ends up happening is you need the help anyway, so like you said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD2\">it just becomes about plugging holes. And that only makes you feel shittier. [00:37:07.12] I think it\u2019s better to just be like look, there\u2019s a plan in place. And on top of everything else, it\u2019s our fucking money. It\u2019s kind of no one\u2019s business what happens. I mean it\u2019s our money. So we\u2019re not retards, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD3\">like that we need that money right now. And we\u2019ll figure it out. (pause) I don\u2019t think I took an Ativan or a Propranolol [ph] at the whole time at the wedding. [00:38:29.24] It was good. Actually I haven\u2019t been taking I\u2019ve been taking Propranolol [ph] maybe like in the evenings if I feel like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD4\">still just fucking but no Ativan.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a really heavy amount of stress and pressure, I mean to make ends meet. [00:39:02.27] And I think it makes total sense to try to get a bigger solution going than the piecemeal, which isn\u2019t going to sustain you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E1\">CLIENT: You know what it is? It\u2019s just common sense. The bigger the help then the bigger the kind of outcome, the bigger productivity. I mean it\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] just to be confident and work on it productively again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E5\">CLIENT: To feel like no, I\u2019m not worried now about next week, the week after that, and on the 28th this is due, this is due. You know what? Claire. This is due. Got to pay Claire. I\u2019ve got to do it\u2019s like no, you know what, let some things can be paid off completely. I mean imagine, right? They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200E51\">just paid off, done. I mean my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E7\">THERAPIST: How much better you\u2019d feel. Because then the debt is actually your own, back in your hands, [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200E9\">CLIENT: Exactly. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EB\">CLIENT: I think what I\u2019m going to do is have more of a like a business plan. [00:40:30.26] I mean especially now that it\u2019s I feel like it\u2019s really coming together. Like this is pretty I told my friend Jeremy who he\u2019s like a big time like policy nonprofit type dude. I told him like evocowriters <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200EB1\">and the tutoring and I was like I have this kind of idea, it\u2019s like the main there\u2019s but I said all these things have to do like I even have like logos and shit. Like for evocotutoring I have achieve as a student, grow as a person. [00:41:00.20] That\u2019s fucking brilliant. That\u2019s fucking brilliant. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200EB2\">It\u2019s not really brilliant. You know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Catchy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s catchy, right? So there\u2019s a thread. It\u2019s not just going to be about your fucking poetry. There\u2019ll be workshops about like grief and loss and you know what I mean? Like Jeremy was like holy shit, he\u2019s like this is way more thought out than I thought. He\u2019s like so I think I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200EF1\">to like get that down on paper in a more business proposal way. Maybe show it to my uncle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Show your uncle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, because I think my uncle is the more Republican he\u2019s gotten I think he\u2019s a little more like yeah, what is this life coach. Is he going to change his mind, or what\u2019s he doing now. He doesn\u2019t mean to be that way, but I think there is some of that going on, like what\u2019s this guy doing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200F31\">So I think maybe he\u2019s a business guy, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200F5\">THERAPIST: He\u2019d respond to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. [00:42:00.28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200F9\">T If you\u2019re demonstrating more proof that this is serious and this is the work you\u2019ve put in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200FB\">CLIENT: And I think my mom. too.

(pause) That sounds like the hard thing right now, is how to not let this get so much to you that you\u2019re frozen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And you know what\u2019s funny? It ebbs and flows. Like I\u2019m in a weird state of like I have these moments where suddenly I\u2019m able and I give myself credit for that. I think that\u2019s because I\u2019ve worked so hard here, that whole like being in the moment. I\u2019m able to I just get a glimpse <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200FF1\">of it. I just stop for a moment, be like what are these thoughts, really? What\u2019s going on here? I mean yeah, this sucks, but really? This is like Syrian I mean again, like today. Like Syrian refugee children, they\u2019re already fucking refugees. [00:43:10.05] They\u2019ve lost everything. They\u2019re children. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200FF2\">They\u2019re now being used for child labor. So you know what I mean? Like wait a second. Like I have a house, a roof over my head, Eva\u2019s not going to come after me in my sleep with a hatchet. I mean so I have those moments, but I think what it is, is yeah, I mean you can\u2019t it\u2019s also your context, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200FF3\">I don\u2019t live in the Middle East. I\u2019m at an age where I look at my friends, I go to the island to a wedding, I don\u2019t know about everybody else but some of my friends I know that they\u2019re doing very well. That it\u2019s not a jealousy thing, it\u2019s just a one becomes tired of not living up to one\u2019s potential, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200FF4\">here. [00:44:02.18] I mean not just money wise but just I mean so I\u2019m just coaching myself basically. It\u2019s like that\u2019s all that\u2019s happening here. Things will be fine. I\u2019m very confident in all these things I\u2019m doing. And I still feel really good. It\u2019s a week to week thing. You know what I mean? When <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200FF5\">you don\u2019t have those two when you\u2019re going to Star Market, like can I afford bread and the milk. Could I just get the I mean I\u2019ve never had that level of and as a man, whatever. I mean it\u2019s a family thing. We don\u2019t have it\u2019s just me and my mom. It\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20101\">THERAPIST: I think the other thing that sounds like it can come in where you started today, it sounds like not quite where you are right now as you\u2019re talking about it, is the feeling of the we\u2019ve talked about this is the world against you. And that sometimes it can come out as the world\u2019s falling <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201011\">apart if something like this could happen. [00:45:07.20] And it\u2019s not that it went political [inaudible] that\u2019s a fair level of debate and commentary, but I think there are ways that that can also grow out of a feeling of helplessness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah, no doubt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20105\">THERAPIST: And that you do, because of actually having been helpless when you were a kid, you lose sight sometimes. Or even if it\u2019s a moment or an hour of actually what\u2019s in your control. There are some things in your control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20107\">CLIENT: Not only that, then I\u2019m kind of not what am I helpless about really? I have like two, three, four, number of friends who are like dude, do you need just say the word. How\u2019s that helpless? My mom. You know what I mean? A house.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20106-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20106-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561738\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20109\">THERAPIST: Your uncle, who you could make a pitch to.

Even if you stay stressed the <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2010B4\">whole fucking time.
