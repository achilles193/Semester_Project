And I\u2019m sorry. Every time I rip it it\u2019s like someone took big bites out of it or something. I had such a crazy day. I don\u2019t know how I made it here on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">time. I just dropped off a U-Haul. So today was couch day. I don\u2019t have a couch in my living room. I\u2019ve been like sitting on my little ottoman and my parents kept saying like, \u2018we\u2019ll help you. Go look for something. We can contribute like one or $200 or something. Went to Peter\u2019s Furniture recently <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">with a friend and like saw a few potential things. But then I found something on Craigslist \u2013 free couch. And I went to go look at it. This was on Saturday and it looked good. It was a sleeper sofa. I had my parents visit. Very nice guy who is like a student moving. Free. I thought, oh my God, all\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">I have to do is rent a U-Haul. So I had it all planned out. My friend Carly was going to help me and so was Larry and Iris \u2013 so four of us, right? Because it\u2019s kind of heavy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they\u2019re real heavy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So, bright and early, woke up. My friends met me. We went to the storage place. The guy helped up put it on the truck. Yea, we\u2019re set. Head to the house and started trying to put it into the building. We spent about two hours trying to fit it into my living room. The door \u2013 just the frame and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">the way the door is \u2013 it was not doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Okay. You got it into your apartment but not in the living room?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, I live on the second floor. I\u2019m still on adrenalin but tonight I\u2019m sure my muscles will be so sore because we were like lifting this thing over the bannister and I don\u2019t know how we made it that far. I don\u2019t know how we made it through my front door because it was like \u2013 Carly kept joking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">\u2018were birthing it. Just come on, a little bit more, a little bit more. Turn the head.\u2019 But then the living room \u2013 not having it. So then I was like fuck. Like you know \u2013 I asked these people, it\u2019s MLK Day, like they could be off doing something \u2013 like it\u2019s their day off and I felt so bad. But they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">really great sports and they were like, \u2018well you have two options. You could leave it here in your hallway and try to sell it or give it away on Craigslist but if I were you I just wouldn\u2019t want to have anything to do with this couch anymore and we\u2019ll just put it out on the street. And I was looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">at it and it was a lot dirtier than I realized because in storage it had been sitting there for two years. It was dusty. So I was like yeah, this is going to be sitting in my hallway like and somebody\u2019s going to try to take it out of my front door and see what a big bulky thing it is. They\u2019re not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">to want it. So we took it downstairs again. I put an ad on Craigslist, curb alert. Come get your couch. My friends left but Carly stayed with me. She\u2019s like Melanie, we have the pickup truck. Let\u2019s just go to Peter\u2019s. So we called the U-Haul place, extended \u2013 you know, can I keep it another two hours? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200155\">Went to Peter\u2019s. Saw a couch that I had seen the first time and it looked like the same thing, not a sleeper, but smaller. Two hundred bucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Brand new couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: So, we were just like \u2013 I don\u2019t think we were being impulsive \u2013 let\u2019s just get it. So we got it and Carly is very, very thin and has a lot of eating issues. I suspect there might be an eating disorder because she\u2019s so abnormally thin. So I felt bad like just making her carry this thing. It wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">nearly as heavy as the first one but like she really like tried her hardest because by the end of the day she really was spent. But like we did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Like one fell swoop. And it was giving us the same tricky thing. We had to maneuver. Let\u2019s try it this way \u2013 standing up. You should have seen our faces when we got it in. Like I felt like I\u2019d just had a baby with her. We were in the room and like we were jumping and hugging each other and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">was like Carly, when you have a baby one day, when I have a baby one day \u2013 I want us to be in the room together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: It will probably be easier than this one way, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: But it looks good in the living room!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh, good. Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: And I can sit in there now because I was always sitting in my bedroom because there\u2019s nowhere else to sit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Okay. You have a one bedroom, is that what it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: One bedroom. It has a living room and a kitchen and a bathroom. Yeah, so I can\u2019t believe it and we did it and I feel so accomplished and it\u2019s done. I can entertain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I went to Costco.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: How\u2019s the place feeling to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Like home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: And now even more so like home. I\u2019ve put up some artwork. I waited until I got paid. And so Carly and I went I think on Saturday afternoon like just to look for frames. There were like \u2013 I have two huge pieces of art \u2013 like 24 x 38 or something and there were buy one, get one free frames for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">like $30. Those frames are expensive. So I got frames. I went to little like DC thrift stores and bought like little \u2013 for $1.99, like just things for the wall, a plant \u2013 at stores would be like $25. $1.99. So like it\u2019s starting to feel like home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Alright. Yeah! Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel very accomplished.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s coming together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I recently met a very nice guy that I\u2019m very excited about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. [0:06:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I mentioned him before but so I got on a dating website because this friend of mine had so much luck on it. Remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yes, the one \u2013 she\u2019s engaged after one date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I started, like it didn\u2019t seem like a match to me so I didn\u2019t respond to anyone except I found this one guy that he looked attractive and he is a psychologist. And I was like, oh wow, and he lives in Bunker Hill. He\u2019s 35 and I\u2019m showing my friend one day and scrolling through his profile <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">and she said, \u2018oh my God, I know him.\u2019 She went to grad school with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You told me about this. You hadn\u2019t met him at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. But we were doing some back and forth e-mailing and then the e-mailing turned into texting back and forth. And we were texting the whole week before we saw each other. And just the conversation is just so easy. I kept telling my friend that it feels like I\u2019ve known him for a while and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">it\u2019s very rare, I think \u2013 with girlfriends it\u2019s a little easier. But with guys it doesn\u2019t happen that often. He\u2019s witty. He has a good sense of humor and just getting to know each other \u2013 like we\u2019re talking about anything from like movies to music to our childhoods and so we went out Saturday night. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">Yes. So we met at the subway stop and I was very late because the subway was running late. I was 20 minutes late and so the whole time on the train though we were texting and so he was there waiting for me and it felt like we were already having a conversation. And I felt really excited like, oh, wow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D3\">I wanted to sit across from this person and talk with him some more.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">And we ended up going to a place, like a Mexican place and had some beer and every hour we had a shot of tequila and ordered some Mexican food and just the conversation was very entertaining. He\u2019s funny. We both disclosed more than we probably would on a first date and I think that it\u2019s because of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">field we\u2019re in. Like we just feel more comfortable with certain topics and also just because we both just happen to be very open kind of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Um hmm. He\u2019s pretty open as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: He\u2019s very open. And like so I had said a few things. What did I say? I can\u2019t remember but there were a few times in the night that I would just make little comments that are just very me, just very straightforward and so he\u2019d look at me and be like, \u2018now are you saying this because we just had <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">a shot of tequila? Or are you normally like this?\u2019 And I was like, no \u2013 I\u2019m normally like this. And he\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s weird like because I\u2019m like that too, and I normally don\u2019t encounter people that are like that. Or, I don\u2019t feel comfortable enough showing them that side of me. And at the beginning <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">we were like the first hour of sitting down and getting to know one another, we were talking about everything like how it sucks being an early career psychologist because we\u2019re so poor. And he was just so refreshingly open about it. He was like, \u2018yeah, I\u2019m like $10,000 in debt with my credit card and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200533\">I can\u2019t afford anything. And licensing is so expensive and I see all these 35 year old men walking around the streets wearing suits and I\u2019m thinking like damn, I\u2019m 35, I should be established by now. Here I am just starting. Like the things I think about all the time \u2013 he started talking about how he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200534\">really wants children one day and he really wants to be a father and if it doesn\u2019t work out with the woman he would definitely adopt. And like just stuff that most men I guess wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t had the experience with them sharing on a first date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No, no \u2013 that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: He loves what he does. He works with kids and adolescents and likes working with troubled kids like oppositional kids. He works in Ashburn and he told me the name, but I can\u2019t recall now. I think it\u2019s an agency because he worked today. They were open. He lives in Bunker Hill by himself in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">two bedroom. He said he chose to do that because it\u2019s more affordable and he can afford to live by himself. He has a car. His parents are divorced. He\u2019s traveled a lot. Great sense of humor. Like we had dinner and everything. Like at the beginning, yes, he kept saying something like, \u2018I\u2019ve been on a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">few dates on the website.\u2019 That was actually my first one. So I told him. And then I was curious and was like, \u2018so how\u2019s it been going?\u2019 And again, it\u2019s like not first dating I guess conversation but I was really curious. And he was like, \u2018really? You want to know? And I\u2019ll tell you a horrible story. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200573\">Like he says, you know, I went out with this one and all she talked about was work. Then I actually had to draw up and say can we talk about something other than work? And then she talked about ice skating and that\u2019s all she talked about. Ice skating. So we were having a good laugh about that. And he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200574\">said, normally it\u2019s been hard. It doesn\u2019t work out because I\u2019m very good at spotting women who are afraid of commitment and afraid of intimacy. And then I started getting insecure. I didn\u2019t tell him this but in my own head I\u2019m thinking, \u2018I wonder if there\u2019s that vibe around me about \u2013\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s he saying \u2013?\u2019 [0:12:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Even though I think I love intimacy and I want to be connected and I want to be in a relationship. So I kind of felt like, wow, is he picking up anything on me? What\u2019s he going to think of me afterwards? So we kept talking and he excused himself to go to the bathroom and we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">both sharing right before he went to the bathroom and I said, yeah, I tend to rush into things like physically and it\u2019s not good to do that always. And he\u2019s like, yeah, I tend to do that too. And I agreed like it\u2019s not always good to do that. You should slow down and we had this great moment where I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">said, yeah, I think that if you\u2019re with a partner, if it wasn\u2019t for the sexual stuff would you want to be friends with that person? And that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. And he\u2019s like \u2013 totally. I remember working with a couple once and that\u2019s what I told them. And I was like, oh my God, I did too. And yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B3\">I totally agree and that\u2019s why the sex should be put on hold for just a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">And then he stood up and he excused himself and he said like, well I know that we\u2019re deciding to wait but I just wanted to do this before I left and he gave me a kiss on the cheek. And to me that was like confirmation that whatever I\u2019m saying he\u2019s okay with it? Because I was getting all selfconscious <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">like am I going to fall into that category of one of these women that are afraid of intimacy and commitment? And I thought, oh, okay. And then afterwards, after dinner we went for a walk in the park and saw the ice skaters and all the lights that were still up from Christmas and he gave me a kiss and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D2\">I totally felt chemistry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: It was good. And there was this moment that like after kissing he just like held me and kind of breathed me in and I kind of did the same with him and it felt really good. Like it was a moment of \u2013 you don\u2019t do that with people unless you\u2019re more connected or you\u2019ve known them a little longer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">It felt very \u2013 not sexual \u2013 it felt more loving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: And I really liked it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Affection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Affectionate, yeah. And at the end of the night we started walking back towards the T and he said, well what do you want to do now? Do you want to go to another bar? Do you want to call it a night? And I was like, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of tired. Like we had drank like two pitchers of beer and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">like two tequila shots or something. I don\u2019t have the energy I used to so I was very honest with him again and I said, to tell you the truth I feel like sitting in the living room with you, like getting comfortable in like sweatpants and continue like talking. I wish that was what we could do. And for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">a few minutes there we contemplated going back to each other\u2019s houses but we decided not to because we both knew like then that\u2019s going to lead to more. So better not. And so we both went our separate ways, but we texted the whole way on the subway home. And he\u2019s been texting me since and we talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200693\">today and we talked through Sunday. Like he wants to see me for dinner on Wednesday. So it\u2019s a little bit scary I\u2019m noticing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What\u2019s scary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Because it feels like a very, like a potential real thing. I\u2019m just going to take it slow. I mean we\u2019re seeing each other Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I hear it though that you, I think \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh, and he\u2019s Jewish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s his name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: James Dion. His dad is protestant. His mom is Jewish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: So my mom is on cloud nine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Dad\u2019s Irish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Is it Irish? Okay. And Mom is from where? He\u2019s from around here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, he grew up \u2013 I can\u2019t remember. About an hour away or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: The other thing I\u2019ll say about it is that it sounds like you\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve talked about a man quite in terms like this. You also really \u2013 the feeling of him starting to really look at you, you know, really see you and wonder what he\u2019s seeing. And feeling vulnerable like there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">a sense of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah I had those moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah and then you\u2019re getting a lot of affirmation about him liking what he\u2019s seeing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s also, it sounds like, it\u2019s exposed. There\u2019s some level of being vulnerable and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I can\u2019t even put language to it. But I don\u2019t experience those moments like for example, I don\u2019t think I do with Brian or like with Peter. Remember I talked about Peter in here? I don\u2019t feel those moments. The only thing I could compare it to is like \u2013 remember when I talked about Jack (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: And how once he asked me like what happened in your relationship, the one that was an engagement and I started crying in front of him. And I felt really vulnerable. It was because he was really like in tune and listening, really listening. Oh, and I found it so refreshing, again, like he \u2013 we <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">were talking about our schedules, and he was like Fridays are good because I get to go into work late. But I\u2019ve still got to get up early because I have my own therapy on Friday mornings. And I was like, oh my God \u2013 he goes to therapy. So we both shared that about each other. One thing that I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">to talk about that I realized is I think having to do with the way he looks at me and like really seeing me. So there were these moments during the dinner that I guess I was just talking about whatever and he paused and looked at me and gave me this very sweet kind of expression, like he was almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200913\">looking deep into my eyes and really listening and kind of smiling in a way of like I like what I\u2019m hearing. But in a way it made me feel very vulnerable. And at the same time I didn\u2019t find it attractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Like for some reason it turned me off and I don\u2019t know why because I mean, in theory, wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful, like someone who looks at you like very engaged and endearing and listening to what you have to say and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: What did it feel like? [0:19:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Like not sexy, not \u2013 like very caring. And I remember Jack (sp?) used to look at me like that, too. And there was something about it that I\u2019m just like, ick. And I don\u2019t know why that is. And I don\u2019t know why that is. I wish that it wasn\u2019t like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: So it was like a physical reaction, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: I find it unattractive. It\u2019s like those are the only moments I found him unattractive. But those are the moments that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s important though that \u2013 it\u2019s an important thing to know. Something about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: But you would think most people like, \u2018wow, this guy\u2019s really listening to me and he\u2019s looking at me all endearing like, but to me it\u2019s just like ick, don\u2019t look at me like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t look at me like that. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Don\u2019t look at me like that. Because you just didn\u2019t find it attractive or appealing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I can almost hear you feeling it\u2019s appealing in a kind of \u201con paper\u201d kind of way but not really felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yes. Now that I reflect on it \u2013 Brian never looks at me that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: With that kind of look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: No, there\u2019s something about that look though that there\u2019s something kind of meaningful. What it means to you. What it evokes in you, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: You know what? Now that I think about it, Billy\u2019s never looked at me that way, my dad\u2019s never looked at me that way. But I think I\u2019ve had moments when my mother\u2019s looked at me that way. Just like with pride almost. Like \u2018you\u2019re beautiful.\u2019 You\u2019re a beautiful person and wow. That\u2019s that look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Wow. Pride. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s such a turn off when it comes to guys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Wow. That\u2019s important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: But like on paper, in theory, I\u2019d love for Brian to look at me like that, but now that I\u2019m reflecting back on all the moments that we\u2019ve had, he looks at me but he kind of looks through me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Interesting. Through you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Like there\u2019s something blocking because he\u2019s not emotionally connected, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but it\u2019s an interesting way to put it. Through you. In your direction but through you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Even in the intimacy of like sex when he\u2019s looking at me. He looks very intense and he\u2019s looking at me but it\u2019s just different. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I don\u2019t know why I find it unattractive. It\u2019s like gentle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">(Pause): [0:22:24 0:22:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It almost sounds like tenderness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019d call it. Why is that unattractive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good question. What do you think? Wouldn\u2019t be just how the tenderness feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Like I go back to what we\u2019ve always said about me wanting both like the sexual with the tenderness. Something having to do with that. It\u2019s almost like if we\u2019re just casual and kind of flirting and that\u2019s that sexual side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Do you remember what you were just \u2013 what were you talking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: (Pause) I think it\u2019s when I was talking about my parents and like how I once told a couple, because I saw it in a show or read it somewhere, like a good question for couples to ask them if you\u2019re in therapy is like, would you want to be friends with this person if you were not lovers? And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">told him I asked my mom that once about my stepdad and she was like ick, no way. And like I gave a little laugh and I was saying something like, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for and that\u2019s really what I want. And he was just staring and listening and smiling. I think it was about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Wow, which is right around the same topic actually. You know, what does that apply like what your mom feels about your \u2013 Billy, for instance, or your dad? There\u2019s some sort of sense of friendship and love coexisting in someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: That he, you know \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s his name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: James. Like James really looking at you with some amount of \u2013 you know, that wasn\u2019t sexualized. It sounds something different like it was affection, tenderness or something. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: And it made me feel really vulnerable and kind of scared, like naked, almost. Like I don\u2019t know \u2013 maybe if I had known him for like a year and we had been dating then I\u2019d feel completely different, maybe am I feeling that way because it\u2019s new and I just met him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think it\u2019s also something about you know, that it\u2019s interesting just to say it \u2013 what I\u2019m hearing too is that you\u2019d be more comfortable in a more sexual sphere. You know I was thinking about what you were sort of saying, \u2018boy, all I want to do is go back in sweatpants and like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">almost thinking like well that could lead to like sex. And feel like that is more maybe your comfort zone or something about vulnerability \u2013 like that doesn\u2019t like arouse the vulnerability, or maybe that did. Or maybe another way to put it is unfamiliarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: That that experience is new for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s new and it\u2019s something like I haven\u2019t heard you talk very much about having that experience with a man, you know? And it brings up not only a different man kind of a thing but a different side of yourself, like wow, somebody \u2013 a man being that way with you \u2013 and it raises inside of you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">and what it evokes inside of you is new and different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Well, why doesn\u2019t it feel like that in here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: What do you think? I was wondering that. Do you feel that ever -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Because I have felt that with you on multiple moments, like wow, we\u2019re just really in tune right now. You\u2019re listening to me. You\u2019re feeling what I\u2019m feeling and you\u2019re with me. But it doesn\u2019t like irk me \u2013 maybe because I\u2019ve known you longer? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019 remember what I used to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">at the beginning when I was just getting to know you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: Having those moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good question. Yeah, what makes it different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: (Pause) I don\u2019t know. Like maybe I just keep things in very different categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like you are my therapist and you know I have that thing where you worked at, you could be a potential supervisor, like an older mentor. Not that much older. An older mentor and you\u2019re not a potential dating person. So since there\u2019s not that stuff to think that, I can keep that separate, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that you find yourself kind of keeping that like it\u2019s psychologically off the role that I\u2019m in, makes it feel like well it\u2019s not that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not going to be this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s confusing to me when you have both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: Ah ha. Yeah, whereas with James it was a lot more, for you, a lot more \u2013 well you were looking for both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: You were looking for both. You were more available to it or something like that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Right. I was surprised that after my date, my mom asked me how it went and I told her all about it. She\u2019s like I\u2019m glad you might have found someone who can really care about you and treat you well. Which is something new. She normally doesn\u2019t say stuff like that. I think she\u2019s getting it more <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">and more like I want different things than she wanted. Like my priorities are different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: She might be learning a lot from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: Recently, she \u2013 after Christmas when I was really upset because of the Brian thing, she said on the phone that I was kind of off. She\u2019s really good at picking up on that. Something\u2019s bothering you. What\u2019s wrong? I said, nothing. I\u2019m just having problems with Brian. And she let out this kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B1\">of like, \u2018oh God, not again, please.\u2019 And I got so upset and right away I told her, mommy, every time \u2013 you complain about Billy all the time. And every time you do that\u2019s not my reaction. You know, I listen to you. I don\u2019t need you to tell me like because you sound judgmental right now. That reaction <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B2\">is you making me feel like oh, do I have to hear about this again, like you\u2019re bothering me telling me this again. I just need you to tell me, wow, that sucks, tell me more. And right away she was like, okay, okay, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. Tell me. So that was very much appreciated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Well done. Well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And more and more whenever I have a date with someone like I\u2019ll send her a picture. She used to be a lot more like oh my God he\u2019s so hot. Yes, go, go, and tell me all about it. And like more and more I\u2019ve been telling her like I used to just go for someone with looks, now I\u2019m looking for <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F1\">more than that, like I want to be attracted to them first of all, but I also want to really connect on a deep level and I think slowly over time she\u2019s been hearing that. But I know how important that is to me. I really don\u2019t think that she connected on some deep level with Billy or my dad and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F2\">why they got together. Now I remember my aunt telling me \u2013 she shouldn\u2019t have told me this but I was like 18 and she said, well you know you\u2019re mom got together with Billy just because he was good in bed. And I know that like she was all fascinated. Like oh got some American Jewish guy and he\u2019s good <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F3\">looking. And Billy was good looking when he was younger. So I appreciate that from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I mean you said you mentioned asking that question \u2013 what would you and your dad or you and Billy have been friends made her think a little bit about what did we have? Yeah, in a way there\u2019s something deep for her about, at least with Billy, the sexual relationship to her. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201111\">there were a lot of other things that went unobserved or something, about that. What else is possible? And maybe some kind of who knows what about what it did mean to get close in another way to a man. And it meant for her for somebody to really know her as well as the kind of a life that she had.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20110-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20110-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Well, she doesn\u2019t get that from them.

He just sits around the house. He does stuff on the computer. He goes on job interviews but nobody wants him. This is never going to change. He\u2019s miserable. He goes to bed now at 8 o\u2019clock at night.

It\u2019s my second one because they found bleeding like three years ago. They heard my mom had colon cancer and they\u2019re like oh, let\u2019s check you out and they happened to find blood and they were like, \u2018oh, we need to do a colonoscopy.\u2019 And they found a polyp, like a big one and so they kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B1\">of freaked out, the doctors, and said, \u2018wow, you\u2019re way too young to be having polyps. You need to get checked every three years. So now they\u2019re going to check me and if they find anything, depending on what it is, I might have to get checked in another year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: To see if it\u2019s grown or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: To see if I have anything or if I do have something they\u2019re going to do the biopsy and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: It was making me a little bit nervous. This past week actually. Like I was thinking like it\u2019s a matter of time before I get cancer. Even though that sounds like we don\u2019t know, you know, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s kind of a fantasy that comes to mind, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know why. My mom said, \u2018you\u2019re very polyp-y.\u2019 I got the pilonidal cyst when I was like 19. And then I had that polyp. And then I had these glands that like, nodes \u2013 like lymph nodes that get big whenever I get sick with the flu or cold, but my mom \u2013 like I used to freak out, oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201471\">my God, is that a cyst? Do I have a cyst? But then I realized it was just like lymph nodes. So I guess my mom made a joke once \u2013 yeah, you\u2019re very like cyst-y. You get a lot of growths. And then she had cancer and I don\u2019t know why it \u2013 I know it\u2019s unlikely.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20146-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20146-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">THERAPIST: What was her cancer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">CLIENT: Colon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Okay.

My second year of college. When I was 19 she was like 46, 45.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: But she was fine. I would take her to chemo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Maybe you told me this but I don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was reflecting with my friend Carly the other day of how much of a caretaker I\u2019ve always been to my mother. Because we got into this conversation about yeah, when my mom would go to chemo, I\u2019d go with her. She\u2019d be like \u2013 where was her husband? And it\u2019s be like, I don\u2019t know. He was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F1\">at work or he just doesn\u2019t like hospitals. I don\u2019t know, that just isn\u2019t his thing. But Carly was like, I wonder what that means to your mom though. How does she explain it? And my mom explains it like I just did. Billy\u2019s just like that. That\u2019s Billy. He doesn\u2019t sit at hospitals. But I remember I never <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F2\">got too scared because she didn\u2019t lose all her hair. She thinned and some of her eyelashes and eyebrows fell out. She lost a little bit of weight. I\u2019ll never forget, she got a haircut because she thought all her hair was going to fall out. Because she had really long hair like me and one day came in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F3\">with this haircut like hair up to here and bangs and she was just in tears, like they cut off all my hair. And I almost went and got the same haircut just to support her. I was like, I can\u2019t do it. Can\u2019t do it. She didn\u2019t lose all her hair though. We\u2019d drive to the hospital together and I\u2019d end up falling <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F4\">asleep like I\u2019d be on a chair, she\u2019d be laying down and we\u2019d be watching TV.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: While she was getting her treatment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah. She had a port and so they\u2019d put it into the port and we\u2019d like laugh because it was a big joke like the nurse would come in and check on her and here I am like drooling and then she\u2019d feel really sick when she was done so then I\u2019d drive us home and she\u2019d get in bed. Some days she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201631\">go to work afterwards at the preschool. And then I was going even further back than that and I was remembering how I\u2019m the one who stayed with my mom in the hospital when Carly was born \u2013 my sister Carly. And at the time I was in sixth grade. So I was a 12 year old and I remember that I had a cold so <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201632\">they made me wear a mask and Carly, my friend Carly, asked me again, where was Billy? And I was like, his dad was visiting from Chicago like to see his new grandchild and I guess he wanted to go out for dinner and stuff. But what about the arrival of his first born child, like? And I was like I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201633\">know. He just \u2013 that\u2019s how it was understood, like Melanie\u2019s going to stay with me. [0:40:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: Was he there for the delivery?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: Oh good. Did she have some complications?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: She had a C-section so she had to recover like for two full days. And I remember she was just in so much pain and the nurse would say, you need to walk. And so we\u2019d get on a \u2013 we\u2019d push Carly. So that\u2019s what she would lean on. And I\u2019d walk with her around the nurse\u2019s station. I was a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">girl. I was 12 years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">CLIENT: And sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">THERAPIST: Well yeah. Even in \u2013 it speaks again \u2013 maybe there\u2019s something in the air in your family around what men can offer and what one wants men to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20170-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20170-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563329\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20173\">CLIENT: Well see, I haven\u2019t seen men in that role, that nurturing role that would be \u2013 my wife, I\u2019m going to stay with you I the hospital. I\u2019m going to take you to the bathroom. I was the one that did that. So no wonder it\u2019s kind of like a turn off because those are kind of like feminine traits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20175\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I was thinking your mom might have herself had that same sort of feeling. Do I want a man that sort of sees me in that state and you know, what will she feel? Brian she feel actually turned off in some way if he is there? I mean, who knows? I mean, and then Billy not being that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201751\">kind of guy anyway. Not being that kind of guy and felt comfortable or being in a vulnerable spot himself. Being in a place with sick people and people \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m getting \u2013 this is so appropriate. But Billy is so OCD and like anti-hospitals and everything that once his dad was sick \u2013 he got cancer as well, like pancreatic. And so Billy went to visit him in the hospital and \u2013 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m telling you this story. And his stepmom was in <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201771\">the room too and he said can I use the bathroom for a minute? And the bathroom was in the room. Billy had to go to the bathroom but he had to go number two. Billy is very clean. So he needed to shower after that. So he took off all his clothes and got in the shower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">THERAPIST: With the shower in the same room, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">CLIENT: And I guess the stepmom was like, \u2018why is the shower on?\u2019 And she like opens the door and sees Billy standing there naked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Oh gosh. Oh I see, yeah. Because she was in the room too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F\">CLIENT: But like that was just so Billy. Like I just shit myself and I need to clean up immediately, right now. No waiting. So of course he wouldn\u2019t be able to put up with like my wife just had a C-section. She\u2019s bloody. She needs help going to the bathroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20181\">THERAPIST: Quote unquote messy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">THERAPIST: Wow. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">CLIENT: I guess there is a point why came to mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s an interesting association, too, to messiness. Well, I don\u2019t know. That was my \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">CLIENT: Like being ill or being sick or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Well yeah. There\u2019s something contaminating about the environment. Something germy that he needs \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F\">CLIENT: I even remember like my mom, she had a complication with the colon cancer that they had to take a piece of her intestines out so she had to be in the hospital for a while and she was hallucinating because they had given her too much morphine or whatever. And I remember her \u2013 I was staying with <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F1\">her next to her on the bed. Billy was taking care of Carly who was a little girl in elementary school at the time but now that I think about it, I could have watched her. You know, he could have stepped up and said I need to be with your mother. Her school was around the corner. I drove. He could have <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F2\">done it. But I remember like my mom like looking at the walls and like thinking my God, I see a spider. Get that spider. You know, and it was scary seeing her like that and everything. And Billy would come in. I remember him like feeding us sandwiches like \u2018oh, hey. I went to go get some food. Here <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2018F3\">you go.
