It was just a really it was a crazy weekend. Like every night James and I would go home when my dad and Joanne left which would be 1 or 2 in the morning and that would be like really early (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">just stayed out all night every night. I was like I think that would be bad for me. It was really fun. There was a lot of dancing like six hours of dancing before 2 in the morning, before I left and then it continued on. I asked (unclear) the next day, 'so what happened after we left?' and she was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">'pretty much the same thing.' She said, 'it got to the point where we were all still dancing but like you could just tell that everyone was really, really tired but didn't want to stop.' Yeah. I talked to my cousin. I have lots of cousins, like 30 first cousins. Which is like I think probably there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">are more now with people being married and things. I saw a lot of people like, 'so, what's going on in your life?' and like, 'well you know, nothing's going anymore.' 'Oh, why's that?' 'Well,' which went actually much better than I expected it to. Like I don't know if I was coherent to anybody but it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">didn't like break my I think James had a less good time but I think he had a good time. I was really enjoying myself and he was really happy about that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(PAUSE): [00:02:19 00:02:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: The thing that is the most stressful for me about being around my dad and my family is I can't control any of it. Like I don't like we were like an hour late to everything all the time. We weren't late to the wedding because we decided we were going to get there at 5:30 and the wedding starts <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">at 6 so we got there at like 5:55. There is no reason for it but I couldn't do anything about it. It was the sort of thing like there were too many people who had opinions already and all I could do was be ready when it was time to be ready and show up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: And that's what we did every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Like for everything. And like I hate driving with my dad or I hate being in a car with my dad driving because he's like he wasn't that bad this time but like I think of him as a very unsafe driver and so I panic but like we had started going to a brunch yesterday morning and we were in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">car on the road like moving out of the driveway and Joanne who was doing the GPS like navigating says, 'like where are we going? What's the address?' None of us knew. James and I didn't know because we'd gotten the invitation that had the address on it and we'd assumed that Pop and Joanne, who were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">driving, had also written that down, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. So James's solution to this was like when we were coming back yesterday was next time we go we're just going to print out directions to everything previously and just bring them with us and that way they'll be there. Which isn't going to help at all. That's not going to make any <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">difference. But it'll make him feel better. So I got kind of stressed out yesterday because it was also like we were so there's like brunch at 11 at some place that we didn't know in Birmingham which I don't know if you've been to Birmingham but there's like as far as I can tell there are like six-lane <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">highways everywhere. It's just like a driving city and so everywhere we went we were like getting on and off the interstate constantly. I lost my train of thought. So like the brunch was at 11, James's and my plane was at 2:30 at the airport which we figured, we like to get to the airport like two hours <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">ahead which is Birmingham which is insane, which is, I think bigger than James and so like okay we want to get there two hours ahead so we'll have to leave brunch at like noon and so we got to the brunch at like noon and we were supposed to meet Amanda and Jason there because they had been out all night, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">so they hadn't come home with us. So James and I had to like pack up all of their shit before we left because we left like the people were staying with, which I was a little bitter about because like -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559841\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Wait Jason and Amanda were supposed to show up there at some point because they were staying there to get their stuff together to bring it to the brunch and go to the airport with you or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: There wasn't you say that like there might have been a plan. (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I think Jason and Amanda, theoretically, were supposed to come back to the place we were staying at some point during the evening but like they stayed out all night and by the time and they didn't have any way to get back to us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay, because I'm (unclear) about where and when they crashed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, they stayed at the the wedding was at my cousin's parent's house so they stayed at the house and so we start going and Joanne's like, 'where are we going?' And then the GPS won't give her the right address.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: This is on the way to brunch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: This is on the way to the brunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: And then like Pop and Joanne have a fight because she's trying to tell Pop what to do and he can't, like none of them can make up their mind and so she's like, 'turn right, no turn left, no turn right, no turn left. No make a U-turn. And so he starts to make a U-turn and just like stops half <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">way, like a 90 degree angle through both lanes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: He's like, 'what do you think I should do, Tanya?' I'm like, 'I think you should go!' He's like, 'do you think I should turn left?' And I'm like, 'I think you should make a turn.' And when we get to the brunch my aunt is like well, 'we always leave to go to the airport like an hour and a half <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">before the flight so you can stay, it's fine.' Which she leaves from her house which is not the house that she's in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: And then like James and Joanne are trying to get directions to the airport and everyone's like, 'oh, you take 75,' but they won't tell us how to get onto 75 from the house. So it was a little bit stressful. We didn't miss our flight but we got there as they were boarding the last people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That's not how you guys usually roll.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: No. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(PAUSE): [00:08:54 00:09:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Everyone, when James said he was looking for a job said, 'oh, you should move to our city,' which was very nice but meant like my second cousin, Natalie, who is like my father's cousin, spent like telling all about jobs in pharmaceuticals that he could get in San Antonio, and he was like, 'okay.' <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">And he didn't really say, 'that's not at all what I do.'<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559841\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(PAUSE): [00:10:00 00:10:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: It's hard, like I want to know all of these people in my life better because they're all pretty badass, most of them. Some of them are strange, but you know, I have great cousins and we're all between the ages of 18 and 40 at this point so we're all doing like exciting things and like old enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">to drink and none of us has kids yet and I guess a couple of my cousins have kids but they didn't come. I think (inaudible). (Laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: But I had kind of a really fun time and I'd like to be there for more of it. You know. It kind of sucks every night you have to decide like, 'I have to go home because if I don't get like five or six hours of sleep I'm not going to make it through next week,' like that's just going to be that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">Like I just feel like I can't keep above it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">(PAUSE): [00:11:45 00:11:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: On the other hand I think this was like I think it was the first time, I can't remember another time that there's been dancing that I've just danced and not been self-conscious enough that it took me a long time just getting to it. And that was really nice. It only took me until I was this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">age to get over myself. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) It sounds like at moments you really had fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: It was really fun. It was really, really fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: That's great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh my gosh, the cousin who was getting married, her whole family but like especially her dad is like the best dancer I've ever seen. Like he was just one thing I really like about our family is like all of our parent's generation were also dancing until 2 or 3 in the morning, like it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">just doesn't stop. Not all of them, but most of them. Yeah, it was really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What kind of music?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: It started out with kind of Mo-town and then moved on to (unclear) like hip-hop. I think Journey was requested enough times that they had to play it. (Laughs), So, you know. Yeah, it was like a lot of hip-hop, some of which I knew and some of which I really didn't know. It was nice to see Amanda <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">and Jason. Jason's still planning to buy a boat and showed me pictures of the boat he's going to buy. He's really excited about it. I think both he and Pop and Joanne are really ready for him to be out of their house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, (Laughing) he's living at home now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think Joanne's really ready for him to go on. I'm sure Pop is ready for him to be gone but in kind of a quiet way. And he's like you know, 'I'm really looking forward to like hanging out with Pop and Joanne every day and not living with them.' And then it was a little bit tough because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">I couldn't remember the last couple of conversations I had with any of my cousins and I was like, 'I think I saw you last year but I don't remember what we talked about.' But yeah, it's great. They ran out of food which I had sort of been like, 'I'm just going to get food and (unclear) served and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">going to wait around because of course they're going to run out of food. And of course they ran out of food and ordered like massive amounts of chicken and had that delivered. Yeah, I feel better today than I was expecting, actually. Like less exhausted and depleted and loopy. So that's good. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559841\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">James's danced with me for like an hour and then he was done which I felt sort of bad because like he wanted me to just go dance and I wanted him to just do whatever was going to make him happy but there wasn't like that much else for him to be doing. And he talked to my parents for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">(PAUSE): [00:16:59 00:17:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: I don't know. I have a lot of aunts who well, just two now, who want to, I don't know tell me how to make my life better or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">(PAUSE): [00:17:54 00:18:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know how to deal with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">(PAUSE): [00:18:08 00:18:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Pop got really upset with Amanda and Jason after the rehearsal dinner because he was ready to go home and they were ready to go home and he felt like they had just like hid from him and were saying that they weren't going to go home with him, but were going to stay out. He was really angry about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">that. You know, I was there and so he told James and me all about it and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (Unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and but as far as I could tell he never actually told them that he was angry with them. Like the next day Amanda was like, 'is Pop mad at me?' And I was like, 'yeah, he was pretty mad at you guys.' And she was like, oh he doesn't seem like it.' And I was like okay fine. And so she like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">started to ask me about it and I was like I need to not be in this. But I already was in it. I really don't like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">(PAUSE): [00:19:23 00:19:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I didn't get a chance to talk to my dad, like at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">(PAUSE): [00:19:35 00:20:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: So they had like sparklers for everybody which should not have worked but was really beautiful. It rained all day and like stopped raining after dark. And so the sparklers were like this long and burned for two or three minutes each which was good because it took two or three minutes for everyone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">to get them lit. And it was really beautiful. I got burnt in the face with one. (Laughs) It just like hit me as I was walking by. It's fine, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Sparklers can be dangerous because they burn very, very hot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: It's like I had a little mark but it didn't hurt it much. It's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: That's how it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: It was sort of hard to be there with like yeah, James and I had a really hard first few years of marriage, like really, really hard. So Lillian I didn't talk to her very much during the weekend but at the rehearsal dinner, like did I have any advice. I was like very, very drunk. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">hung over the next day which I almost never am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: This is the mother of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: This is the bride.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Oh, this is the bride, herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, she like asked my advice. I was like, 'it's harder than anyone's going to tell you. And it's also awesome.' Like that is just what I said. I don't know what James would have said.

I spent the 10 minutes before walking down the aisle like in the air conditioned bathroom like holding my dress over my head because I thought I was going to sweat through my dress. It was like one of my clearest memories of getting married. My <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">dad did the service.

We talked, like there was a lot of negotiating about what we wanted in it because James is not like we both wanted it to be like a religious wedding but James's not really a fan of like established church so like we didn't want it to be in the church and it was really important <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">to us that it would be outside. It was really important to James that like I mean it was important to both of us that we take care of everybody so we had a tent in case it rained because we didn't have to have a tent. We had to make sure there was enough food, enough to drink. There was like some <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">dancing, but not a whole lot. Because it was like 11 in the morning where like three cars broke down in five different ways on our honeymoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: How many (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Two days after being married, stranded in Abilene, Texas, trying to get our car fixed.

The car was getting old and (unclear) shit. I think James's car had broken down when we drove down to get married so we took my dad's car on the honeymoon and then it broke down again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, James wanted to get an estimate from my dad of how long the sermon would be because it's going to be mid-90s in like Texas summer and we didn't want the service to be longer than a half an hour and my dad said, 'well, it will be somewhere between 30 seconds and an hour.' And James was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">like, 'no I just wanted you to tell me how long it's going to be.' And I said, 'James, it's going to be from seven to eight minutes.' And he was like, 'I need to talk to your dad,' and my dad was like, 'no, like I'm the preacher and I will talk however long I want to.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I see.

And I was like, 'don't worry, it's not going to be a long like there's no way it's going longer than 10 minutes, like my dad is opposed to talking longer than 10 minutes, period.'

If they want to watch it, they can. If not, they should keep doing what they're doing. But so my dad cut in after the first verse and I was like, 'but I want to keep dancing with James.'
