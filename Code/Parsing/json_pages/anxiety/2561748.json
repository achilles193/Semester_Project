So I\u2019ve been kind of keeping tabs on the university over in Assyria. Remember for a while it was kind of like I brought that up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So they just recently created a department. It\u2019s not really a literature department, but it is a\u2026I think it\u2019s called English and Communication; something like that. It\u2019s a B.A. whereas before they just had courses that were more like ESL type things. And the woman that\u2019s the Chair is the woman <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">I had spoken to from London when I was seriously thinking\u2026but at the time I don\u2019t know what her position was, but now she is the Chair of this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">So I wrote to her like two days ago and she got like right back to me. She was like yeah, there are definitely opportunities to teach course\u2026blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It\u2019s like, you know, she\u2019s like I can send you some of the course descriptions, whatever. She\u2019s like, you know, they start September and January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So I don\u2019t know. So that was one thing that happened yesterday. The other thing was a friend of mine is coming from San Diego to some conference called the Psychology and Other Institute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">[01:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s the [inaudible \u2013 01:33] other conference. That\u2019s where I was supposed to have been at yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: No shit! But yeah, so she\u2019s coming to go to that. She\u2019s a little loopy. She\u2019s one of those people. I don\u2019t know; whatever. But she\u2019s cool. She\u2019s pretty. Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">But so she\u2019s like you should look\u2026she doesn\u2019t even know what I\u2019m really doing with all this stuff, but she\u2019s like\u2026I was like well. When she told me the title I was like that sounds great. So she sent me the link and I was like wait a minute; why haven\u2019t I looked in to it? I totally forgot about it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">Like whether they have a psychology whatever whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Not only to they have it, but it might be the best fit because they have it broken down. They have a mental health \u2013 I forget what it\u2019s like \u2013 but they have three components. So you can do mental health counseling and trauma, mental health counseling and like holistic, and one other one. Maybe that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">just mental health counseling. I don\u2019t know what it is, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">And even though I hate the word \u201cholistic.\u201d It just makes me think of hippies and shit. But their description of it, at least, I like the idea that it also addresses spiritual; like it kind of tries to be a little more than just, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I mean I looked at the trauma one too, but that one, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to work in a prison.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">[03:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It can be very traumatizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s just heavy. I\u2019m fascinated\u2026I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Rape crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also I figured if I were to do something like that, you could still, of course, study trauma.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: So there\u2019s that, which looked to me\u2026and I love that they have an institute. They have some institute called Psychology and other something. I don\u2019t know. There was the website for the conference, but there\u2019s also an institute that they have. That\u2019s fucking awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">So yeah. So yeah. I don\u2019t know what to\u2026I feel like it would be very rash to move to Assyria in three months, you know what I mean. Although I\u2019m sure some of my friends are going to be like but why? So just go for a semester and teach and come back, you know. It\u2019s like, well\u2026so yeah, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">[03:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: How about forget what your friends think. What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I think what I would probably tell her is can we plan; like can we kind of continue with this dialogue and make a concrete plan for the fall, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And how do you arrive at that? I hear that that would be a suggestion about what to do, but what\u2026what\u2019s your thinking in doing it, not doing it, when to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: How can you not do it in a way? I mean I want to go to Assyria. It\u2019s a\u2026I\u2019ve always said I would go if there was a purpose to go. You\u2019d be making money. It\u2019s the university. They\u2019re going to pay you in dollars, you know. It ties in to like maybe you meet an Assyrian girl, you know what I mean. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">As a secondary kind of thing. It\u2019s fucking Assyria. That way you get that out of your system. You know what, I even went to the source and it\u2019s just not for me. Now, it just is what it is. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I don\u2019t know. Then the question is yeah, but if you started a business, what do you do? You take a break from your business to like, you know? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">[05:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Business? Starting a business or starting school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: That too. Yeah, well the school; you know how I am. I was even like fuck that. I\u2019ll just get in to the program and I\u2019ll take leave for\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll be like hey you know what, I just got an opportunity to teach at a university. I think I\u2019m going to take that for a semester. I\u2019ll figure out a way if I can do shit online; take one course online or, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">The other thing I love about them is they have deadlines, but they\u2019re not fixed. So like we suggest you get it done by this time, but it\u2019s rolling admission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">The only other thing is there is something I\u2019ve never heard of that I think no matter what you\u2019ve done before, you\u2019ve got to take it. It\u2019s called the Miller Analogy Test or something. I read about it and they were like don\u2019t even; you can\u2019t even really study for it. It consumes like\u2026I don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">the fuck, but, I was like yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">[05:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just analogies. Increasingly complex analogies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Okay. Alright, well. I\u2019m not going to worry about it too much. It\u2019s just I really hate standardized tests. But, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">So I don\u2019t know. I mean these are all good things. I just want to make sure I\u2019m\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re all possibilities. You can see through to the back of the line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, the problem is I\u2019d like to do all of them. You know what I mean. I don\u2019t want to not go to Assyria because I\u2019m a fucking life coach. Like that\u2019s, you know what I mean? That\u2019s a pretty good opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: And yet it\u2019s also tricky to think about putting it off for a year, in a way. What if you get a \u2026my clients are gone by then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good point. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to say I\u2019m going to leave my practice and leave here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Right. Aw fuck me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not done; I\u2019m just\u2026I\u2019m not even telling you not to do it. Just sort of thinking through what would that actually feel like if you had\u2026what if you had ten regular clients who\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">[07:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Right, right, right. I mean you could be like, you know, for four months, five months, I need to do our sessions by Skype or whatever, you know. Not to mention there\u2019s rent here, which is why January wouldn\u2019t make\u2026also, January is just too fast. I feel like that\u2019s making a decision pretty quickly. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">By next September, the lease would be up. So by then I would already know. It\u2019s like well it\u2019s worth keeping or it\u2019s, you know, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I thought you meant the other way around. What if I don\u2019t go to Assyria until September, but by that point they start filling, you know; they fill these slots. There are other people that want to be there. Things change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that side too. It\u2019s all worth thinking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">[07:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, she\u2019s a good\u2026obviously she would like me to come there. She\u2019s responsive, you know. But I can\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: She actually needs somebody now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t ask her to just hold. Probably she\u2019s going to say well I can\u2019t guarantee anything for September, but let\u2019s just keep, you know. That\u2019s probably the way to go because then the idea would be to just\u2026there\u2019s always probably going to be some opportunity there, it sounds like. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: And I might even be more\u2026I mean the more of this stuff I\u2019m doing, it makes me more of a desirable type. I\u2019m adding to my, you know. I don\u2019t know. But yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">The thing with this is it\u2019s not online and I also don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m assuming they\u2019ll let you go part-time \u2013 it\u2019s Jolene; I\u2019m assuming they\u2019ll let you go part-time or something. But yeah, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">But yeah, I was psyched. I mean I like the idea of UConn online this and that, but this is right here and I just love that it\u2019s more\u2026it feels like it\u2019s more thought out to me, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">Not a huge faculty, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">[09:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Something online can be very risky territory in commitment and focus and attentional issues. Anywhere where they [inaudible \u2013 09:27] for example, you\u2019re in that spectrum. You\u2019re out of ideas when you\u2019re online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Yeah. I haven\u2019t read about that. Some of them even talk about that. They\u2019re like look; you know this is great, but it\u2019s school and you\u2019ve got to be\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: You have to be in person; have the structure of it an accountability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. So yeah, I\u2019m going to contact them. There\u2019s one professor who deals with trauma, cultural identity, this and that. So I\u2019m going to, I think, e-mail him and see if, you know, we can talk or whatever. I don\u2019t know. Pretty psyched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">And the thing is I feel like, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t feel this confident, but I feel like how can I not get in in a way? You know what I mean? I just feel like with my background, I feel like I\u2019d be a dream student for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love to have you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">[10:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: And these programs are also alternative degrees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: At Jolene?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, they\u2019re also the LMHC or whatever. Oh yeah. I made sure. Yeah. The one I\u2019m thinking of is\u2026I think it\u2019s like 60 credits plus a training; like a, what do you call it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Clinical, practicum?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, you\u2019ve got to\u2026I forget what they call it, but yeah, you have to\u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: An internship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Not an internship, but I think it\u2019s training or something. You have to be working somewhere doing something. Yeah. Which that seems to be the norm if you\u2019re going to\u2026yeah. So I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">It\u2019s a tough one. I think the compromise, actually \u2013 I just thought of this \u2013 the compromise could be to just go visit Assyria. Do you know what I mean? Go meet with the lady, with Vivian, and just kind of, you know, which also shows how serious if I\u2019m fucking there in person. But also just get a feel, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">[11:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: This may seem obvious, but what? Why go to Assyria? I know that seems obvious. But\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: I feel a draw to go. You know, I\u2019ve never felt that. I\u2019ve always been like yeah, one day, whatever. But now I feel like a serious hold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: And it feels important enough to interrupt the pull towards a professional career?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well yeah, but going there is also a professional. I\u2019m a writer. I\u2019m a literature guy. So in a way that\u2019s\u2026because in the back of my mind what if I went there and it was awesome. I\u2019m getting paid in dollars and I\u2019m also getting in on the ground floor in to a university in the English Department. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">What if they, you know, come up with create a course? I mean, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So in a way you\u2019re thinking about that as even a potential for a different like the writing career path?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t know. I mean I still want to do this. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. I\u2019m just trying to figure it out. I think this is\u2026I really hit on something here that feels really good. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">[12:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And this maybe too. So I\u2019m just trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking about is that more just something wanting to get to Assyria or meeting an Assyrian girl, or is this feeling like no; it\u2019s still what if I can be on the faculty there in a permanent way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, well it feels like all those things. I mean I\u2019m killing all these birds with one stone, right. I\u2019ll go check it out, visit. If nothing else, I mean I\u2019ve lived in London. What\u2019s three\/four months in Assyria? Are you kidding? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be amazing. Whatever downsides there might <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">be to Assyria, I know enough people there. I speak fluently. It\u2019s Assyria. I mean it\u2019s probably fucking going to be amazing. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">So you know, I don\u2019t know. So yeah, I feel like it\u2019s\u2026even for my own writing, I have a feeling if I were there something, you know just like it happened in London, you know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: You have inspiration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know. So you know, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">[13:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah it is. I think I just need to feel it out and just, you know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And really think through if you did this, what would that be like? What would you be giving up? If you do this, what would that be like? What would you be giving up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Absolutely. And that\u2019s the thing. I think January, even if she were to say come here; teach whatever you want, whatever. That\u2019s really soon. If I had nothing else going on, that\u2019s a great opportunity. You know what I mean? Rent out my apartment, which would be great for my mom. And just go. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">That\u2019s fine. But this feels right. You know, this feels right here. But that feels right too in terms of the big picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">Again, my gut is telling me and my new healthy gut is telling me that I know the dean, my buddy is the Dean of the Engineering, either the Engineering or the like Sciences, whatever. And then another guy I know, not to well, but I know him, is the Dean of the Liberal Arts. And now this woman is someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C71\">who I at\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: At this university? [15:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: At the university. So I mean I don\u2019t know. I feel like there would always be a way, you know. If nothing else I could create a course. I could whatever. It seems like\u2026and yeah, I\u2019m sure there are other people that would also like to go there and teach, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s Paris, you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">what I mean. I doubt that there a million people trying to knock down the doors to move to Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">So that whatever pool of people there are, there will always be room, with my credentials and stuff, that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: So in which case does it become more about when is it work for you and for your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">[15:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. That\u2019s what I was saying, maybe September that gives me enough time to sort some things out here. Get started with this thing. Blah, blah, blah. Maybe have some clients and see what that\u2019s all about and get that going. And then take it from there. We\u2019ll see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t sound like this feels as much about in the past getting excited when someone offers you this kind of position where you feel like you have to take it just because they offered it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: No, finally all these things feel like, well, that\u2019s what should be happening. I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s because it\u2019s something you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Something I want. Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t mean like I deserve it; I just mean you know that I don\u2019t have that thing anymore where I don\u2019t feel a\u2026I don\u2019t see the reality of like, well yeah; I mean I\u2019m very qualified to teach there. It\u2019s not like I deserve it or I\u2019m so amazing. But that\u2019s what happens. You publish a book. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">in grad school for the literature. You have a lot of teaching experience. You\u2019re a good guy. You do all these different things. You\u2019re on the BBC. Then you can teach at a university. That\u2019s how these things go, you know. You know what I mean? So it doesn\u2019t feel\u2026in the past I think I had like this little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF2\">boy reaction. It was like the little kid in me. It\u2019s like, \u201cSee, people like me.\u201d And you know. That was the problem with Edinburgh. Instead of taking that as a professional, like I\u2019ll go, you know, this is a big step for me professionally, blah, blah, blah, you know. It became like this completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF3\">immature stunted, you know. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">[17:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">But I do think there\u2019s something weird going on with, again, with the girl situation. Like not weird; I think healthy. But it\u2019s like on the one hand, my sex drive is still super high, but now I notice it\u2019s not\u2026I\u2019m able to cut it off at the\u2026like before it was like well, I need to be with somebody, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">know what I mean, and I would see it through. Now, I don\u2019t need to do that. You know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Need to be with someone, meaning have sex?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Is that what you mean? I didn\u2019t know if you meant a relationship or just have something\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Pretty much sex. A relationship would be the excuse really. But really it was like blurred, you know. But now it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like if it\u2019s going to be the real thing, that would be\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">So here\u2019s another thing that\u2019s not entered the equation. It\u2019s minor, but it\u2019s still something. On Okay Stupid, right, this is a small fucking town. And Darien chicks, I\u2019ve never been a big fan of Darien. You know, I think I\u2019m more of a San Diego or like a cosmopolitan type. That\u2019s what I want. Darien <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">is college girls that end up staying here. They\u2019re kind of artsy, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">So what\u2019s ended up happening now is in my searches, all these San Diego girls keep popping up. And when you go down that, it\u2019s like a fucking rabbit hole. I mean that\u2019s\u2026I mean it\u2019s San Diego. I mean just one girl after the other and they\u2019re actually interesting and smart and the right kind of eclectic <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">that I like. You know. What\u2019s my point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">Oh, so when I look at these girls, it\u2019s funny. Like I don\u2019t think of it. Yeah, they\u2019re super beautiful, but it\u2019s not really a\u2026it is sexual, but it\u2019s not anymore. You know. That\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s just; I just like all the qualities here. You know what I mean. She\u2019s a writer. She works; she has some interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">jobs somewhere. She\u2019s traveled. She just seems like an interesting person. She\u2019s also fashionable. You know, it\u2019s San Diego. You know what I mean. It just is what it is. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">[20:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">So I\u2019m still not sure what my point is, but I think the point is that I feel like I\u2019m looking at these girls differently now, even online. Whereas basically they\u2019re being objectified. Everybody is when you\u2019re on there. But it\u2019s become more of a like, yeah, it would be cool to hang out with this person. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F51\">This is the kind of person I want in my life, you know what I mean? Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re saying even if it\u2019s the same person, the exactly the same\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">[21:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Exactly like Samantha or like Michelle. It\u2019s not someone like I just\u2026it\u2019s like I need to put her on my mantel piece and so people can see that I\u2019m with this amazing\u2026subconsciously I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a lot of what was going on. \u201cSee I\u2019m attractive.\u201d This girl, you know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">Now it\u2019s more like no; as long as the girl is not loopy, they\u2019re very pretty and they\u2019re also super interesting and\u2026I mean in a weird way it\u2019s exactly like Jolene. It\u2019s like saying, no. I\u2019m a certain kind of guy and this is the kind of girl that I think I\u2019d get on with. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not great or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">lesser; that\u2019s my aesthetic. That\u2019s my whatever, you know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">So in a way, maybe that\u2019s why Assyria. I\u2019m like what am I\u2026I\u2019m starting to feel pulled, you know what I mean. I\u2019m like I think I\u2019ve got to go San Diego to meet like an interesting girl that\u2019s worth; that\u2019s really going to get me excited about, you know\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">Or like all the other interesting Assyrian girls are all in San Francisco I don\u2019t want to go there. You know. I know I could find one if I went there, but I know San Francisco They don\u2019t really want to move. People that love San Francisco don\u2019t. They might come here for three or four years, but they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">Oregonians. That\u2019s their thing. And that\u2019s fine. But like I don\u2019t want to get\u2026does that make sense what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: What made you pause just now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">[23:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: Well I try and\u2026does it make sense?

And yet I would go places and feel like some of these other <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">people are more that, you know what I mean, than me. I\u2019m somehow not a poser, but like I\u2019m like the B grade quality and they\u2019re the A grade quality. You know, that was the feeling. You know what I mean. And I don\u2019t feel that anymore. You know. Now it\u2019s almost the opposite. I look at them and I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D2\">ah; it\u2019s some sadness here. Like you know like you start seeing through things once you don\u2019t put them up here. You\u2019re like\u2026or they\u2019re very cool people, whatever.

They\u2019re not; they\u2019re not part of some like subculture <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">or counter. They probably have a pretty good job, but you know, they dress a certain way. They have a tattoo. You know what I\u2019m saying. They\u2019re totally part of the mainstream culture, but just because they wear these glasses or they have one tattoo or because they listen to Death Cab for Cutie, they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201212\">hipsters. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">[25:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">But now that doesn\u2019t even make sense anymore. Now it\u2019s I think those words don\u2019t, you know, I don\u2019t know. Like now it\u2019s so\u2026like yeah; I\u2019m a hipster I guess. What does that mean anymore? I guess it\u2019s just an \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I always tell my friends I think it\u2019s just a word just like politically correct <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201251\">was a word that the Right made up so now people like us, you start feeling like a\u2026it\u2019s like wait, I\u2019m not trying to be politically correct here. Anytime you want to say something substantive, you had to cut yourself down and like I\u2019m not trying to be politically correct. That\u2019s like such an insidious <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201252\">way to water down people from really making strong points, you know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">I feel like hipster is like a non-important version of that. It\u2019s like a way to lump\u2026it\u2019s like what does that fucking mean really. I mean, am I a hipster? Yeah, I guess so. But okay. It\u2019s like are you a yuppie? I don\u2019t know. You know what I mean? Like what does any of that mean? I just think it\u2019s a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201271\">way to write articles in magazines and all that. So basically it doesn\u2019t mean anything to me anymore. It used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">[26:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Anymore. That\u2019s what sounds like it\u2019s\u2026it used to sound like it meant a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Well because it wasn\u2019t that. I felt like there was a time when\u2026I mean India has not been a subculture for so long, but still there was a\u2026I think those of us in my age group, we\u2019re still holding on to like, well wait a minute. No we got made fun of in high school because of this. And now my boss <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">has a tattoo and talks about, I don\u2019t know, going to Burning Man or whatever. Like you know which I never liked that to begin with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">But you know like these people are starting to\u2026\u201dI went to this speak easy. It\u2019s this bar without a sign.\u201d Shut the fuck up! Like you know those things don\u2019t mean anything to people that all their lives they have been engaged with things that they were either made fun of or they did alone, or they did <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">to escape from these douche bags, and now these douche bags are commodifying all that shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">So the word doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore. You know, so it\u2019s kind of sad in a way. Like really there\u2019s nothing. I don\u2019t know what\u2026I think only insane people now are some kind of subculture. There is no subculture. Everything is immediately on Slate.com. You know, so it doesn\u2019t\u2026I feel bad for kids now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">It\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re supposed to be rebelling. How are they supposed to rebel? Their moms have tattoos and their dads take them to, you know, Lollapalooza. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">[28:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: They\u2019ll be coming [inaudible28:34].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah, basically. No it is. It\u2019s true in a way. There\u2019s a great article in the Financial Times about global literature. It\u2019s so fucking good. I\u2019ve been trying to articulate this for a long time. This person nailed it. This is like, the Japanese guy, Murikami, Rushdie; these guys are like, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201371\">is this literature, really? Like what? They don\u2019t write, really, about the problems and like\u2026basically it\u2019s like this watered down literature that anyone, anywhere can read and feel like, oh, Japan. You know. But really, what does that fucking mean? You\u2019re in your Cape House and you feel like some kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201372\">of connection to some cultures. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">So it was a really good article about how that\u2019s all everything is now. And the same thing with yuppie, muppie; we\u2019re all whatever we are now. We\u2019re just basically consumers that one day I can be your hipster. The next day I can go to a Board meeting. You know. So, anyway, I don\u2019t know what all this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">means, but\u2026what was I saying? Oh, the chicks in San Diego. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: I mean I think one of the things that mean that deeper levels have used looking for\u2026what you\u2019re looking for? Who are you? What is your identity?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">[29:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and also you know the thing is trusting yourself. I mean my definition of hipster still exists, you know what I mean. That fucking bar, this new one; what the hell is it called? B Hotel. Remember I was telling you my friend played jazz there and I went? Those are hipsters to me. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">they\u2019re slightly older dudes that have a lot of fucking money. They bought this Bee hive people and all that. What are they? They\u2019re really just douche business guys who are smart. They\u2019re savvy. They know that wait; if I just throw on those glasses and this kind of shirt and work out a little bit and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F2\">have some book\u2026trust me, they...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">When I was at the bar, the owner, one of the owners and some other dude were examining pictures of chicks on Facebook. And the chicks were totally these young, again, like these kind of hipster, but really, these guys are rich and they\u2019re, you know, there\u2019s something going. There\u2019s a power thing going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201411\">on there. And they\u2019re like looking at them. They\u2019re being douche bags; frat boy douche bags. Right. But they\u2019re doing it in the guise of not being frat boy douche bags. To me, that is a hipster.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20140-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20140-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">Or a chick that is a chick version of that. You know that I mean. They work in advertising. They make shit load of money. But you know, they like to go to some dive bar that has the best whatever whatever and they play pool there or something, you know. It\u2019s this mixing of highbrow and lowbrow thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201431\">that that somehow makes you\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">[31:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: It still a fa\u00e7ade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: Exactly. In the past, it did mean something. Because in the past, if you were an account executive and you went to the model to play pool, that was weird. Because you know what, there were no other people like you there. You really went for whatever reason. You know, there are alcoholics and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201491\">I mean, that was a real dive bar; not a trendy dive bar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">Now, this mixture is just like, well you\u2019re just\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean anything. What other people like you go to that dive bar too. So or they go to the dive bar next door. So what? You\u2019re not proving anything to me. That doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. You might as well go to Fuddruckers. I don\u2019t fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B1\">care, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">So, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s your own ability to be able to suss that out. Right. Because you realize well I\u2019m like that too. Right. I mean I do go to dive bars. So what sets me apart? Well what sets me apart is I\u2019m not doing it for any reason other than I\u2019ve always done it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">[32:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">I did go to those bars where there were fights and I had a little friend named Louise who showed up at the bar bleeding one day for no reason. But playing pool. The next thing we know there\u2019s like a pool of blood by the pool table. That\u2019s, you know what I mean. And I\u2019m not proud of that. I\u2019m just saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201511\">you know, it was neither this or that. That\u2019s just what I did. You know what I mean. I\u2019m kind of not even really proud of it. I was probably drinking too much and who knows. You know, like I was there too often, you know. But you know what I\u2019m saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: So I don\u2019t need to put on my profile, \u201cI can dress up in a suit and I can also have a high life.\u201d That\u2019s what a lot of these profiles have this like, \u201cThe girls can have champagne, but they can also throw on jeans and go to the\u2026\u201d Enough. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">It\u2019s people just trying to\u2026it\u2019s branding. You know, it\u2019s branding. That\u2019s why Assyria. See, that\u2019s why. I\u2019m sure they have a lot of fucking problems. This cluster fuck hasn\u2019t reached Assyria yet. It will. You know it\u2019s going to get there. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">[33:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: You know you grew up in a family that was all about the fa\u00e7ade to an extreme degree. So I think part of their, even the ways that hipster has been, it becomes another category that is\u2026it\u2019s a rebellious one and so it expresses a form of identity that didn\u2019t have a place in your family that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B1\">gets to be loud out there. And yet I think what I hear you saying now is like now it\u2019s more about if that\u2019s doing that because I like it. It becomes even more yours instead of being because it\u2019s a rebelling against something, which is very different. To find yourself; to go to the bar because you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B2\">to be at the bar to drink the champagne if you want to drink the champagne, to drink the beer if you want to drink the beer.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2015A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561748\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">CLIENT: What do you mean? Oh, so you mean that like before maybe I wasn\u2019t doing it because I wanted to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">THERAPIST: I think you were all along.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I definitely was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">[34:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: No. My point is that you were, but I think it wasn\u2019t always clear that you were. In other words, there has been some safety in facades. It\u2019s a different form of fa\u00e7ade, you know. It sounds like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Hmm, see to me it\u2019s almost the opposite. I feel like that was never a fa\u00e7ade. I always felt like me when I was like writing on my jeans and cutting my hair weird. That felt like home to me. The fa\u00e7ade was dealing with these fucking idiots. That was the fa\u00e7ade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: And that becomes a fa\u00e7ade how? Their fa\u00e7ade?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: Because I have to deal with them in a way that\u2019s not me. I can\u2019t call them racist, because I don\u2019t want to fight. I have to, you know what I mean. I have to constantly navigate their bullshit. You know. Whereas then, when I\u2019d be alone, that was\u2026that felt so\u2026and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">People like me, that\u2019s why it\u2019s a matter of like fuck you a little bit because that was so personal to people like me. And I was like I\u2019m not cutting my hair because it looks cooler; it just feels right to me. And I don\u2019t give a shit if people are going to make fun of me, or all that stuff. It wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B2\">about\u2026Urban Outfitters wasn\u2019t selling ripped jeans with writing on them or whatever. That were kids doing that, you know. Or the skinny tie. That was way before people\u2026so that felt like home for people like me. It felt like wow; I can really let my guard down. And yeah, it is kind of like a fuck you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B3\">but it\u2019s like from the heart. It\u2019s not like a\u2026it\u2019s not like a fuck you I\u2019m just going to, again. Or, you know, it\u2019s like these are my boundaries. This is my little world and you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">[36:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">THERAPIST: So in which case the difference now is about finding yourself, who you are, all day long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: Instead of like I can go to the bar and find it because I have a home there, but I have to be a different person at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">THERAPIST: How do you\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">CLIENT: The difference is also that it\u2019s not some kind of badge of honor. You\u2019re just a person. So yeah; can I go to a Board meeting? Big fucking deal. Of course I can go to a Board meeting. Can I go to\u2026? What are we in like Africa? That\u2019s not something to even bring up to me. You know, that\u2019s the issue. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201791\">To me it\u2019s like the minute someone has to say that shit\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s already about them putting on a fa\u00e7ade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">CLIENT: Exactly. It\u2019s not about hipster or not hipster; it\u2019s about douche baggery. You know, it\u2019s like you\u2019re just being a douche. Like I don\u2019t; don\u2019t put pictures of yourself doing Yoga. Like I don\u2019t give a fuck. Like what is that supposed to mean to me? You try to stay fit so you\u2019re mindful or something? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D1\">Like people just can\u2019t chill out. I\u2019m just like; you know what, like I don\u2019t need a list of the things that make me either cool or unique. There are a million people like you doing those exact same things. So you know.
